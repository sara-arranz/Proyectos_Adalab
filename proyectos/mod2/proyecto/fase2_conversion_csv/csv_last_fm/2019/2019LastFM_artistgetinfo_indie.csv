Valentín Oliva, (Buenos Aires, Argentina; 23 de enero de 1998) conocido artísticamente como Wos, es un rapero, freestyler argentino. Es conocido por ser el actual campeón en el torneo internacional de Red Bull Batalla de los Gallos.

Carrera

Wos arrancó desde muy pequeño rapeando en las plazas y participando en competencias como El Quinto Escalón, donde ya demostraba un gran potencial y sobre todo mucho coraje. Pero fue en 2016 cuando demostró que su nivel estaba para mucho más que una plaza, ganando así varias fechas del Quinto Escalón, tirando acotes memorables, que se viralizaron mucho en las redes sociales y salió campeón de la fecha final, dejando en el camino a Dtoke en la primera ronda y derrotando en la final a Klan. Wos es uno de los que más veces logró ganar la competencia de El Quinto Escalón.

En el 2017 participó en la Final Nacional Red Bull Batalla de los Gallos por primera vez, donde salió campeón derrotando, entre otros, a Papo, uno de los candidatos en los Cuartos de final y a Klan en la final y así se clasificó a la Internacional que se llevó a cabo en México en la cual quedó segundo detrás de Aczino.

También participó en otras competencias como la Double AA que ganaría en Argentina. En la Red Bull Batalla de los Gallos Internacional 2018 se coronó campeón. En FMS Argentina 2018 Wos también salió victorioso después de ganarle en la final a Papo. También tuvo un papel protagonista en la película Las Vegas dirigida por Juan Villegas.

Actualmente en 2019 anunció su retiro de la FMS para desviar su atención a su carrera musical, sin embargo seguirá activo en otras competencias, como por ejemplo GodLevel, en la cual represento a Argentina junto a Papo y Trueno en la que quedaron subcampeones, y la final internacional de Red Bull 2019.

On August 2, 2019, Claire released her debut studio album under FADER Label titled ""Immunity"". The album featured production from not only Claire but also Rostam Batmanglij of Vampire Weekend fame, who also contributed to songwriting. Featuring 11 tracks, 3 of which were released as singles, the album explores Claire's personal life, including her struggles with mental illness and sexuality. ""Immunity"" blends Claire's lo-fi, bedroom pop style along with more elements of traditional pop and expands upon it, creating a distinctive sound from much of her earlier work. The LP earned a spot in the top albums of 2019 from many publications, including Billboard, Pitchfork, and The Guardian.

On July 16, 2021, Claire released her second album, “Sling”, with the help of Jack Antonoff. The album was a major stylistic turning point for Claire. She also sang backup vocals in Lorde’s song Solar Power along with Phoebe Bridgers that same year.

Kahan followed it up with the release of ""Northern Attitude"" on September 16.

On October 14, 2022, Kahan released his album Stick Season. According to early reviews of the album from AP News, ""There’s irony there because these feel like songs both longtime listeners and newer fans will want to belt back to Kahan — not because they’re produced for stadiums or arenas, but because they’re full of nostalgic melodies that will resonate far beyond New England."" Kahan wrote this album during the pandemic which he spent back home in Vermont. Stick Season leans more into the folk genre than the rest of his older music which were more pop sounding. Kahan says that in his album, Stick Season, he wanted to pay homage to the folk singers that he grew up listening to. He adds that his greatest goal as a songwriter is to write music that other people can relate to and to be able to throw that lifeline to someone.

On March 17, 2023, Kahan was featured on Joy Oladokun's single ""We're All Gonna Die"", which was also released as part of her April 2023 album, Proof of Life.

On June 9, 2023, Kahan released a deluxe version of Stick Season titled, Stick Season (We'll All Be Here Forever), which includes seven previously unreleased tracks. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Noah+Kahan"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the beginning they were influenced by The Cure (they toured with them in Spain), Radiohead and R.E.M. Today they have the personal Love of Lesbian sound and style. There is always a ""sold out"" at all their concerts. Each one is a mix of party-concert-celebration-catharsis.
Santi Balmes, the writer, main composer, and charismatic leader brings to each album excellent lyrics of high composition, from a delicious sense of humour to deep emotional tales. Their first three albums are sung in English, but their more acclaimed album is Maniobras de Escapismo (2005), the first sung in Spanish. With ""Cuentos Chinos Para Niños Del Japón"" (2007) they confirm again the band in the scene.
In 2009 (March 24) , they publish ""1999 (o como generar incendios de nieve con una lupa enfocada a la luna)"" a concept album that tells, 10 years later, the life of a relationship between a boy and a girl during 1999 (the year of their first album). It includes songs to dance to, to listen to in intimacy or just to think about.
Videoclips are another face of the LOL experience;  the first video of ""1999..."" is ""Club de fans de John Boy""  and the second one is ""Te hiero mucho (Historia del amante guisante)"" both directed by the influent director Lyona, who also directed ""Universos Infinitos"" from ""Cuentos chinos para niños del Japón"".

After attending Nashville’s Belmont University for a semester, the Atlanta-native decided to pursue a music career back home.

Webster’s genre-defying music isn’t her only creative crossover — she’s gained recognition in Atlanta’s hip-hop scene for her Kehinde Wiley-esque photography of rappers like Lil Yachty, Migos’ Offset, and D.R.A.M. Inspired by a photography class she took at Belmont — “It’s mainly the only reason I’m glad I went,” she explains — Webster channels her quirky personal style and love of monochromes into her portraiture.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Faye+Webster"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

53,vendredi sur mer,362603,5260821,"From Geneva, Switzerland, although her nationality is usually defined as Franco-Swiss. Her name is Charline Mignot, but artistically she is known as Vendredi sur Mer.

Coming into the world in the mid 90's, Charline grows up with a very introverted view of the world around her. As she grew up and wanted to explain her surroundings in her own way, she moved more and more towards the arts, fashion and photography, and it is in the latter that she dedicated her studies.

In his quest to make his own mark and push his own boundaries within the aesthetics he used for his photographs, he eventually started writing songs. The first time was with the idea of using self-made music for her photo shoots, knowing that music would help set the mood within the shoot. That's how her first song, ""Est-ce que tu t'en souviens"", was created.

Their style is quite distinctive, having been described as dream-pop, electro-pop, electro-ambient and even ""space-disco"". The marriage of Charline's art and direction caught the attention of Swiss and French producers, including Lewis Ofman, who produced her most listened-to single, ""La femme á la peau bleue"", in 2016, a song that became famous in the fashion world as the official music for one of Sonia Rykiel's 2017 collections.

Mignot's voice is always soft, as if she were singing from a reverie. She uses a spoken voice in all her songs, which come across best as storytelling about women, sensuality, love and heartbreak. In some interviews she has expressed frustration at being associated with radical feminism just because her music is about women, ""as if it's something abnormal or radicalised for a woman to write about women instead of men"", so she often says that she goes between one gender and the other, to create confusion among listeners.

Vendredi sur Mer's first EP came out in 2017 and is called ""Marée basse"", the only studio album she has released to date is called ""Premiers émois"" and was released in 2019 with the single ""Chewing-Gum"".

Do you like women who make music independently and maintain a beautiful aesthetic to match their creations and their music videos?

54,fkj,699524,12333792,"French Kiwi Juice, or FKJ for short, is the moniker of Vincent Fenton, a nod to his Gallic mother and New Zealander father. He grew up in a small French village outside of Tours, isolated from his friends, and so he turned to music for company. He got hooked on his parents’ records by Pink Floyd, Billie Holliday, Nina Simone and Queen, and took up guitar; then, aged seven, the saxophone. “I would play with whatever toys were around, and that helped develop my imagination, and then that evolved into making instruments – I found whatever I could and started putting it together,” he said of his rudimentary one-man bands. 

That one-man-band mentality has persisted, collecting instruments as he goes, though he’s never been formally trained; instead developing his own ear. Prestigious music colleges were too expensive and so he eventually moved to Paris to study the sound and film, which helped give him grounding in cinematic arrangements. He fell into the city’s nightlife scene, playing live instruments in clubs in Paris, and became known as a Soundcloud producer who blended house and jazz, as on his vibey 2013 Time For A Change EP. 

But then in 2015, he played a festival in the Philippines that changed everything. There he met June, who performs as ((( O )))) and who he’d remixed a track for. Eventually they got married and moved in together on an island off the country’s south coast, where they have created a tropical studio idyll that looks out onto lush rainforest. You can see it in the live session FKJ recorded there in 2019 (over 19m views on YouTube), as he flits between piano, singing and sax.

The seeds for his more introspective sound were sown with his 2017 self-titled debut, while the track that he did with Masego that same year, ‘Tadow’, further evidenced his effortless ear for intriguing rhythms – the pair made the hip-hop-speared jazz jam out of a day-long improvisation in Paris, duelling on their saxophones, their keyboards and drums interlocking effortlessly. There’s an ease to his collaborations – nothing forced; artists who are like-minded about being guided by groove – see the meeting of minds on the track “Risk’ with the American rapper Bas or his latest remix for PinkPantheress. 

But in 2019, FKJ started drawing more from within. He released the Ylang Ylang EP, the result of a tumultuous and devastating year when June miscarried. The couple cancelled their commitments and holed up together to recuperate and make music. The sweepingly romantic jazz of the title track is the EP’s centrepiece, encircled by crisp R&B beats, acoustic guitar flourishes and ambitious sax instrumentals on the other songs. The making of it soothed them as much as it did his growing international fanbase. “With music, I feel safe,” he says. “So when I hear that my music is healing for people, it’s the best compliment.” 

Back in the Philippines, with no wifi and an impending global lockdown, FKJ was quite literally cut off from the world, able to explore music’s endless possibilities. “Sometimes I would get into it for the whole night and go to bed when the sun came up.” Out of this freedom comes an expressionistic, touching album that’s impossible to pin down. There’s no more hiding behind a branch of leaves, as he did on the cover of his 2017 debut: V I N C E N T marks FKJ out as a crucial new voice. He’s redefining chillout music with his bursts of late-night jazz sax and piano, coupled with his wood-cabin whispery vocals, recalling Bon Iver’s early work, and those Santana-styled guitar flourishes. 

V I N C E N T is a marvel – and testament to the magic that can happen when you dig deep. “This was a challenging record,” he says. “I’m a perfectionist and it’s hard to shake that off. But once I did, and I let the music take over, I felt totally free.” <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/FKJ"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

55,the black keys,3005321,170192675,"The Black Keys is an alternative rock  group from Akron, Ohio, United States which formed in 2001, consisting of singer and guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney. The band name was inspired by a schizophrenic artist and friend in Akron, who used the term ""black keys"" to describe things he disliked or people he did not trust. The Black Keys have roots in traditional blues and psychedelic rock stylings.

They released their first album, The Big Come Up, in 2002, followed by Thickfreakness in 2003, and Rubber Factory in 2004. October 2005 saw the release of the DVD Live, recorded live at The Metro Theatre in Sydney, Australia March 18, 2005. In 2006 they released Magic Potion, as well as the lesser-known Chulahoma and a single version of Your Touch.

One of their trademarks is their preference for simple, lo-fi recording techniques. They refuse to use big-name studios, and do most recording, producing, and mixing themselves. Most of Thickfreakness was recorded in about 14 hours in Carney's basement, using only an early 80's Tascam 388 8-track recorder. Often, their recordings still have background noises (such as an owl hooting).

The Black Keys have achieved increasing critical acclaim and recognition since their debut album, which itself received praise from Rolling Stone magazine. Time magazine named them one of the ""10 Best Acts of 2003"" (behind OutKast and The White Stripes). They have supported a number of bands: they toured with Sleater-Kinney in 2003, had a short stint opening for Beck, have recently opened for Radiohead on the American leg of their brief 2006 tour, and performed at Lollapalooza in 2005 and 2007.

Famous followers of the band include Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead, and Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammet. Matt Helders, drummer for the Arctic Monkeys, can be seen in a Black Keys T-Shirt in an interview on MTV's RAW. 

Their song ""When the Lights Go Out"" was featured in the 2007 film Black Snake Moan, and also on the soundtrack for that movie. The Black Keys were included in the soundtrack of the 2003 movie School of Rock with their song, ""Set You Free"". ""Lies"" was featured in the conclusion of the February 4, 2009 episode of Lie to Me. One of their songs, ""Girl Is on My Mind"", was used in a 2006 Sony Ericsson advertisement, starring the tennis players Ana Ivanović and Daniela Hantuchová, gaining the band more commercial recognition. It was also used in a 2006 Victoria's Secret commercial featuring Heidi Klum and could be heard in the movies Rest Stop and Cashback. Their song ""10 am Automatic"" was used in the video game MLB '06: The Show, The O.C., The Go-Getter, and was also used in a 2007 American Express commercial starring Shaun White. ""Your Touch"" was featured in a 2007 Lee's jeans commercial, and can be heard both in an episode of NBC's Friday Night Lights and in an episode of ""Eastbound and Down"". Their cover ""Grown So Ugly"" can be heard in the background of the going away party in the 2007 film Cloverfield. ""Strange Times"" is used in Grand Theft Auto IV on the in-game radio station Radio Broker. ""Strange Times"" can also be heard during a preview for ABC's The Mole, and the trailer for season three of the Showtime series Dexter, as well as a promo for Gossip Girl. Their song ""Just Got To Be"" is used on the soundtrack for the video game NHL 08, and ""Hard Row"" is featured in the premiere episode of the FX show Sons of Anarchy. Sons of Anarchy has gone on to use ""Keep Me"" in both Episodes 6 and 7, as well as ""Busted"" in episode 7. The song ""Lies"" is featured in the advertising campaign for the third season of HBO's Big Love. ""The Breaks"" can be heard in Guy Ritchie' film RocknRolla. ""Your Touch"" can also be heard in the HBO series ""Entourage"" in the episode ""Manic Monday"", during the opening scenes. The song ""Psychotic Girl"" is featured the episode ""Messin' with the Kid"" in season 6 of One Tree Hill. ""I'll Be Your Man"" is the opening theme song for the HBO show Hungand was also featured in an episode of the FX Network show Rescue Me. ""Your Touch"" can also be heard in the film Zombieland and in an episode of ""Eastbound and Down"" on HBO. The song ""I Got Mine"" has been used in HBO's sports reality series 24/7 Pacquiao-Hatton"" [13] as well as background music for the 2009 American League Championship Series. The song ""Next Girl"" is featured in the in game radio of Saints Row the Third.

Their fourth record that Danger Mouse produced Attack & Release  was out April 1st 2008. The duo's fifth album is the first one recorded in a proper studio.

The Band's fifth album, ""Brothers"" was released in spring 2010 and has seen increasing amounts of exposure to the ""Dancing T-Rex"" video for the song ""Tighten Up"" that went viral...until the band asked it to be removed because they felt it made light of their music.

The track ""Tighten Up"" was also used as the background music for a Subaru Legacy commercial and on the FIFA 2011 Soundtrack.

Co-produced by Danger Mouse, the album was released to critical acclaim, receiving positive reviews from The Rolling Stones, NME and more. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly commented on ""El Camino"", saying that ""El Camino trades the soulful stylings of Brothers for harder-driving, faster-riffing rock & roll"". At the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, El Camino won the award for Best Rock Album, while ""Lonely Boy"" received multiple honors, taking 'Best Rock Performance' and 'Best Rock Song'. The album has sold 1.4 million copies in the United States to date.

Her songs ""Alaska"" and ""Dog Years"" placed numbers 64 and 173 on Triple J Hottest 100, 2016, respectively.

After the Pharrell video went viral, several different record labels tried to sign Rogers.

Track editing and cueing is kept to a minimum in the DIY, abrupt tradition, giving freshness to the music.

Weyes Blood has existed since at least 2006, starting as a conventional folk singer in an unamplified universe, then transforming into a more a crouched/hieroglyphic electronic chasm style, culminating in a European tour with Axolotl. After two seasons of hibernation and a relocation to Baltimore, she materialized her evolution and began writing/playing the darkly haunted narcotic drifter ballads that make up ""The Outside Room"", her first official full-length. The entire album was recorded, mixed and produced by Mering herself, then mastered by good friend Graham Lambkin. The record has shadows of ""The Shadow Ring"" in the oddly creaking ambient sounds and stark, nuanced production, which lend the eerily beautiful folk laments à la Nico. There’s still echoes of her old drone / tape-ghost-clouds moods on tracks like ""In the Isle of Agnitio"" and the long, bells-laden outro to ""Romneydale"", but the bulk of the LP is swooning and sweeping, with Natalie’s gorgeous, quasi-Teutonic vox leading the way. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Weyes+Blood"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Joshua Harmon: lead vocals and guitar 

Jonas Swanson: lead guitar and vocals 

KJ Ward: bass guitar 

Juice Welch: drummer and background vocals   

The band started when Josh, having heard of local drummer Juice Welch, introduced himself and asked if he wanted to start a band. They immediately started working on arrangements for some of Josh's songs. Later Josh met lead guitarist and vocalist Jonas Swanson while waiting in line for an open mic at the Velour in Provo city. Neither of them got on the list to play that night, so they sat on a park bench outside the venue and played their songs to each other until they ran out of stuff to play. Josh invited Jonas to come down and play with him and Juice. It was that night that Out of Tune, a song Josh had been holding onto since he was 16, came to life when they arranged it as a group.   In spring of 2018 the band began recording together. They released their self produced EP Elevator Days on June 3, 2018 and played their first show a few short weeks after.  They released their first full length LP, When We Were Friends on January 27th, 2019.   The group is currently writing new material that they say is a product of the co-writing chemistry that has grown between Jonas & Joshua since their friendship began. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Backseat+Lovers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

70,vansire,1435614,31203543,"Vansire is a dream pop band from Rochester, Minnesota consisting of Josh Augustin and Sam Winemiller. They are currently signed to Spirit Goth Records. Vansire has performed at ROCKChester and First Avenue, played a live session with Audiotree, and collaborated with artists such as Chester Watson, Jeremiah Jae, and Mick Jenkins.

Vansire formed as band members Josh Augustin (vocals, synths, guitar, and drums) and Sam Winemiller (bass, guitar, and synths) were attending Century High School in Rochester, Minnesota. Augustin and Winemiller met while playing together on the school's drumline and continued to find themselves performing together through school activities (such as concert band and pit orchestra), something the duo says contributed to their creative synergy and friendship, which later helped in Vansire's formation.

In the summer of 2015, Winemiller approached Augustin after practice for the school's drumline with an idea to make a band ""that sounds like Mac [DeMarco]"". The pair's early recordings were made by holding instruments to the internal microphone of an iPad running GarageBand. Augustin and Winemiller, initially unsure of what to call their new project, turned to an online random word generator that landed on ""vansire"", an alternative name for the Marsh mongoose. From there, the two continued to record together in their basements, living rooms, and bedrooms under the new Vansire moniker.

In August 2016, Vansire self-released their first album, ""Reflections and Reveries"". The duo recorded the album entirely in Winemiller's basement in a roughly one-year period from August 2015 to August 2016, and included Winemiller's brother, Issac, on bass for some songs.

During this time, Augustin began studying at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and Oberlin College, while Winemiller started at the University of Minnesota. Despite the distance, the duo vowed to remain committed to the Vansire project, now describing it as ""a long-distance band relationship.""

Vansire released their second album Angel Youth in April 2018 on Spirit Goth Records. Augustin and Winemiller produced and mastered the album themselves, and it is the band's first full-length album that featured collaborations with other artists.

In June 2019, the duo released their single ""Metamodernity"", also recording an Audiotree Live session at Audiotree's studios in Chicago later that August.

In July 2020, Vansire released ""Central Time"", a single featuring Chicago-based rapper Mick Jenkins in their first collaboration together. In an interview announcing the single, Augustin said the single began as an instrumental demo that Winemiller sent him in September 2019, which sat untouched for roughly eight months until the duo returned back to it, finishing it up at the beginning of June 2020.

During this period of the band's history, Augustin said that Vansire found itself leaning in an ""increasingly dance-oriented direction"" with regard to musical sound and that the duo has started to draw influence from more ""dancey, funk-imbued music"".

On October 16, 2020, Vansire released ""After Fillmore County"", a seven-song EP that brought back FLOOR CRY, and featured Philadelphia-based rapper Ivy Sole. In April 2021, Vansire released a remix of Sydney-based producer-artist Swaine Delgado's ""F Me Up"", their first remix. In May 2022, Vansire released their third LP, The Modern Western World"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Vansire"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

71,leisure,409666,5314164,"There are five artists with the name Leisure:

1) LEISURE is a band from New Zealand that launched on SoundCloud in 2015 with 'Got It Bad.'  https://soundcloud.com/theleisurecollective

Made up of five independently talented and successful members who were looking for a new creative outlet unconstrained by over-thinking, over-planning, and excessive control; LEISURE are an anomaly in the music industry. This unusual melting-pot of contributions means LEISURE is greater than the sum of its parts, each member bringing different influences from 70s funk, to 90s rap and R&B, all the way to dance music from the early 2000s. Each member also brings a different skill set – strong pop song writing sensibilities, experimental production techniques, and the talent to mix and master their own work.

Having amassed over 60 million streams on their debut album, which entered at #2 in the NZ charts, they have built a rabid fan following that has seen their very occasional live shows sell out and become the stuff of legends – recently performing their debut, backed by the 72-piece Auckland Philharmonic Orchestra, to a sold-out Auckland Town Hall.

Their music has become a staple in the sync world, they have collaborated with hip-hop star, Goldlink, and have now signed globally to US / UK record label Nettwerk for their forthcoming album.

Their self-titled debut album release was critically acclaimed and with their sophomore album complete, fans worldwide continue to connect with their manifesto of living the good life, and their over-riding code to “keep things LEISURE”.

2) Leisure is a band from Boston, MA consisting of Jed Rouhana, Sam Hamad, and Chris Link. The three members played in bands together since High School. In 2010, they gave a demo CD to JR White of the San Francisco band Girls, during one of Girls' Boston shows. The CD included ""It's Alright (On The Suez Canal)"". White subsequently invited Leisure to open on their US tour. After touring, Leisure began work on their debut album ""Plastic Soul"", which they self-produced. The album is set to be released in 2012. More information can be found on their official website,www.leisureofficial.com and facebook page, www.facebook.com/leisuremusic

3) Leisure featured Middle Class Rut hitmakers Zack Lopez and Sean Stockham and a rotating cast of singers. The earliest incarnation of the band, which included D. Scott Sault, who would later front the short-lived Atlantic Records act Quitter, self-released an EP, Polygraph Alliance, in 1999. After Sault's departure the band briefly included Die Trying (Island) frontman Jassen Jensen. The band eventually landed a deal with Dreamworks, then fronted by Darren, and, shortly thereafter, at least briefly, ex-Hotwire frontman Rus Martin stepped in. The band's one and only national tour was opening for CKY. No word on if an album was ever completed, though several demos, some more impressive (""Deathtrap"") than others, do exist. 

4) Leisure was formed 1998 in New York City. They play non-Britpop and sing about faith, hope and love. Drew sings/play guitar, Peter plays keys/sings, Steve plays bass and Ted plays guitar/sings. They had recorded 2 EP’s (Occasional Music 1.0 & 2.0) with SoundOptik (Ryan Adams, The Strokes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion), Jesse Sprinkle (Poor Old Lu, Serene UK, Starflyer 59) and Andrew D. Prickett (The Violet Burning, Cush, The Prayer Chain). Their music can be heard on XM Satellite Radio.

5) Leisure is still a young band but has some experience however. Formed in November 2004 with the idea of playing only covers. In view of the result of exalting rehearsals, the band decided quickly, under the impulse of Francois, the bands songwriter, to create a set entirely made of their own compositions. The band chose clearly its style, under the British influence and sensitive to each decade (from The Beatles, the Kinks to The Libertines as well as Oasis). Leisure is made up of five members : a drummer with a heavy strike (Nessim, 23), a bassist who gives a certain feminine touch to the band (Coralie, 19), a rhythmical thorough guitarist (Nicolas, 22), a soloist gifted guitarist (Francois, 21) and a charismatic singer (Siamack, 20). The year 2005 has meant toil for the band, accumulating compositions and hours of intensive rehearsals. The band performed at that time in the main venues of Bordeaux, like lInca, lAssonette, la Centrale and some open air gigs like the participation to the festival « Tête de lArt ». At the end of the year, Leisure recorded his first demo called « Shoots in the Streets », recorded and mixed by Kim, produced by the band itself and containing five of their songs played live. The year 2006 is promising for the band which had the honor to play in renowned places such as lHeretic et le SonArt, still improving their set on stage and their compositions. They were also broadcasted several times on radios, like Radio Sauvagine (94.9 FM). After having had the ambition to be known in Bordeaux, the band thinks of exporting itself little by little in whole France. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Leisure"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

75,the national,2334837,195211101,"The National is an indie rock band formed in 1999, by friends from Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. The band's lyrics are written and sung by Matt Berninger in a distinctive, deep baritone. The rest of the band is composed of two pairs of brothers: Aaron Dessner (guitar, bass, keyboards), Bryce Dessner (guitar), Scott Devendorf (bass, guitar) and Bryan Devendorf (drums). 

Their self-titled debut album""The National"" (Brassland 2001) was recorded and released before they had played even a single show. They cut the album with engineer Nick Lloyd and formed a label with writer Alec Bemis, so those recordings could be released. Kerrang! magazine gave it four Ks, calling it ""the stuff underground legends are made of.""

The National made a second album, ""Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers"" (Brassland/Talitres 2003). The staff was the same, though Peter Katis, who produced ""Turn on The Bright Lights"" and ""Antics"" by Interpol, helped produce and mix, and Australian composer Padma Newsome from Clogs collaborated on arrangements and strings.

Following the first session of several for Bernard Lenoir on France's Radio Inter, an in-between EP was released, Cherry Tree, containing what would become the blueprint for the sound on their next record and the session of Sad Song's standout Murder Me Rachael. After these accolades and being impressed by their live show, Roger Trust signed them to Beggars Banquet.

A show at their favorite bar became a van ride to neighboring cities, became a plane ride to Europe, became two summers overseas. Their ties to those good jobs slackened. And they continue on their own path, moving out even further out in Brooklyn to Ditmas Park, where there is space and familiar suburban streets and even Geese on Beverly Road. Their album, ""Alligator"", much of which was recorded at their homes in Ditmas Park, was engineered by Paul Mahajan, who has worked with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and TV on the Radio. Padma Newsome camped out for a month with the band, and Peter Katis added more production and mixed the record at his house in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

Berninger's potent baritone still intones about matters fraught and funny and sad; about record collections, missing persons and medium-sized American hearts. But the record's not simply gothic or miserablist -- more like the plays of Tennessee Williams, it's full of peculiar intimacies and awkward grace. Alligator's heroes are reckless and possessed seducers, but they are apologetic ones. In The National's imaginings, in songs alternately lush and spare, there is something twighlit and dreamy worked out in the basement of our brains.

""Abel,"" ""Secret Meeting,"" and ""Lit Up"" were released as singles.

On May 22, 2007, The National released their follow-up to Alligator, Boxer, on Beggars Banquet. Taking advantage of the fact that nobody had heard their first album and earliest demos, Matt proceeded to steal lyrics and melodies from them and give them the attention they deserved while keeping the intimacy that made them special. They even managed to convince new friend Sufjan Stevens to lay down some piano tracks for them, and recorded the album in a scant 6 months after coming off the long post-Alligator road.

""Mistaken for Strangers"", ""Fake Empire"" and ""Apartment Story"" have been released as singles. The band have just finished touring North America and are on a large European autumn/winter tour after playing high slots at several large festivals. In their Dec. 07/Jan. 08 issue, Paste magazine named Boxer best record of 2007.

The band's fifth album, High Violet, was released on May 10, 2010 by 4AD Records. ""Bloodbuzz Ohio"", ""Anyone's Ghost"" and ""Terrible Love"" were released as singles.

In 2013 their sixth studio record Trouble Will Find Me was released and named ""Best New Music"" by Pitchfork. The album contained the single ""I Need My Girl"". In 2015, the album outtake ""Sunshine On My Back""  was released.

Four years after Trouble Will Find Me, marking the longest timespan between albums in their career so far, they released their seventh album Sleep Well Beast on September 8th, 2017 and were yet again met with great critical success.

78,ellie goulding,3344661,125508607,"Ellie Goulding (born Elena Jane Goulding, 30 December 1986 in Hereford, England) is an English singer-songwriter. Having caught the public's attention in 2010 with her singles ""Starry Eyed"" and ""Guns and Horses,"" British vocalist Ellie Goulding quickly rose to the top of the charts with her infectious electronic pop sound. Although she started out writing songs in a folk-inflected style, she eventually grew into a more electronic-influenced artist, touching upon dance music and ambient synth pop. With her unique soprano warble and knack for writing catchy yet emotionally earnest songs, Goulding, much like her predecessors Kate Bush and Imogen Heap, stands at the forefront of contemporary mainstream music and arty, independent-minded pop.

Born in Hereford, England, she later moved to the country's east coast to study drama at the University of Kent. Goulding had developed a love for folk music as a teenager, and her time at university also exposed her to electronica. After two years, she took a break from her studies and moved to West London, where she pursued a career as an alternative singer/songwriter and befriended producers like Starsmith and Frankmusik, who gave her songs an electro-pop twist. In 2009, Goulding began building an audience via the Internet, where early tracks like ""Starry Eyed"" and a cover of Sam Sparro's ""Black & Gold"" were posted on tastemaking MP3 blogs such as Discodust. Goulding soon graduated from the blogosphere to print media, gaining praise from mainstream publications like The Guardian and fielding offers from record labels. She ultimately signed a major-label deal with Polydor Records and began making preparations to release her debut album. In the meantime, she penned songs for Diana Vickers, Gabriella Climi, and others.

During the final weeks of 2009, Goulding topped the BBC's Sound of 2010, a poll conducted by British music critics and industry insiders to identify new talent. Building on that momentum, she released Lights -- a sparkling debut album that splashed Goulding's vocal flutter across a landscape of acoustic and synthesized instruments -- in March 2010. Lights topped the U.K. charts during its first week and spun off ""Starry Eyed"" as a Top Five single (it also charted well in Ireland and New Zealand). Later that year, the album was re-released as Bright Lights, featuring seven new recordings (including a cover of Elton John's ""Your Song,"" which peaked at number two).

In 2012, Goulding returned with her sophomore album, Halcyon, which showcased an even more sonically adventurous, electro-pop-infused sound. In 2013, a deluxe reissue featuring ten extra songs was released; entitled Halcyon Days, it acted as a supplement to the original release. Two of its new songs, ""Burn"" and ""How Long Will I Love You,"" were among her biggest hits. The following year, she was featured on Calvin Harris' Top Ten U.K. hit ""Outside,"" participated in Band Aid 30's update of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?,"" and entered the U.K. Top Ten once more with ""Beating Heart,"" a song released on the soundtrack for Divergent.

79,bon entendeur,145269,1852550,"From shared passions was born an extraordinary project: Bon Entendeur. A duo in love with French culture and curious to invent hybrid formats fed by their passions. The result: Aller-retour. A cluster of beautiful ideas gathered in a unique album. 

Their adventure starts with a rather classical approach: arranging playlists fed with music they like. They gradually added what would become their trademark: the grain of a personality's voice on mixed music. Their format is declined during 5 years, 40 mixtapes, more than 70 million listening. A quality signature. Bon Entendeur has this desire to talk about culture in its original version. This sense of aestheticism, of appropriateness. And of the stage. Behind the turntables, they mix their tributes and move the packed halls on a very fine sound. They also have the audacity to never run out of ideas, and in 2015 they offered their first revisit of a song from the 70s, Le temps est bon. A success.

Their album Aller-Retour concentrates their DNA: it is composed of revisited songs from the 60s and 70s and original productions mixed with interviews. All elegantly arranged in 14 tracks. Bon Entendeur creates sounds that are new, that go back and forth with their inventive digital generation and the immense heritage of their predecessors. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bon+Entendeur"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

80,andrew bird,1528822,58956579,"Andrew Bird (born July 11, 1973) is an American musician. He was born in Lake Bluff, Illinois but currently resides in the Los Angeles area. Bird is a singer, a violinist and, since 2004, a guitarist. He is also an accomplished whistler.

His early work, which echoed gypsy jazz and traditional folk, has led into his current sound, which mixes rock with more broad compositions. His years of solo song-craft have now enabled him to produce a sound that is uniquely his own.

Trained by the Suzuki method from a young age and a graduate of Illinois' Northwestern University, Bird released his first solo album, Music of Hair, in  1996. Vastly different from his later releases, this first album showcases his violin skills and pays tribute to his fascination with both American and European folk traditions, as well as jazz and blues.

His initial commercial exposure was in collaborative work with the band Squirrel Nut Zippers. He was quickly lumped in with the swing craze that swept the United States music industry in the mid '90s; this is an affiliation that he is still working to shed.

Taking on the role of band leader in 1997 with Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire, he released the album Thrills. This was followed by Oh! The Grandeur in 1998. Both albums were heavily influenced by traditional folk, pre-war jazz and swing, with Bird relying on the violin as his primary musical instrument.

In 2001, Bird released The Swimming Hour, his third release with the Bowl of Fire and a dramatic departure from previous recordings. The Swimming Hour featured a mixture of styles, from the zydeco-influenced ""Core and Rind"" to more straightforward rock songs. He has often referred to this record as his ""jukebox album"".

The Bowl of Fire unofficially disbanded some time in 2003, having featured many skilled Chicago musicians including Kevin O'Donnell, Nora O'Connor, Andy Hopkins (aka Mr. Rudy Day), Jimmy Sutton, Colin Bunn and Ryan Hembrey.

Bird then released two subsequent solo albums, both distributed through the label operated by Ani DiFranco, Righteous Babe Records. The two records, 2003's Weather Systems and 2005's The Mysterious Production of Eggs, continue a progression towards an eclectic indie folk sound that has proven challenging to classify.

Bird's live solo shows have been notable in that he uses a multi-track system to sample and loop his own performance. For example, he may record a snippet of his performance on violin, then play a ""loop"" of that sound. This provides a more full-bodied sound and aurally suggests a band performance, rather than the sound of a solo artist.

Bird's next full-length album Armchair Apocrypha (Fat Possum) was released on March 20th 2007.

November 2007 saw the Soldier On EP originally a European tour-only release. But due to high demand and unanticipated critical acclaim was released digitally and in CD-format on both sides of the Atlantic. Critics and fans alike have hearkened to the EP's first track, ""The Trees Were Mistaken"", a complex yet austere looping composition that marks a departure from Bird's earlier body of work. It also contains a cover of Bob Dylan's ""Oh Sister"".

January 2009 saw Noble Beast, also available with instrumental album Useless Creatures, released worldwide to positive reviews.

The Fatal Shore Songfacts reports that Break it Yourself, Bird's sixth solo studio album, was released on March 6, 2012 through Mom+Pop records in the US and Bella Union in the UK. The origins of the LP lie in a couple of jam sessions by a gathering of Bird's friends in the singer's western Illinois barn, near the banks of the Mississippi River.

Of his 2019 album My Finest Work Yet, Talia Schlanger of NPR says ""Bird zooms way out on humanity across history's timeline, seeking insight about our current age, in a way he hopes 'stays above the news feed noise.'""  Many tracks, including the opener ""Sisyphus,"" include Andrew's trademark whistling. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Bird"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

82,mxmtoon,846465,22062694,"Maia (born July 9, 2000) known professionally as mxmtoon is an American singer-songwriter and social media personality from Oakland, California. She is known for singing and playing the ukulele. Her 2018 self-released EP, plum blossom, recorded on her laptop in her parents' guest bedroom, has been streamed over 100 million times. In 2019, she played sold out tours and her debut album the masquerade was released in September.

Recording with GarageBand in her parents' guest bedroom, creating percussion tracks with hair straighteners, Maia began self-releasing songs on YouTube as ""mxmtoon"" in 2017. After initially attempting to write comedy songs, she began writing songs that embodied her emotions such as ""feelings are fatal"", which only required a USB microphone and GarageBand. The song currently has over 23 million streams on Spotify. Her 2017 collaboration with Japanese lo-fi producer peachy!, ""Falling for U"", reached nearly 40 million streams on Spotify by June 2019. Maia began secretly releasing music to the public, but was later compelled to tell her friends and family after experiencing viral success online. In 2018, Maia released her debut EP, plum blossom, which was reviewed by Earmilk, i-D and Hypebeast, and gained more than 100 million streams on Spotify by August 2019. The EP's single ""i feel like chet"" is a tribute to one of her favorite jazz musicians, Chet Baker.

After high school, Maia took a ""gap year"" by postponing college to focus on her music. She was planning to study architecture after graduating high school, until her music went viral in April 2018. In November 2018, she announced her ""plum blossom tour"". Her first tour, initially scheduled for five US shows with fellow Californian singer-songwriter khai dreams in March 2019, sold out, and was extended to include additional concerts in North America and Europe, including opening appearances for bedroom pop YouTuber Cavetown in the United Kingdom. Maia made her first appearance on a billboard in Times Square when Spotify advertised her single ""dream of you"" for their New Music Friday playlist.

Prior to the release of the masquerade, Spotify announced the release of 21 Days, a music podcast that follows Maia while she works on the album in New York City. Liz Gateley of Spotify praised Maia's online following as well as her social presence, stating that ""She obviously has lots of followers already, but that's not enough. The person had to be the right human too, and we felt she had both."" The podcast is an eight-episode audio diary that includes interviews with family, friends and collaborators, including the album's producer Cavetown.

Maia's debut studio album the masquerade was released on September 17, 2019. The album peaked at 17 on the US Heatseekers Chart and at 45 on the US Indie Albums Chart. It features ""prom dress"", a ""light and peachy tune"" described as ""relatable, infectious hook-led pop that speaks to millennials"". The single is inspired by experiences from her own big night and deals with social anxiety and the problems that come with being a teen in modern society. The song has been streamed over 30 million times on Spotify, and has been used in 100,000 videos on TikTok. Maia's back catalogue of songs have also received tens of millions of online streams.

Joshua Bote of Paste described the ten-track album as ""comforting twee-pop that wrings out genuine pathos from mxmtoon’s internet celebrity"". Matt Yuyitung of Exclaim! wrote ""[Maia] brings her wry sense of humour and diary-entry lyricism to her debut record, recalling the lo-fi relatability of Frankie Cosmos.""

Maia embarked on her sold out ""the masquerade Tour"" of North America and United Kingdom in September 2019. She released her first graphic novel ""The Adventures Of Mxmtoon: The Masquerade"" in October 2019. Kirsten Spruch from Billboard wrote, ""The novel seamlessly pairs with the album, encapsulating her introverted, teenage tendencies and free-flowing creativity."" Gabe Bergado from Teen Vogue described the book ""a captivating, charming visual journey that complements the dreamy album."" She released an accompanying animated short film for the graphic novel in November 2019.

In November 2019, Maia announced via Twitter that she would be joining American singer-songwriter Lauv for his 2020 summer tour of Asia supporting his album how i'm feeling.

On November 19, 2019, Kobalt Music Group announced that they would be signing mxmtoon to their label under a global publishing deal. This deal will include administration and creative support for current music catalogue and future works. Creative Vice-President at Kobalt, Melissa Emert-Hutner, stated ""Maia is truly the voice of her generation; by sharing her beautiful, heartfelt music with the world and growing her brand organically, she exemplifies the DIY spirit and aesthetic that Kobalt embraces."" Emily Bines, a senior creative director at Kobalt added ""Mxmtoon is exactly the type of forward-thinking creative that we dream about working with at Kobalt. Her vision, matched with her team’s passion to bring it to fruition is unwavering. We will be hearing from Maia for a long time to come.""

Maia released the masquerade (the edits) on November 22, 2019. The EP features remixes from songs on the masquerade from names like Chloe Lilac, Alexander 23 and Chloe Moriondo. In November 2019, Dork put Maia on their Hype List of 2020, alongside names like girl in red, Beabadoobee and Maisie Peters.

In December 2019, Maia re-recorded the song ""prom dress"" in Simlish, the fictional language used in The Sims games, to help promotion. The Simlish version was added to The Sims 4 on December 12, 2019. Maia reacted on Twitter with ""countless hours of playing the sims has helped me become fluent in simlish... and guess what?? prom dress was just added to #thesims4 today!"" A week later Maia released the music video for ""unspoken words"", which revolves around her Chinese-American upbringing as well as her relationship with her Chinese grandmother.

89,maribou state,535966,11408405,"Maribou State is Chris Davids and Liam Ivory from Hertfordshire. Liam asked Chris to play bass for his band. When they moved up north to go to university, the band fell by the wayside and the pair began making electronic music in their home studio, forging a partnership that would soon become Maribou State.

In the summer of 2011 they were scouted by Fat! Records and put out their debut release, the 'Olivia' EP, which set a blueprint for Maribou State's trademark bass-heavy, melodic sound. Grassroots support for the duo was also building. When they brought out a bootleg of Lauryn Hill's 'Doo Wop' (produced in collaboration with Pedestrian), the tune racked up thousands of plays on YouTube and got airtime on Radio 1, 1Xtra and XFM courtesy of Diplo, B. Traits and Eddy Temple Morris respectively.

Their first project for Southern Fried was a remix of 'Hummus' by Crookers, which hit the top of the Hype Machine chart during the spring of 2012. Then the 'Native' EP dropped in June and one of the tracks from it, 'The Look', was promptly given 10/10 and awarded Tune Of The Month by Mixmag. Along with underground fans, key tastemakers were beginning to take note.

Momentum continued when, after a summer spent playing shows, the next single for Southern Fried was released. 'Scarlett Groove' (featuring Saint Saviour) was a certified off-kilter pop hit, notching up radio play from Annie Mac and Lauren Laverne as well as being given Essential Tune status by Pete Tong. It was an excellent way to round off 2012, a year made all the nicer when Maribou State's remix of Ultraista's 'Gold Dayzz' went viral, plonking the pair at the top of the Hype Machine chart once again and hitting over 200,000 plays on SoundCloud.

Their first major release of this year was another collaboration with Pedestrian. Signed by Polish house duo Catz 'N Dogz and put out via their Pets imprint, 'Mask' pushed Maribou State firmly to the fore of the British scene, running alongside Disclosure, Bondax and AlunaGeorge as artists dedicated to making accessible yet highly inventive dance music. The record also gained further radio play from Zane Lowe, Hugh Stephens and Rob Da Bank, as well as long-time supporters Annie Mac, B. Traits and Pete Tong.

As 2013 began to unfurl, Chris and Liam will release their latest single for Southern Fried, a record that marks the next stage of their career. A double-A side including 'Tongue' and 'Larks Rise', it sees them realise their vision of creating organic dance music in the same kind of way as Bonobo and Four Tet, forging field recordings and live instrumentation with broken house rhythms and waves of sub-bass.

95,lykke li,2696228,81949061,"Li Lykke Timotej Zachrisson (born on March 18, 1986) is a Swedish singer, songwriter and model from Stockholm. She is known for her blend of indie pop, dream pop, and electronic music. She grew up in a creatively and musically supportive environment; her mother, Kärsti Stiege, was a photographer and former member of the band Tant Strul, while her father, Johan Zachrisson, was a musician in the Swedish reggae/progg band Dag Vag. Her brother, Zacharias Zachrisson, also pursued a music career. The family moved frequently, living in Stockholm, Portugal, Nepal, and India, which exposed her to a variety of cultural and musical influences from a young age. These experiences would later inform her music style and creative outlook.

At 19, Lykke Li spent several months in Brooklyn, New York, immersing herself in the local music scene before returning to Sweden. She went back to Brooklyn two years later at age 21 to record her debut album, Youth Novels, which was released in Sweden on January 30, 2008. Produced by Björn Yttling of the band Peter Bjorn and John along with Lasse Mårtén, Youth Novels gained international acclaim for its confessional lyrics and minimalistic production. It was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland in June 2008 and in the United States on August 19. Her single ""Little Bit"" from the album captured widespread attention, gaining praise from the indie community and the music site Stereogum, which described her style as a blend of soul, electro, and “powdered-sugar pop.”

Building on the success of her debut, Lykke Li continued to release music that explored themes of love, heartache, and introspection. Her follow-up albums, Wounded Rhymes in 2011 and I Never Learn in 2014, showcased a more mature, emotionally charged sound, with Wounded Rhymes earning her two Swedish Grammy Awards for Artist of the Year and Album of the Year in 2012. Alongside her solo career, she collaborated with prominent artists like Kleerup and Röyksopp, lending her vocals to the tracks ""Until We Bleed,"" ""Miss It So Much,"" and ""Were You Ever Wanted."" Her growing popularity led to notable appearances on shows like Conan and Skavlan in early 2011, helping her reach an even broader audience.

In 2016, Lykke Li co-founded the band LIV alongside members of Miike Snow and Peter Bjorn and John, further expanding her creative pursuits. Two years later, she released her fourth album, So Sad So Sexy (2018), marking a shift towards a more mainstream pop sound infused with late-2010s production influences. Her 2022 album, Eyeye, saw her return to a more introspective and sonically experimental approach, once again showcasing her characteristic blend of melancholic lyrics and innovative production. Over her career, Lykke Li has built a reputation for her sensuous, ethereal vocals and innovative musical style, solidifying her place as a significant figure in contemporary indie pop and electronic music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lykke+Li"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Esteman has been developing his interest in music since the age of 12, as he attended several music and theatre academies, acting classes and college education in Electronic Media Arts. At a prodigiously young age Esteman started writing songs and school plays involving musical theatre for his elementary school and ever since, writing and performing has become one of his favorites activities. Later on, while he was in college, Esteman decided to pursue his music career full-time, he found in music a perfect space where he was able to focus in his main interest: music.
This is how Esteman's musical project begins, mixing styles and influences in order to build catchy melodies loaded with irony, where the plastic sounds of a synthesizer get together with percussion elements both usual and inusual, saxophones and old school guitars as we can hear in his first single ""No te metas a mi Facebook"" which translates ""Dont bother me on Facebook"".

With a careful fusion of elements where you can find eclectic pop, disco music, indie-pop, the most thought provoking lyrics and choreography, Esteman's project gets launched in the latin pop market with a musical, visual and performative proposal that will make you vibrate until the end of this song.

1) D'Angelo (born Michael Eugene Archer on 11 February 1974 in Richmond, VA, United States) is a neo-soul singer, keyboardist, and guitarist. He has released three albums, ""Brown Sugar"" (1995), ""Voodoo"" (2000), and ""Black Messiah"" as D'Angelo and the Vanguard (2014).

D'Angelo signed a publishing deal with EMI Music in 1991 after catching the attention of record executives with a demo tape. He penned the hit song ""U Will Know"" on the Jason's Lyric soundtrack. It was performed by Black Men United for the Jason's Lyric motion picture soundtrack. Shortly after, he was signed by Gary Harris and he began recording his debut album for EMI records.

Brown Sugar was released in June 1995. Though sales were sluggish at first, the album was eventually a hit, due in large part to ""Lady,"" a Top Ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, peaking at #10. The album earned platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America, following sales in excess of one million copies in the U.S., while its total sales have been estimated within the range of 1.5 million to over two million copies. The album helped give commercial visibility to the burgeoning neo soul movement of the 1990s, along with debut albums by Maxwell, Erykah Badu, and Lauryn Hill. The album was a critical success as well, and appeared on many critics' ""best of"" lists for the year.

Following his debut album's success, D'Angelo went into a four and a half year absence from the music scene and releasing solo work. His recordings for soundtracks included Belly (""Devil's Pie""), frequently singing covers like ""Girl You Need a Change of Mind"" (Eddie Kendricks, Get on the Bus), ""She's Always in My Hair"" (Prince, Scream 2) and ""Heaven Must Be Like This"" (The Ohio Players, Down in the Delta), as well as appearing on Lauryn Hill's landmark The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill on the duet ""Nothing Even Matters"".

The much-delayed follow-up to Brown Sugar, Voodoo, was finally released in 2000. It debuted at #1 and went on to win two Grammy Awards, one for Best R&B Album, and the other for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance. The lead single, 1999's ""Left & Right"" (featuring Method Man and Redman) did well, but it was the second single, ""Untitled (How Does It Feel)"" (a tribute to artist Prince), that became a huge R&B hit buoyed by an innovative yet infamous video featuring a nude D'Angelo from his face to his hips while singing the song. The video was nominated for 4 MTV Video Music Awards and currently ranks #44 in VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Videos. He also performed ""Be Here"" (with Raphael Saadiq) from Saadiq's album Instant Vintage.

After the release D'Angelo embarked on what would become one of the most fabled series of live soul shows in history, ""The Voodoo Tour."" Consisting of a live group entitled ""the Soultronics,"" (presumed to have been assembled by Ahmir ""Questlove"" Thompson of The Roots) which engulfed arena-size stages with various dancers and instrument players, it was one of the most attended shows of the year. The tour was taken all around the world, one of the most notable performances being the Free Jazz Festival in Brazil. The live show was a thinly-disguised homage to Prince's late 80's shows, in its grandeur and conceptual stage set-up & setlist. Slum Village (then in its original line-up of Jay Dee, Baatin & T3) opened for D'Angelo on several dates, and soul-tinged R&B singer Anthony Hamilton sang backup in the band.

In 2002, Q magazine named him in their list of the ""50 Bands To See Before You Die"", and in 2003 Voodoo was ranked at number 488 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Pitchfork Media rated it at #44 on their list of the best albums of the 2000s.

113,bon iver,3156795,194092555,"
Bon Iver is a Grammy Award winning  folk band from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, United States, and one of Justin Vernon's current and most notable music projects to date. The band also consists of Mike Noyce, Sean Carey and Matt MacCaughan. 

The name 'Bon Iver' (pronounced ""bon ee-VAIR"") is a play on the French phrase 'bon hiver' meaning 'good winter'. Vernon independently released Bon Iver's debut album For Emma, Forever Ago in 2007, most of which was recorded during a four-month stay in a remote cabin in Wisconsin.

While in high school and college Vernon founded the indie-rock bands Mount Vernon and DeYarmond Edison in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, where he still resides.

According to the For Emma Songfacts, after the break-up of De Yarmond Edison, Vernon retreated to his father's log cabin, out in the woods of north-east Wisconsin to hibernate for three snowy months. There he collected his thoughts and formulated them into a suite of songs,  For Emma, Forever Ago . The album was originally self-released in late 2007 in a run of 500 copies and sold out instantly. 

The album garnered critical acclaim, and was picked up by the indie-rock label Jagjaguwar, which gave the album a proper release on February 19th, 2008. The album was released in the UK and Europe by iconic indie 4AD on May 12, 2008.

When released in the UK, For Emma, Forever Ago received 5/5 and ""Album of the Month"" reviews in both MOJO and Uncut magazines. It is currently the third highest rated album of 2008 on review-aggregator site Metacritic, with accolades from publications including The Village Voice, The Hartford Courant and The A.V. Club.

The group's second album Bon Iver, Bon Iver was released on June 17, 2011 to universal acclaim. It was named by Pitchfork Media as the best album of 2011 on their annual list. At the 2012 Grammys, the album won Best Alternative Album and the group was awarded Best New Artist, despite having debuted in 2007.

126,matt corby,415862,6002592,"Matthew John ""Matt"" Corby (born 7 November 1990, Australia) is an Australian singer songwriter.

Matt Corby has certainly carved a unique path for someone that started his career aged 16 on a reality TV talent show in 2007. In 2009, he independently released his debut EP 'Song For...' before relocating to London and signing with renowned UK indie label Communion after capturing the attention of the label's owner; Ben Lovett of Mumford and Sons fame.

Matt Corby’s songs and vocals elicit a sensation that is nothing short of captivating. Having previously been compared to legendary artists such as Nick Drake and Jeff Buckley, Matt’s songs continue to deliver a uniqueness and maturity well beyond his years while his live performances have become renowned for bringing large audiences to a complete stand still.

After recording with Ian Grimble (The Libertines, Seasick Steve) and releasing his hauntingly beautiful EP 'Transition To Colour' in late 2010, Matt has been busy engaging audiences with his live shows. Matt spent the earlier part of 2011 playing sold out shows in London and showcasing at SXSW in Austin, Texas in February before coming back to Australia to play a string of intimate “Secret Garden” shows in fans’ backyards. He soon after joined UK band Elbow as the main support on their national tour of sold out Splendour sideshows in July.

On 1 October 2015, Matt released his first song in two years, 'Monday' from his debut album, 'Telluric'. The song was described as containing ""lush, transcendent harmonies, wailing falsetto, folky boom-claps and heartbreaking lyrics"", and later voted 53 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2015. 'Telluric' was eventually released on 11 March 2016.

On 7 September 2018, Matt announced his 2nd studio album 'Rainbow Valley', released 2 November 2018.

Personally, Matt enjoys surfing and reading, and became a father with his first child in early 2018.

129,men i trust,1716355,86337351,"Men I Trust is Dragos, Emma, Jessy, Mathieu and Alexis. Founded in 2014, the indie dance band from Montreal, Canada loves smooth sounds, calm melodies and simple rhythms that relax, but make your right foot tap and your chin bounce on the beats. They record, mix, master and shoot their music videos. 

Jessy and Dragos knew each other since their fourth year of high school. Back then (mid-2000’s), Dragos had somewhat of a background in classical piano and Jessy mastered the dark and esoteric art of the metal guitar solist.

In 2012, while finishing his master’s degree in audio postproduction at Laval University, Dragos spent most of his days and sleeping hours at the “LARC” studio working on his solo projects. He randomly met Jessy again, who was finishing his bachelor degree in Jazz guitar, in one of the faculty’s hallways and talked about doing a French-Touch / Italo-Disco track together. Some weeks later, they did just that. And it worked out so well that they decided to extend their collaboration to a whole project where many singers such as Odile Marmet-Rochefort, Gabrielle Shonk, Helena Deland and Geoffroy Sauvé, would be involved.

Between 2012 and 2016, all of Jessy’s and Dragos’ releases were made as part of Dragos’ masters and (dropped) PhD studies in order to gain access to the LARC’s infrastructure and to develop a unique sound.


Emma was a fortuitous encounter. In 2015 a mutual friend presented her to Dragos through a video posted over the Internet. She was casually singing and playing the guitar around a campfire with some of her friends. Emma’s voice was different, being less clear, more grainy and fragile with a mysterious twist that caught their attention. They reached her and tried recording one song called “Out in myself”, which turned to be one of the band’s easiest to record.

Jessy and Dragos then invited her to join them on live shows with Odile at the beginning of 2015. The womans' voices blended wonderfully together and the band got lots of positive feedback from the experience. Emma has been part of Men I Trust since then.

With their second album “Headroom"", Men I Trust truly became a trio. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Men+I+Trust"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
130,cocoon,272139,4527296,"There are at least six bands called Cocoon:

1. Cocoon is a two-piece French band formed in 2006 by Mark Daumail (born 1984, composition, lead vocals, acoustic guitar, ukelele, banjo, beatbox, etc.) and Morgane Imbeaud (born 1987, vocal harmonies, keyboards, arrangements).

""I wanted it to be a male-female duet. A duo like the White Stripes are in rock — we wanted to be the equivalent in folk music,"" Daumail says. Their songs are entirely sung in English. ""French artists singing in English isn't something new. It goes back to groups like Les Thugs and Syd Matters,"" he remarks.

Daumail says he's always been interested in folk music: ""Basically, Cocoon's musical inspiration goes all the way from groups like The Pentangle and Fairport Convention right through to the 'new folk' movement that surfaced around the beginning of 2000 with artists like CocoRosie, Devendra Banhart and Sufjan Stevens.""

In 2006, the pop / folk duet released its first EP, entitled I Hate Birds, and won the 2006 edition of the Big Jama regional contest. The following year, Cocoon was signed onto the French indie label Sober & Gentle. The band released a second EP, From Panda Mountains, followed by their first album, entitled My Friends All Died in a Plane Crash. The group won the CQFD music contest organized by the French magazine Les Inrockuptibles and performed in the new talent section of the rock music festivals Le Printemps de Bourges and Les Eurockéennes de Belfort.

2. Cocoon is a solo project by one of the founding members of the French group Clair Obscur which was one of the first groups in the 80's in France to work across music, visual arts, dance and theatre. Clair Obscur was one of the very few bands of the French cold wave/industrial scene which became known abroad with its records released by the British labels Cathexis, All the Madmen and NER (compilation From Torture to Conscience with Current 93, In the Nursery, Death in June, etc). 

Christophe Demarthe has been working for many years at the frontier of sound and visual arts. He has created sound architectures for theatre, dance, cinema, visual arts, radio... mainly working with the drama producer Bruno Lajara (501 Blues, Ne Pas, Fuites, Après Coups, Léon le Nul...) and with Jean Couturier for radio dramas on France Culture. He has written music for the cinema and for television (France 2, Canal Plus). 

In 2004 he created Cocoon, releasing his debut album on the French label Optical Sound. Much more than a mere sound object based on an album concept, Cocoon can be read as a global artistic project close to the performance. It is an audio set accompanied by videos and asking for an active participation of the public, banishing the passive listening of laptoppers. The stage disposition creates a real contrast with the characteristic immobility of electronic music concerts, and definitively places itself at the crossing point of image, sound and live show, for a moving interdisciplinarity. 

Since its creation in 2004, Cocoon has participated in the festivals Nowa Fabryka (Bytom, Poland), Emergences/Villette Numérique (Paris), Nuit Blanche (Paris), Emo-Son (Bourges), Salon Light (Paris)... He has been reviewed in Libération, on Arte-TV.com, in the magazines Mouvement, Télérama, The Wire, on France Culture... His second album, More Violent Days Are to Come (OS.012) (Optical Sound), has been nominated for the Qwartz Electronic Music Awards 2006/2007.

133,alex ferreira,54207,675999,"Alex Ferreira was born in Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) on March 23, 1983. He spent his childhood and adolescence between New York, Miami and Santo Domingo. He began playing guitar and writing songs at 16 years of age.

The Britpop of the 90s, 60s folk, Argentinean rock, boleros and Cuban trova, is a mere sum of its influences. He began playing professionally in the Dominican famous cultural center ""Casa de Teatro"" as well as other bars in the Colonial Zone of Santo Domingo. Sometimes accompanied by his band and many times just with his guitar, there he released his first songs. He recorded his first demos and quickly made himself known in the music scene of his country. There also, he shared the stage with great Dominican singers as Víctor Víctor, Luis Dias, José Antonio Rodríguez, among others.

During the spring of 2005 he released his self-produced and self-published (limited only to 250 copies) first album entitled ""Parto Mi Viaje."" For this album, some of the country's leading musicians collaborated with him. Singles from this album such as ""Rienda Suelta"", ""Siete sin suerte"" and ""Uno más aquí"", were widely played in Santo Domingo's rock stations. He also released demos as ""Zigzag"" and ""Pixel"" which also reached the first positions in the lists of stations in the country. That same year, Alex won the prestigious music competition in ""Casa de Teatro"" in 2 different categories (pop and rock). And is nominated, at the Dominican Republic's Casandra Awards for Best Rock Group of the Year.

Later that year he decided to abandon his studies of ""Advertising Communication"" and travels to Spain to study a ""Degree in Recording Arts"" for three years. His primary purpose for this trip was to form a band and appear on stage. Since then, resides there. The idea to form a band, never took shape and Alex decided to stick with his solo project.

The ""underground scene"" of Madrid welcomes him as one of theirs. Playing in bars in the center and then in theaters of high caliber. After recording several demos in the city of Madrid in 2006, trying different lineups in his band, traveling in Spain small gigging, and writing songs, he decided to record in the summer of 2007, the acoustic EP ""Un Domingo Cualquiera"", produced by David Quinzán and Ferreira himself and recorded in Aristi Studios in Madrid. In this work he shows his maturity as a songwriter and in it, Spanish musicians played with him. This EP was placed on his website, after signing a publishing contract with EMI Music Publishing Spain. After a year of concerts in Spain, he eventually signed a recording contract in 2008 with Warner/DRO Music Spain. That same year he published ""Serenata de Plástico"", an EP containing 5 songs. He shared stage with known Spanish pop artists ranging from Iván Ferreiro to Kiko Veneno. ""Casa América"" and ""Latin Fusion"" magazines name him among the 100 most influential Latinos in 2008. In April 2009 Warner/DRO released ""Páginas"", another EP of 5 songs. His name began to appear on posters for national festivals, between the biggest names in modern Spanish pop. In January 2010, he published his first full-length album entitled ""Un Domingo Cualquiera"" appointed by Radio 3 as one of the most anticipated albums of the year.

134,patrick watson,1394429,28515679,"Patrick Watson (born 1979 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, whose blend of cabaret pop and classical music influences with indie rock has been compared to Rufus Wainwright, Jeff Buckley and Andrew Bird.

Singing in the local church choirs as a boy, studying jazz and classical piano performance, composition, and arrangement, and singing and playing keyboards in the ska band Gangster Politics in high school. Watson left the band after graduating and began to explore other types of music, including electronica and ambient. In 2002, after returning from a trip to Vietnam, he decided to start a four-piece chamber pop group, bringing in bassist Mishka Stein, drummer Robbie Kuster (both of whom he had met at university), and former Gangster Politics guitarist Simon Angell. The group (which was technically a solo project with a backing band) released Just Another Ordinary Day (2003) independently.

In 2001 Watson released his first own solo debut, Waterproof9 and in 2006 his second, Close to Paradise. Early in 2007, Watson was nominated for a Juno Canada's music award in the New Artist of the Year category.

His band's song ""The Great Escape"" was featured on a third-season episode of Grey's Anatomy.

He co-wrote and performed on several songs on The Cinematic Orchestra's 2007 album Ma Fleur including the opening track ""To Build a Home"". His ""Missing You"" remix of Champion's ""Guy Doune"", from Champion's 2006 album The Remix Album, reached #1 on CBC Radio 3's R3-30 chart in early 2007.

Patrick Watson (the band) also won the prestigeous Polaris Music Prize (Canada) in 2007.

135,charlie cunningham,268310,3418551,"Charlie Cunningham is an English singer-songwriter based in Oxford.

Cunningham is a fresh talent, proving to be more than just a man with a guitar and a voice; a regularity that we have become all too familiar with. His new and ambitious EP Outside Things combines beautiful, yet honest song-writing with such percussive guitar playing that he truly stands out from the crowd.

Title track “Outside Things’” premièred on Best Fit; the lyrics are from the perspective of a newly-born baby. It’s a time that occurs in everyone’s life that cannot be remembered or recalled, this therefore, explorative aspect to his song-writing shows the depth Cunningham has to offer, unlike so many artists of his type. The song manages to convey an impression of diving in and out from the confusion of that foreign experience in such a compelling nature, accompanied by intense vocals playing on the track’s intimacy. “Outside Things’” carries with it a strange sense of longing, which is continuous throughout the EP.

“In One Out” is the first track to be heard on the record; it’s melodic, but profoundly sombre and relatively dark sounding. The finger-picked guitar behind the vocals is hypnotic. There’s a slight step away from this intensity of the opening track and that of the title track in “Lights Off” and “Plans” - the second and fourth tracks on the EP. With far less movement there’s time to breathe between songs, it really helps to make each one stand out in their own right. During both of these tracks Cunningham creates moments of silence, with constant breaks where everything comes to a brief halt – if you heard these tracks live you’d want to be situated in an intimate and silent setting.

The Outside Things EP not only demonstrates Cunningham’s impeccable writing ability, but his intricate and skilful playing technique, developed and picked up from his time spent in Seville, along with showing off his individual voice. Through the EP Cunningham’s percussive, yet flexible guitars playing technique is something to be whole heartedly admired. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Cunningham"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

That's when Miel de Montagne arrived with his songs and his guitar. A young man of 23 who decides to leave Paris to live with his parents in the countryside. A way to get away from the fantasy of a fast-paced life that he doesn't really like. 

On electronic and pop-tinged prods, he now sings about the simple life, the love for girls and for his lifelong dog. Often with very short sentences that come back endlessly like a ritornello. 

Funny coming from the son of Marcel Kanche, lyricist for Mathieu Chedid, Vanessa Paradis or Axel Bauer. And at the end of the day, if Milan hears his mother singing what has escaped from the studio, for him the song is validated.

139,fruit bats,571860,8376216,"Fruit Bats is an American indie-rock band formed in 1997 in Chicago, Illinois. The group has had many personnel changes but revolves around songwriter Eric D. Johnson. Their albums include Echolocation (2001), Mouthfuls (2003), Spelled in Bones (2005), The Ruminant Band (2009), Tripper (2011), and Absolute Loser (2016). In 2009 Johnson also joined The Shins.

Originally part of short-lived Chicago group I Rowboat, Johnson and two of his fellow Rowboat members, guitarist Dan Strack and drummer Brian Belval, created Fruit Bats as a side-project. When I Rowboat split up, Fruit Bats became Johnson's main focus. Spurred on by Califone/Perishable Records honchos Tim Rutili and Ben Massarella, the group recorded their first album, Echolocation, released in 2001.

After tours with Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, Modest Mouse and The Shins, Fruit Bats signed with Sub Pop in late summer 2002, recording their second album, 2003's Mouthfuls, which included new bandmate Gillian Lisee.

After relocating to Seattle, the group released their third album, Spelled in Bones, in 2005. Afterward, Eric D. Johnson played with The Shins and Vetiver. In 2008, the Fruit Bats began working together again, with revised membership of Johnson, Christopher Sherman, Ron Lewis, Graeme Gibson, and Sam Wagster. In 2009, they released The Ruminant Band and in 2011 came Tripper. 

In November 2013, Eric D. Johnson announced he would be dissolving Fruit Bats. That month they played what was to be their farewell show at a sold out Aladdin Theatre in Portland, OR. The following year Johnson released an album under the name EDJ. 

Reforming in 2015, Fruit Bats released their sixth official full-length LP, Absolute Loser, in 2016 via newly formed Los Angeles-based label Easy Sound. 

Fruit Bats signed to North Carolina-based independent label Merge Records in 2018. Also in 2018, Johnson formed the folk group Bonny Light Horseman with Josh Kaufman and Anais Mitchell. 

In 2019 Fruit Bats’ Merge debut ""Gold Past Life"" was released. 

Fruit Bats’ 2020 album The Pet Parade was produced by Johnson's Bonny Light Horseman bandmate Josh Kaufman. 

In 2021, Fruit Bats released a full-album cover of Smashing Pumpkins' 1993 record Siamese Dream.

141,tyler childers,447920,25491143,"Tyler Childers (born June 21, 1991) is an American singer and songwriter. His music is a mix of country, bluegrass and folk. He released his breakthrough album Purgatory in August 2017. Childers released his third and most recent LP, Country Squire, via his own Hickman Holler Records, under exclusive license to RCA Records in August 2019. 

Tyler Childers was born and raised in Lawrence County, Kentucky. His father worked in the coal industry and his mother is a nurse. He learned singing in church where he sang in the church choir. He started to play guitar and write songs when he was around 13. He moved from Lawrence County to Paintsville, Kentucky, where he attended Paintsville High School and graduated in 2009. Fellow country musicians Chris Stapleton and Loretta Lynn (Van Lear, KY) also hail from Paintsville. He studied for a semester at Western Kentucky University, and enrolled at Bluegrass Community and Technical College for a few semesters. He dropped out of college and did odd jobs for some time while pursuing a music career.

Childers began performing in Lexington, Kentucky and Huntington, West Virginia. In 2011, when he was 19, Childers released his first album, Bottles And Bibles. He has also released two EPs recorded in 2013 at Red Barn Radio, a radio show from Lexington. The two EPs were later released as one after the success of his album Purgatory, and reached No. 5 on Heatseekers Albums.

He had his first success with Purgatory, a breakthrough album released on August 4, 2017. The album was produced by Sturgill Simpson and David Ferguson and recorded at The Butcher Shoppe in Nashville. Simpson also played guitar and sang backing vocals on the album, with Miles Miller on drums, Stuart Duncan on fiddle and Russ Paul on other instruments. It debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums chart, No. 17 on the Country albums chart and No. 4 on the Americana/Folk albums chart. In September 2018, Childers won Emerging Artist of the Year at the 2018 Americana Music Honors & Awards, where he gave an acceptance speech noted for its criticism of the Americana genre label, saying that ""as a man who identifies as a country music singer, I feel Americana ain't no part of nothing and is a distraction from the issues that we're facing on a bigger level as country music singers. It kind of feels like purgatory.""

Country Squire, a second album under the Hickman Holler label, and Childers' third overall, was released on August 2, 2019, after being announced in May 2019. This album was again produced by Simpson and Ferguson. The video of the lead single from the album ""House Fire"" was also released on May 16, 2019.

Childers' music is influenced by his home state of Kentucky and its connection to country music and bluegrass. He often writes about coal mining, which was his father's occupation, and its effects. Rebecca Bengal, writing for The Guardian, described Childers' songs as a ""counternarrative to the outsiders who seek to perpetuate stereotypes of backwardness and poverty."" Childers emphasizes lyrical content in songs, comparing the songwriting process to telling short stories. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tyler+Childers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

143,metronomy,1410361,53062037,"Metronomy is an electropop group which formed in 1999 in Totnes, Devon, United Kingdom, originally as the solo project of Joseph Mount. The project later expanded into a full band, which currently consists of Joseph Mount (vocals, keyboards, guitar), Oscar Cash (keyboards, saxophone, vocals), Gbenga Adelekan (bass, vocals) and Anna Prior (drums, vocals). The band has released five albums: ""Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe)"" (2006), ""Nights Out"" (2008), ""The English Riviera"" (2011), ""Love Letters"" (2014) and ""Summer 08"" (2016).

Metronomy began in the tiny, bohemian market town of Totnes, Devon, when Joseph’s Dad sold his son a computer so he could sit in his bedroom and make electronic music. He was inspired by the likes of Autechre, LFO and Aphex Twin, more as a creative hobby than a pop masterplan.

After decamping to Brighton for Uni, Metronomy released their debut album in June 2006. It was called Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe), and its obtuse but fascinating, largely instrumental electro-pop reflected the eccentricity of its title, and the enduring influence of Totnes.

Joseph admits that he only, finally, saw the commercial possibilities of Metronomy when DJ, producer, Trash founder and electro-punk avatar Erol Alkan began to feature the single You Could Easily Have Me in his sets, and asked Metronomy to play at his club. Cue the need for a proper live show, and the additions of Gabriel Stebbing, Oscar Cash, dance routines and clothes that blink. 

Move on 2 years and Nights Out a wonky love-child of Giorgio Moroder, New Order, Pet Shop Boys and Unfinished Sympathy is a second album that feels like a debut. The first to be vocal-led, with the self-effacing Joseph stepping up and grabbing the mic for most of the tracks; and, crucially, the first to introduce Metronomy as a fully live propsition, rather than a pseudonym for Joseph‘s solo work. 

As Metronomy’s busy touring schedule built a buzz amongst kids who instinctively get the dance/art crossover, In April 2009 the Metronomy show took another leap in its evolution, with the addition for the first time of a live drummer in Anna Prior, and bassist Gbenga Adelekan. The new Metronomy was completely live, proving it is possible for electronic bands to put on show as authentic as any rock band. 

Meanwhile Joseph has embarked on a series of prestigious remixes for the likes of Klaxons, Franz Ferdinand, Gorillaz and collaborations with Kate Nash and Florence and The Machine.

146,joy williams,290846,2096548,"Joy Williams (born Joy Elizabeth Williams on November 14, 1982) is an American singer-songwriter. The winner of four Grammy Awards, Williams released her self-titled debut in 2001. She was half of The Civil Wars duo from 2009 until 2014.

Williams grew up in Santa Cruz, CA. At 17, she signed a recording contract with PLG/SonyBMG and moved to the friendly, muggy town of Nashville, TN. She co-wrote and recorded several albums and realized after 7 years of being on the road full time that it was song-writing that kept tugging at her heart. Williams is now signed as a full-time writer with Judy Stakee at Warner/Chappell in LA and is with ASCAP. She writes for various projects daily with a team of very talented people from around the globe. She has the chance to work with American Idol finalists, rock bands, pop acts, indie artists, tv/film projects, CCM, country and more. Williams has also recently formed a new record label with her husband Nate Yetton, called Sensibility Music LLC, to facilitate recording and releasing new Joy Williams music in the future.

Since starting Sensibility Music Williams has had several of her songs featured prominently in hit TV shows.  ""Charmed Life"", ""Speaking a Dead Language"" and ""Sunny Day"" have been in episodes of the hit ABC drama Grey's Anatomy; ""If You Wanna Go"" and ""One of Those Days"" in Lifetime's breakout drama Drop Dead Diva; ""Sunny Day"" in the CW's 90210,  and ""tightrope"" was featured on The WB's ""One Tree Hill"". 

In 2010 Oscar Mayer settled on  Doesn't Get Better Than This from Joy to be their new add campaign song. According to Mayers ""[Joy] wrote what ended up being the tag line for the whole campaign, “It doesn’t get better than this.”

In May of 2010, Williams recorded and released two brand new songs whose profits went towards Nashville's flood relief efforts. The first song was called ""We Are"" and was avalible for download via NoiseTrade's download widget. The second flood relief song was titled ""Let's Jump"" and was released on Ten Out of Tenn's Nashville benefit compilation, ""We Are All In This Together"".

In addition to her solo endeavors, Williams has recently begun a new band with fellow singer and songwriter, John Paul White, called The Civil Wars.   ""Poison & Wine"", The Civil Wars' debut studio single, has been featured in Grey's Anatomy, episode 609, ""New History"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Joy+Williams"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Big Thief's music, rooted in the songs of Adrianne Lenker, paints in vivid tones ""the process of harnessing pain, loss, and love, while simultaneously letting go, looking into your own eyes through someone else's, and being okay with the inevitability of death,"" says Adrianne.

 Masterpiece, Big Thief's debut album, is filled with characters and visceral narratives, songs that pivot in the space of a few words. Adrianne's voice and guitar playing speak of rich emotional territory with grace and insight. In her words, the record tracks ""the masterpiece of existence, which is always folding into itself, people attempting to connect, to both shake themselves awake and to shake off the numbness of certain points in their life.

151,baynk,319465,4189580,"Pushing beyond his playlist origins, the New Zealand producer’s debut album revels in eccentric details while adhering to traditional pop structures. Like so many electronic artists in the mid-’10s, New Zealand’s BAYNK (Jock Nowell-Usticke) got his start making chill, pop-adjacent songs that seemed primed for placement in mood-based playlists. His early attempts at surf-bro EDM sounded like what Kygo and LeMarquis were putting out on SoundCloud at the time; he used his voice sparingly, mainly as material to be sampled. In the years since, though, he has refined his palette. On 2017’s Someone’s EP I and 2019’s Someone’s EP II, his percussion took on the rhythmic impulse of Four Tet, and his rubbery basslines and glossy experimentalism were reminiscent of early Cashmere Cat and Flume. Using his Auto-Tuned falsetto to further texturize his songs, BAYNK’s fusion of house, R&B, and pop soon set him apart from the many similar acts scattered throughout the scene.

Adolescence is BAYNK’s most meticulous work to date. It revels in eccentric, distinctive details while adhering to traditional pop structures. Most arrangements consist of grainy synth loops, plucky subs, and house-inspired drums; his digital sounds are drenched in reverb and slapped with sidechain. On the Cosmo’s Midnight-assisted “How Does it Feel?” languid synth pulses and a funky bassline give way to some of the sharpest vocal melodies on the album. “Remember,” which features Rainsford, exhibits BAYNK’s talent for peeling a heavily layered song back to its component parts before climaxing into an ecstatic yet graceful drop. This is dance music for headphones, club music for late-night walks.

The best songs on Adolescence bend toward straightforward pop formulas and, tellingly, include non-electronic instruments. “Mine” is led by quiet piano and spacey guitar, while standout “Naked” blends acoustic elements and electric bass with shimmering synths. BAYNK gives his best vocal performances here: “Get caught up on trying to pin you down/Your fingers ’round my neck, they’re feeling soft now,"" he coos on “Naked,” evoking the warm upper register of Whitney’s Julien Ehrlich. He’s not a great singer, as Tinashe makes plain when she steals the show on “Esther”; he scrubs clean his imperfections with layers of automation, delay, and reverb. Still, BAYNK has a keen ear for melody and knows his limits, wisely ceding the mic to guests while he works the boards.

The album is nominally a concept record about the immediacy of youth and romantic first experiences. “I went through this period of not being able to write anything,” BAYNK told Apple Music. Being in a “stable and happy relationship” wasn’t conducive to inspiration, so to get around his writer’s block, he returned to the creative cocoon of “first love.” Lyrically, the album is imagistic and vague, depicting half-baked scenes of lying in the sun, holding hands in a car, and walking through fields. The narrative never coalesces into anything meaningful, and its emotional pull wanes quickly. First love invigorates but rarely sustains; it’s BAYNK’s elastic and original production that propels the album forward, the pulse of the beat begging us to feel something beyond recognition. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/BAYNK"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

""Kikuo's songs are always catchy, with a repetitive and cute rhythm. However, the words comprising the song are the complete opposite. Disguised in elaborate, flowery metaphors and descriptions, his songs often speak of tragedy, mostly in children. There's talk of violent deaths, murder, psychological issues, etc. Hence, his songs are often called 'dark fairytales' for they sound like innocent cheerful nursery rhymes but actually tell morbidly sad tales.""

Wilkinson studied 'Sonic Arts' between 1999 - 2002 at Middlesex University in North London, it was during this time in London he came up with the name Bibio. The name was taken from a small black and red fishing fly which was favoured by his father on their fishing trips to Wales during Stephen's childhood, the name therefore has nostalgic meaning which is often a theme in his music. His recording career as Bibio started with Mush records in 2004. His Mush releases consist of 3 albums and 1 EP. In 2009 he signed to Warp records and so far has released a further 2 albums, an EP containing remix contributions from other artists and several singles. Bibio's music combines electronic and acoustic/traditional instruments, his main instrument being guitar. Bibio's signature 'grainy' sound is partly due to the use of analogue tape and vintage recording equipment, which is more exaggerated in his earlier Mush releases. Wilkinson himself labeled his debut on Mush as ""Saturated Folk"". Bibio's recent output, particularly on Warp, has been more diverse, with an increasing use of his own vocals, drums/beats and electronics. His Mush debut 'Fi' was described by Marcus Eoin of Boards of Canada as: ""The antidote to the modern laptopia of pristine electronic music..."". In 2009, Bibio contributed a cover version of Boards of Canada's 'Kaini Industries' to the Warp 20th Anniversary 'Recreated' album. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bibio"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

163,the dead south,161327,3210302,"The Dead South is a four-piece acoustic ensemble based in Regina, Saskatchewan. With Nate Hilts' gritty vocals and aggressive guitar strumming, Scott Pringle's soaring harmonies and mandolin chops, Colton Crawford's blazing banjo licks and steady kick drum, and Danny Kenyon's prominent cello melodies, The Dead South blends elements of folk, bluegrass, classical, and rock which results in a unique, modern, and authentic blend of boot-stompin' acoustic music.
 
The Dead South has been hard at work since they formed as a band, having played several notable shows, some of which include: showcasing at Reeperbahn Festival 2014, Canadian Music Week 2014, Regina Folk Festival, Ness Creek Music Festival, Gateway Music Festival, Juno Fest 2013 - 2014, Grey Cup Festival 2013 where they opened for Serena Ryder, Saskatchewan Party Premier's Dinner, The Works Art and Design Festival, All Folk'd Up Festival, Frontier Days Festival, Long Days Night Festival, Picker's Cup Festival and the Cathedral Village Arts Festival.
 
On top of playing shows, The Dead South released an EP in June 2013 titled The Ocean Went Mad and We Were to Blame. Following the success of their debut release, The Dead South returned to the studio and recorded their first full-length album, titled Good Company, which was released in April 2014 to a capacity crowd at local venue, The Owl. Shortly after the release of Good Company, The Dead South showcased at Canadian Music Week in Toronto where they caught the attention of Jörg Tresp of Devil Duck Records (based out of Hamburg, Germany). He immediately signed the band, released the album in Europe, and has booked the band for numerous overseas tours.
 
Earlier in 2014, The Dead South entered the 104.9FM The Wolf Queen City Rocks battle of the bands competition where they won, coming  out ahead of 24 other bands. Soon afterwards, they were selected to represent Saskatchewan in the nationwide CBC Searchlight competition for Canada's best new artist. They subsequently received local and national recognition along with airplay on 104.9FM The Wolf , CBC Radio 2 and several other radio stations, some of which include CJTR Regina Community Radio, CFCR Saskatoon Community Radio, and CBC Radio 1 in Saskatchewan.
 
The Dead South has been interviewed and featured in many newspapers across the province, some of which include the Leader Post, The Verb, Metro, Bridges, and QC. They have been on Global TV and CTV several times promoting their music and shows. The band was also on the cover of City Slicker, a Regina magazine, which featured a band profile after having won Queen City Rocks.
 
Since the inception of the band, The Dead South has continually pushed the energy of their live shows, as well as pushed what is possible between four ordinary acoustic instruments. The unique abilities and viewpoints of each band member make The Dead South an impossible band to duplicate, and a fixture of the Regina music scene that will not soon be leaving.

Lleshaj, an Albanian originally from Kosovo, whose family fled to Sweden while she was a child to escape war and conflict in the region, was living in Stockholm when she met Randall, from Minneapolis, on SoundCloud in 2012. Lleshaj began commenting on the tracks Randall had posted and the two discovered they appreciated each other's music. After meeting in person in Minneapolis, they began working together in Sweden as Flora Cash. The duo has said that they've never revealed the origin or meaning of their band name to anyone.

In 2012, the pair met on SoundCloud and struck up a musical connection, leading Shpresa Lleshaj to travel from Stockholm to Minneapolis to meet Cole Randall in person. They returned to Sweden together and immediately began work as Flora Cash. 

They released their debut EP, Mighty Fine, on December 12, 2012. Their second EP, Made It for You, came out on June 13, 2013. That year, Lleshaj and Randall also married. A third EP, I Will Be There, followed on September 20, 2014.

After independently releasing a handful of songs and two EPs, the pair signed with Swedish label Icons Creating Evil Art, after which they released, Can Summer Love Last Forever?, in March 2016. The seven-song mini-LP earned them nominations for two GAFFA awards, as Swedish Artist of the Year and Swedish Newcomer of the Year.

Flora Cash broke into the mainstream with their song “You’re Somebody Else”; a track from their debut full-length album, Nothing Lasts Forever (And It’s Fine), which Steve Baltin, writing for Forbes Magazine called “arguably the most intriguing song on radio this past year.”. The song reached #1 on Alternative Radio and achieved RIAA Platinum Certification in the United States.

The duo performed several times on American television after making their debut on The Late Late Show with James Corden and toured with Sir Sly, Joywave, lovelytheband, Judah & the Lion and AJR throughout 2018 and 2019.

Throughout high school, he took an interest in film, and in 2016, he moved to Pittsburgh to major in film at Point Park University. During his freshman year, he broke his wrist due to a skiing accident at Sugarloaf Mountain and later broke his wrist again due to a skateboarding accident. While he was stuck in his dorm, two of his friends left music equipment in his dorm, prompting him to record several rap mixtapes while learning how to use Logic Pro.

After hearing the EP, rapper Mac Miller invited ROLE MODEL to Los Angeles for the two to work together. He was signed to Interscope Records in 2018.

167,fitz and the tantrums,1564016,22522776,"Fitz and the Tantrums is an American soul group from Los Angeles, California. The group was founded in 2008 by Michael Fitzpatrick, who had begun writing soul music for a solo project on an old church organ he had purchased. He added friend James King to the group as an arranger and soon after expanded the band to a seven-piece, including several horns. Fitzpatrick shares the vocal duties with Noelle Scaggs. Other members include Joseph Karnes, Jeremy Ruzumna, and John Wicks.

The group's debut EP, Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1, was released in 2009. Dangerbird Records signed the group in 2010 and issued their first full-length album, Pickin' Up the Pieces, in August of that year. The album reached #15 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. Los Angeles Times music critic Ann Powers wrote, ""Fitz & the Tantrums is the kind of band that communicates best in concert, but this album serves as a fine proxy and party-starter."" Aly Comingore of the Santa Barbara Independent wrote that the band members craft ""soulful, nostalgia pop that's not only infectious, but just fresh enough to make it stand apart from its predecessors.""

In 2010 the group opened several dates on tour with Maroon 5. On January 12, 2011, Fitz & the Tantrums performed the songs ""MoneyGrabber"" and ""Don't Gotta Work It Out"" on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live in Los Angeles. In 2010 the groups music video for the song ""MoneyGrabber"" was incorporated into the opening scene of a sixth season episode of the CBS crime-drama Criminal Minds entitled ""Safe Haven"".

Fitzpatrick has said that the band's musical style can be fairly described as ""soul-influenced indie pop"". He noted that while the band is influenced by the classic songs of the Motown and Stax record labels, the band is not trying to create an exact replica of that music. In another interview, Fitzpatrick talked about his decision to not use guitars in the band. ""I did want to try and make a big sounding record without guitars,"" he said. ""For me, I just feel like in any music that has a band, the guitar is always there, it's always featured, it's always prevalent. I'm just sick of hearing it.""

In 2012, the band signed to Elektra Records, and started to record their major-label debut More Than Just A Dream, which will be released on May 7, 2013. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Fitz+and+the+Tantrums"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

171,foals,1946079,96255740,"Foals is a rock band which formed in Oxford, England in 2005.  The band consists of Yannis Philippakis (vocals, guitar), Jimmy Smith (guitar), Walter Gervers (bass) and Jack Bevan (drums). The band has released seven albums: ""Antidotes"" (2008), ""Total Life Forever"" (2010), ""Holy Fire"" (2013), ""What Went Down"" (2015), ""Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost, Pt. 1"" (2019) , ""Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost, Pt. 2"" (2019), and ""Life is Yours"" (2022). In January 2018, it was announced that Walter Gervers (bass) was leaving the band. Edwin Congreave (keyboard) announced his departure in September 2021. In May 2023, Gervers was reported as having re-joined the band.

The band was formed in 2005 by Philippakis and Bevan, both former members of math rock band The Edmund Fitzgerald, and Andrew Mears of Youthmovies. Mears left the band after their first single to focus on Youthmovies. In January 2018, it was announced that Walter Gervers was also leaving the band.

In early 2007, the band released the limited edition 7"" singles Hummer and Mathletics, both produced by Gareth Parton. In the summer of 2007 Foals began working on their debut album in New York. It was produced by Dave Sitek of TV On The Radio, however, the band decided to mix the album themselves, stating that Sitek made the first master copy of the album sound like ""it was recorded in the Grand Canyon"". Yannis has stated multiple times during various interviews that Foals and Dave Sitek are on good terms, even though the copy by Sitek was rejected by the band. 

Foals released their debut album, entitled Antidotes, on 24 March 2008 in the UK and 8 April 2008 in the US. The album was a commercial success in the United Kingdom, debuting at No. 3 in the UK Albums Charts. The album was a minor success in other countries, charting in Japan, France and the Netherlands. Non-UK versions of the album include the early Parton produced singles.

In August 2009, Foals started recording their second album at Svenska Grammofon Studion in Gothenburg, Sweden. The album, Total Life Forever, has been described by the band members as sounding like ""tropical prog"" and ""like the dream of an eagle dying"". The band have described the album as being ""a lot less funk"" than they had originally planned. The album was produced by Luke Smith, formerly of Clor, and its title is named after an element of Ray Kurzweil's theory of singularity. The band's frontman Yannis Philippakis has professed a long time interest in futurology, with it informing numerous songs on Total Life Forever.

On 1 March 2010, the promotional single ""Spanish Sahara"" was first played on Zane Lowe's show Radio 1. Foals' new website was updated that night with the release of a video for the track directed by longtime collaborator Dave Ma. On 6 March, the Total Life Forever site was officially launched. Puzzles revealed images, lyrics and sound clips of songs from the album. The last clip appeared on 12 March, and resulted with a password entry for the Foals' new website. The site was opened on 13 March and presented the whole new art concept and media including samples of songs, photos and videos. Lead single ""This Orient"" was released on 3 May 2010. The album was finally released on 10 May 2010. ""Spanish Sahara"" was later released as a full physical single in September 2010, featuring an edited remix starring the strings of London Contemporary Orchestra. The album was nominated for the 2010 Mercury Prize.

176,the warning,145803,6012356,"There are multiple artists tracked on this page. 

1) The Warning are a rock band originating from Monterrey, Mexico. The band was formed in 2013 by the Villarreal Vélez sisters: Daniela (guitar, lead and backing vocals, piano), Paulina (drums, lead and backing vocals, piano), and Alejandra (bass guitar, piano, backing vocals). They have released four studio albums, two EPs, and eight music videos. Their latest studio album, Keep Me Fed, was released on June 28th, 2024.

The Villarreal Vélez sisters were raised in Monterrey, and all received training on various instruments at an early age. At some point in their childhood, Daniela and Paulina had selected guitar and drums as their primary instruments, respectively. When the youngest of the three, Alejandra, selected bass guitar as her primary instrument at about age 7, the sisters decided to form a rock power trio in 2013. They learned to play rock songs, often via the Rock Band video game series, and posted videos of their performances on YouTube.

In 2014, 12-year-old Paulina was profiled in the women's drumming publication Tom Tom Magazine. The band first gained widespread notice later in 2014 when, at ages 9 through 14, their YouTube video in which they performed Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"" went viral among rock music fans, eventually earning more than 20 million views. The video received attention from Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett, who offered particular praise for Paulina, saying, ""The drummer kicks maximum ass!""

Due to notice gained from their ""Enter Sandman"" video, The Warning decided to seek a record deal and develop their songs. They raised money through a successful GoFundMe appeal to record the six-song EP Escape the Mind, which was released in 2015. During the production of the EP, the band met producer Jake Carmona, who went on to contribute to Escape the Mind and their next three albums. In April 2015, the band appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. During this period the sisters raised funds, including a donation from DeGeneres and the Target Corporation, to attend a five-week training program at Berklee College of Music in the United States.

They also gave two presentations at the TEDx conference at the University of Nevada in 2016 and 2017.[17][18] The band was known for practicing with the Rock Band video game series early in their history; designers returned the favor by including several songs by The Warning in the 2018 edition of the series.[19][20]

The Warning's first full-length album, XXI Century Blood, was released in 2017. During this period they were invited to perform at the Mother of All Rock Festival in Monterrey and also opened a show for The Killers in that city. Their second album Queen of the Murder Scene was released in November 2018. They announced an extensive upcoming tour throughout North America in late 2019, though it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In August 2020, The Warning signed a five-album deal with Lava Records, and began work on a new album with producer David Bendeth. The song ""Choke"" was released in May 2021. Later that year, The Warning appeared on the Metallica tribute album The Metallica Blacklist, performing another cover of ""Enter Sandman"", this time with singer Alessia Cara. The six-song EP Mayday was released in October 2021, and The Warning embarked on a tour of North America in early 2022, performing more than 30 dates as headliners plus opening for Foo Fighters, Sammy Hagar and the Circle, and Stone Temple Pilots. They released the single ""Money"" in March 2022, and the song reached no. 31 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Airplay chart. The full-length album Error, comprising the six tracks from the Mayday EP plus ""Money"" and seven new songs, was released in June 2022. In July 2022, they embarked on a U.S. tour supporting Halestorm and The Pretty Reckless and appearing at festivals like Burlington's Sound of Music Festival, Iceberg Alley, Summerfest, and Upheaval, before resuming their headlining tour in August 2022. In the Fall of 2022, The Warning performed at additional festivals (Louder Than Life, Aftershock, Peninsula Tecate, Rock al Parque), supported a second US tour with Halestorm, a Canada tour with Three Days Grace, a Guns N' Roses tour stop in their home city of Monterrey, Mexico, and performed small-venue concerts in Las Vegas, California, and Lima, Peru. The band supported Muse during several dates on the Will of the People World Tour in both Mexico and Europe. In September 2023, they opened for Guns N' Roses again on two dates of the We're F'N' Back! Tour. In early 2024, the band announced on social media that their fourth studio album Keep Me Fed will be released in June 2024. In March 2024 three new singles from the upcoming album were released: ""S!CK"", ""Hell You Call a Dream"" and ""Que Mas Quieres"".

177,lila downs,205819,2829796,"Lila Downs (born Ana Lila Downs Sánchez on 9 September 1969 in Tlaxiaco) is a Mexican singer and actress. She performs her own compositions and the works of others in multiple genres, as well as tapping into Mexican traditional and popular music.

Downs grew up there and in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She began singing ranchera music at an early age, and later sang at the fiestas of the towns in her mountain region, la Mixteca. She sang with the band Los Cadetes de Yodoyuxi and later with La Trova Serrana, a group of folk musicians from the Zapotec town of Guelatao, Oaxaca. At that time she met her musical collaborator Paul Cohen and began to create her own musical compositions, which tap into native Mesoamerican music of the Mixtec, Zapotec, Maya and Nahuatl cultures. Cohen went on to become both Downs's husband and her artistic director. 

Downs is the daughter of Mixtec cabaret singer Anita Sánchez and Allen Downs, a Scottish/English-American professor of art and cinematographer from Minnesota. She grew up partly in the Mexican state of Oaxaca, partly in California as a teen, and Minnesota as an adult where she  studied voice and social anthropology at the University of Minnesota.  She also studied in a school of fine arts (Bellas Artes) in Oaxaca when she later returned to Mexico where she learned to weave. 

In following the years, Downs and her band toured widely in Mexico, South America, the US and Europe. She was also heard in a duet with Caetano Veloso for the soundtrack to the movie Frida in a song, Burn it Blue, that was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song and that she performed at the 75th Academy Awards. Other songs that she performed on the soundtrack are ""Benediction and Dream,"" ""Estrella Oscura,"" and ""La Llorona."" Other movies with a Lila Downs song are Tortilla Soup, Real Women Have Curves and Fados by Carlos Saura. She was also invited to the Twelve Girls Band's concert in Shanghai, where she sings in French and English. Downs is currently based in Coyoacán, a borough of Mexico City.

Downs 2008 album is ""Ojo de Culebra / Shake Away"" and includes ""I Envy The Wind"" (song) by Lucinda Williams and ""I Would Never"" by The Blue Nile. She also collaborates with artists like La Mari (singer) from Chambao (band) and Enrique Bunbury from Héroes del Silencio.

Getting closer to the ""real"" story, here's a poignant, fascinating bio of Lila Downs, by an excellent writer:

Lila Downs: With a Song in Her Soul
Lorenza Muñoz, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer

     Lila Downs OAXACA, Mexico--Lila Downs knelt onstage, as if in prayer, in a dark auditorium, only a few dim lights reflected off her onyx-black hair and ruby-red lips. Before a hometown crowd, she directed her prayer-like song to La Llorona. Downs' powerful voice echoed off the stage. Suddenly she became La Llorona--a mythical woman said to haunt the river valleys of Mexico, weeping and moaning for her children whom she drowned in a fit of madness. Her story has been repeated for centuries in Mexican folklore, with a little variation but always the same tragic feeling.

The hushed audience watched her, transfixed, as she knelt in her traditional silk black and red blouse, a huipil, calling out in agony and adoration to the ghost of La Llorona:

    You came out of the church one day Llorona and I saw you pass by Such a beautiful huipil you were wearing, Llorona that I thought you were the virgin. Oh my Llorona, Llorona dressed in a celestial blue And even if it costs me my life, Llorona, I will not stop adoring you.

    Lila DownsShe ended her song, and for several seconds the audience members seemed not to breathe or move until they heaved a collective sigh. They had been transported to an imaginary place. They had just experienced Lila Downs at her best.

    If Downs' performances are marked by anything, it is an uncanny ability to become the character of a song. Whether it is La Llorona, or a sensual jazz singer of ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" in flawless English, or a coquettish Mexican singing a bolero, or a native Indian conveying the sad stories of Mexico's Mixtec, Nahuatl or Zapotec cultures in their languages, Downs discovers a part of herself in the essence in each song. She is a reflection of a 21st century world culture where ethnicity and national boundaries are blurred.

    The 32-year-old is best known in Los Angeles for her electrifying performance at last year's World Festival of Sacred Music. Downs received a standing ovation that night, an honor given to only one other festival participant--the Dalai Lama.

    Lila DownsShe has sung before packed houses at the Getty and at LunaPark. In 1998, she performed live on KPFK-FM (90.7). The CD of that performance, a modest endeavor with only acoustic guitar and piano accompaniment, has been the biggest-selling benefit album in KPFK history, said operations director Betto Arcos. At the Sacred Music Festival, ""she was singing in Mixtec, Maya, Nahuatl and she stole the heart of not just Latinos but everyone,"" Arcos said.

    A relative newcomer to the music scene, with only two albums released, Downs and her band recently signed a deal with Narada/Virgin records, a company that also distributes other global music acts and labels, including Peter Gabriel's Real World and David Byrne's Luaka Bop. Her first album for Narada, tentatively scheduled for release Aug. 29, will be original songs written by Downs inspired by border life. The music will include cumbias, rancheras and other eclectic mixes. Monday, Downs returns to Los Angeles for a performance at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre. Downs' bicultural background, her exotic beauty and startling voice, in addition to the growing popularity of world music, could position her to reach international success.

    ""I was struck by her voice and the commitment that she has made to her cultural background--she integrates it in a very modern way that makes it accessible,"" said Richard Denhart, senior director of artists and repertoire for Narada. ""I think of her as a developing artist. She really has no track record, and so it is a challenge to get her to the United States as much as possible to get her music out.""

    Indeed, having sung professionally for only seven years, she is still ironing out the kinks in her voice. Some critics say her eclectic song selection and arrangement obstruct the flow of her albums. To get to the next level, they believe, she must refine her performances and find a top-notch producer.

    ""She doesn't have a perfect voice, but she sure can perform,"" said Tom Schnabel, host of ""Cafe L.A."" on KCRW-FM (89.9). ""Her strength is the way she can win a crowd. Look, Maria Callas used to blow notes right and left, but she would also blow an audience away. Same with Lila. She has a hell of a lot of stage presence. She can emote and be very dramatic.""

    Drama has been a constant presence in Lila Downs' life. There is an aura about her that suggests something ethereal. She is thin, with thick straight hair pulled tight into two braids often decorated by the brightly colored ribbons of her native Oaxacan Zapotec and Mixtec Indian culture--a look that has existed for centuries, but which painter Frida Kahlo popularized in the 1930s. Wearing no makeup, she dons only a dark cherry or red lipstick when she performs. Her skin, a light olive shade that allows for very light freckles to form on her nose, is in stark contrast to her dark hair, ink-black eyes and arched eyebrows. Her scent is of a musk oil, sensually perfuming the air around her.

    Downs' mother, Anita, a willful, intelligent woman, decided at an early age that she would escape the chains of her ancient village. Born in San Miguel El Grande, deep in the mountains of Oaxaca, Anita was married off to an abusive man at age 15. One night as her husband snored off the day's drunken adventure, she escaped to Mexico City, literally barefoot, penniless and barely able to speak Spanish.

    Being a quick study, Anita became fluent in Spanish, though never forgetting her native Mixtec. Being a striking beauty, she quickly found a job singing at a cabaret.

    It was there one night in 1961 that Allen Downs appeared in her life. An adventurous professor of art and cinematography, Downs had come to Mexico to film the flight of the blue-winged teal from Canada to the Yucatan Peninsula. But when he set his eyes on Anita, Downs quickly forgot about the ducks.

    ""He had never seen a Mixtequita like me,"" recalled Anita, in slightly accented Spanish, laughing at the memory. ""Even though he didn't speak Spanish and I didn't speak English, we understood each other.""

    There was one little snag in their love affair, however. Allen Downs was married. Within a few years, he secured a divorce, moved to Mexico City and married Anita. He wanted to have a baby right away. Wanting to make sure her husband was responsible and would stick around, however, Anita decided to wait. She waited seven years.

    Finally, in 1968, their baby girl, named Lila, was born.

    Lila lived a double life. Oaxaca was too remote for their daughter, so her father brought her as a teen to Southern California, where his brother lived. At Rowland Heights High School, she learned to read and write English perfectly. Anita opted to stay home in Mexico. So Downs spent most of her teenage years with her father.

    When she graduated from high school, she came home to Oaxaca. But here, her identity crisis began setting in. She saw the uglier, racist, envious side of Mexico. Who was this strange child of a strapping, white American father and a petite, bronze-colored Indian mother? In a country still suffering from the scars of many conquests over the Indians, Downs was the personification of everything many Mexicans loathe and yet desperately want to be.

    ""It was very, very hard,"" Downs recollected. ""I think what I do artistically had a lot to do with me as a person. I was very confused.""

    Her neighbors would tease her. ""You're the little Indian's daughter,"" the children would taunt. ""Yankee go home,"" they would write in graffiti on the family house.

    She sang, but only to her mother. The notion of performing publicly was embarrassing; it reminded her of the way her mother had made a living standing on nightclub tables, surrounded by drunkards.

    Suddenly one day, while taking a nap during a visit to Oaxaca, Allen Downs died of a heart attack at 68. Downs, 16 at the time, was the only other person in the house. His death is a topic she still finds difficult to talk about. She flew into a rebellion, angry that her father was dead, taking it out on her mother who in her eyes was helpless, almost submissive to the discrimination she faced in a society that resents its Indian ancestry.

    ""Up to that point I had spent time with my dad--the white guy,"" Downs said. ""I realized that people treated me better because I was with a man--and [especially] a white man. And then suddenly I was left with my Indian mommy. I couldn't handle it. How could I deal with the fact that my mother speaks with a thick accent because her first language was Mixtec? I was ashamed of my Indian roots.""

    Lila Downs Two years later, she fled to her father's native state of Minnesota for college and buried herself in studies. She studied voice and anthropology until her junior year, but then she became disillusioned. She dropped out for about a year and became a Deadhead, living and breathing the cult-like fascination with the Grateful Dead. Soon she realized she had stopped feeling and thinking for herself. She was, she recalls, like a stoned, unbathed android, unable to put her own emotions to life. She stopped singing--not a note--thinking it a vain and superficial exercise.

    Her mother, an elegant, finely kept woman, was horrified.

    ""I never thought she would dress like that--or that a human being would dress like that and smell like that!"" Anita recalled, her eyes widening in disdain. ""Her boyfriend had so much hair, he looked like a lamb.""

    To Lila, that stage in her life was inevitable. ""It was good because it was like shedding a skin and going through a growing process which we all go through one way or another.""

    After two years of therapy and serious introspection, Downs snapped out of the Deadhead mode, returned to the University of Minnesota and received her degrees in voice and anthropology in 1991. But she still felt she was searching for something. She was still unable to sing. It was not until she returned to Mexico that she found the healing qualities of music.

    Through music, Downs discovered herself, her Mexican and Indian heritage.

    But her link would be soaked in the tragedy that has haunted the Indians of Oaxaca for centuries. Even before the Spanish conquest, her mother's people had been overrun, first by the Zapotecs--a neighboring Indian civilization--and then by the Aztecs, who changed their language, stole their gold and imposed their ways. Today, Oaxaca's enemy is poverty.

    One day, home in Oaxaca, Downs was asked by her fellow Mixtecos to translate death certificates in English to their language. Many of their boys who had crossed the border into the United States searching for work had died. And though their bodies had been shipped back to their native land, their relatives wanted to know how they had died.

    It was so powerful, being this translator of death. She had to sing about it, to honor these boys with so little time on Earth. She composed ""Ofrenda"" (Offering).

    ""It took a long time to decide that I wanted to sing,"" she said. ""I needed something that was a little more intellectual and that motivated me. That is why I started to write.""

    In 1993, she resumed singing, performing in Oaxacan nightclubs, where she met Paul Cohen, an American saxophonist from the East Coast. They hit it off, becoming romantically involved and collaborating musically. Cohen is today the chief arranger of Downs' songs. With his encouragement she explored the grand Mexican ballads, the rancheras, the boleros, the ancient codices of the Mixtecs and Zapotecs and put them to music. Her mother encouraged her to dig deep for that emotion--sentimiento--she possessed but never really brought out.

    Indeed, most audiences seem to forgive her occasional vocal missteps. This was true during a February performance in Oaxaca, where her most fervent fans have rare occasion to see her live. Although she lives in Mexico City, she is considering moving permanently to Los Angeles. Lately, as her fame has increased, her time at home in Oaxaca has been reduced to a few weekends a year. So, many of her friends and relatives, who had come to see their local girl sing on this cool night, brought their affection and love, showering her with flowers and accolades. Her fans, mind you, were not only Oaxacans. A group of visiting Minnesotans heard one of their own was singing that night.

    ""We flew in from Minneapolis and we are just as proud as peacocks!"" said Marge Nordstrom as she shook Downs' hand backstage. ""I'm a music teacher, so I know what I heard. We certainly hope you come to Minneapolis soon.""

    Downs graciously shook everyone's hand, accepted the roses she was handed by petite Indian girls looking up to her as a near-idol. Though smiling, her exhaustion and nervousness was visible on her face. ""It is like dying a little bit every time you do pieces like 'La Llorona' because they mean so much to people,"" she said later. ""It's like a love song to death.""

    The idea of fame makes her uncomfortable. It brings new questions: As her popularity increases, will she be able to handle the demands on her time? Will the new record company force her to sing music that is more popular but not as heartfelt? Without her heart and soul into it, she knows she could never continue singing.

    ""I never appreciated being a vocalist. I thought it was so superficial,"" Downs said. ""You have to find the spirit to the songs, otherwise it doesn't matter how pretty you sing. I can't quite explain what it is, but I think it has something to do with getting to know yourself and feeling right about what you're doing.""

Lila Downs has one of the world’s most singular voices and innovative approaches to music. She is the daughter of a Mixtec Indian woman, Anastasia Sanchez, who ran away from her village at 15 to sing in Mexico City cantinas and a University of Minnesota professor Allen Downs, who saw her singing and fell in love.

Lila grew up both in Minnesota and Oaxaca, and her music and vocal artistry has many influences, including the folk and ranchera music of Mexico and South America and American folk, jazz, blues and hip-hop. Many of her lyrics focus on issues relating to social justice, and often tell the stories of the workers who migrate from rural Mexico to work in the U.S. She studied classical voice and cultural anthropology at the University of Minnesota. “The Mexican American singer has a stunning voice, a confident multicultural vision grounded in her Mixtec Indian roots,” Los Angeles Times. “Ms. Downs has multiple voices, from an airborne near-falsetto down to a forthright alto and a sultry, emotive contralto,” New York Times.

She and her husband / longtime collaborator, Paul Cohen, have produced 10 studio albums, with “Pecados y Milagros” having earned both a Grammy and a Latin Grammy award, and achieving double-platinum in sales in Mexico. She received her first Latin Grammy for the 2004 release, “Una Sangre.” Her current project, “RAÍZ,” is a collaboration with Argentinian singer Soledad Pastorutti and Spanish flamenco singer La Niña Pastori. This album has garnered two 2014 Latin Grammy nominations for “Album of the Year” and “Best Folk Album.”

Lila Downs has performed at many of the world’s most prestigious festivals and venues including Jazz at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall and the Festival of Sacred Music – Hollywood Bowl. She has been invited to sing at the White House, and performed on the 75th Annual Academy Awards and the 2012 Latin Grammy Awards televised ceremonies.

Her music has also been included in several feature films such as “The Counselor”, “Tortilla Soup,” “Real Women Have Curves,” “The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada,” Carlos Saura’s “Fados,” “Mariachi Gringo” and “Hecho en Mexico”.

1. Palace is an indie rock three-piece from London, United Kingdom. Line-up: Leo Wyndham, Matt Hodges and Rupert Turner. Their music has been compared to bands such as Grizzly Bear, Fleet Foxes and Bon Iver. They released three full-length albums thus far:  So Long Forever (2016), Life After (2019) and Shoals (2022).

2. Palace is one of the many monikers that has been used at one point or another by American singer and songwriter, Will Oldham (1970). From 1993 to 1997, Oldham performed and recorded in collaboration with dozens of other musicians under many different variations of Palace (Palace, Palace Flophouse, Palace Brothers, Palace Songs, Palace Music). From 1998 onwards he started calling himself Bonnie 'Prince' Billy. Oldham released just one record as Palace: 1995's The Mountain EP, although it is now listed on streaming platforms under Palace Music. Oldham says this EP, recorded in the winter time, features some of his darkest, most challenging songs.

3. Palace are an alternative blues/rock band from London combining laid back guitars with brooding vocals.

4. A Dutch heavy metal/rock band which released a 5-song cassette in 1989 or 1990.

5. Palace is a Swedish melodic rock band founded by lead singer and multi-instrumentalist Michael Palace. Heavily influenced by 80’s imagery and sounds, Palace delivers a massive melodic rock/AOR sound.  With layers of keyboards, Palace deliver a heavier sound than most in the genre, with guitars a dominating feature. Swirling keyboards, layers of guitars, and fast moving 80’s themed melodic hard rock is what is on offer on “Binary Music”. After the very warm reception of the debut album, ”Master Of The Universe”, Michael was very excited to get to work on the follow up and face the challenges that came with it. ”I wanted to make an album that will give the fans even more of what they enjoyed the last time around, all the while staying creative and not shying away from new musical ideas,” he says.  They released their second album, ""Binary Music"" on December 7, 2018. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Palace"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Since 2018, Paige has embarked on a solo career and has continued to release her new music under the XYLØ moniker.

Raised in a musical family, Paige fell in love with singing and writing her own lyrics at the influential age of 13. By the time she was 18, she had honed these skills and was collaborating with her older brother, Chase Duddy. In 2016, XYLØ released their debut EP, embarked on national tours, performed at countless festivals, accumulated millions of streams and earned a platinum plaque for their collaboration with The Chainsmokers on the song, “Setting Fires” (by The Chainsmokers featuring XYLØ). After the release of their successful single “I Still Wait For You” in 2017, XYLØ evolved into a whole new musical artist. Having grown up behind the mic, Paige found her own powerful voice; one that currently resonates worldwide - both sonically and lyrically.

196,willow,1815874,59576169,"There are at least six artists with this name:
1. Willow Smith, an American pop singer
2. An American instrumental group
3. A Belgian indie rock band
4. An American singer/songwriter
5. A Dutch rock band
6. An American math rock band
7. Sophie Wilson, a UK-based producer.
8. German hard rock band, 1990s.

1. Willow Camille Reign Smith (born October 31, 2000 in Los Angeles, United States) is an American child actress and singer who is the daughter of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. She made her acting debut in 2007 in the film I Am Legend, and was most successful in the film Kit Kittredge: An American Girl where she won the Young artist award for Best Performance in a Feature Film. Apart from her acting she launched a music career in the fall of 2010 with the release of her debut single “Whip My Hair” and signing to Jay-Z’s record label Roc Nation. Willow has released 4 studio albums; her debut, ARDIPITHECUS released in 2015, The 1st released in 2017, WILLOW released in 2019 and lately I feel EVERYTHING released in 2021. She is also part of THE ANXIETY, a collaborative project with Tyler Cole. The projects debut album, THE ANXIETY, was released in 2020.

2. Willow was a four piece instrumental group from Newnan, GA.
Kyle Coleman-Drums/Fast Driving, Matt McClellan-Bass/Keys/Jingle Bells, Tanner Merritt-Guitar/Funny Faces & Rob Sepanski-Mandolin/Violin/Noise 

3. Willow is a young Belgian indie rock band that started in 2007. They create solid, semi-danceable, catchy popsongs with hints of new wave. In their short existence Willow won several rockcontests, with most notably Rockvonk 2009. In 2010 they became 3rd in Humo’s Rock Rally and won the KBC public’s choice award. They are known for their energetic live performance and their refreshing take on music history while still being capable of maintaining their own sound.

4. Willow is a self-taught singer/songwriter, who, in 1992 put down her Bible and picked up a pawn shop guitar. Three chords later, the songs came flowing out. Judging from the fact that she had no subsequent musical experience, one could say she’s a bit of a preternatural chanteuse. Like post-Christian rocker contemporaries, Alice Cooper and Marilyn Manson, Willow’s papa is a preacher man and prior to her fateful leap, she was an enrollee at Multnomah School of the Bible in Portland Oregon. The result of her departure from conservative religion…her musical renderings are of an evolution of a spiritual nature - an earthly, poetic dance in the dark. For those familiar with the fire and brimstone of artist Nick Cave, Willow may be the polar sweet angel of darkness, redemption and desire.

5. Willow was a rock-band from The Hague, The Netherlands. The band was formed by Marlein Heskes-Duarte and Rui Duarte. They’ve had multiple guitar players in the 6 years they made music. The music also changed everytime a new guitar player entered the band. Started out as an alternative rock band, they soon changed their sound to a more punk-rock sound, and in the last year added a nu-metal vibe to their sound.
Willow had some succes in their hometown and surroundings, having played more than a 100 shows, including the Paard van Troje, Plein Open festival, HOT festival and recorded a videoclip in the local tv-studio “TV West” for the song Spinning Around.
The Duarte’s have recently started a new band called Man-Made Madness, which also includes ex-Willow guitar-player Jordy Licht.

6. Willow is a math rock trio from Providence, Rhode Island, United States. Their debut EP, ""Roanoke"" was issued in 2012.

7. Sophie Wilson AKA Willow first made her introduction in 2014 when her debut Feel Me caused a stir when ambient techno veteran Move D included it on his Fabric 74 mix. A year later, the song finally received a proper release on Workshop's compilation EP Workshop 21 – the sub-heavy house tune with an earworm R&B vocal was a highlight on the LP which was number 6 in Resident Advisor tracks of 2015.
 
Rewind two years to the start of an on-going residency in Nottingham for 808, the chance to play alongside Anton Zap, Fred P, Tama Sumo and of course Move D, have shaped and crafted her tastes and DJ style which ranges from house to techno and all that falls in-between.

199,beirut,1620240,88743636,"Beirut is an American indie-rock and world music band which was originally the solo musical project of  Zach Condon (born Zachary Francis Condon in Santa Fe, New Mexico) and later expanded into a band. The band's first performances were in New York, in May 2006, to support the release of their debut album, Gulag Orkestar.

Condon recorded before Beirut was established: when he was fifteen and under the name of Realpeople, he made an electronic record, fashioned after his love for The Magnetic Fields. Condon was a straight-A student until he dropped out at the age of 17 to travel Europe with his cousin in a drunken haze, cavorting and partying with the locals wherever he ended up. It was during one of these evenings that he was first exposed to Balkan music (notably including the Boban Marković Orkestar and Goran Bregović), blasting from the upstairs apartment. Condon ended up with the Serbian artists all night, going through albums country by country, note for note. 

The first album under the Beirut moniker, Gulag Orkestar (2006), was the direct result of what he learned that night. While it may sound like an entire Balkan orchestra playing modern songs as mournful ballads and upbeat marches, the album was performed and recorded almost entirely by Condon alone. He did so on Pro Tools while skipping school in Albuquerque and at Sea Side Studios in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Jeremy Barnes added percussion and some violin overlays.

After recording, Condon formed a full band which at times varies in the number of members, from six to ten. Live he is accompanied by Perrin Cloutier (cello/accordion), Jason Poranski (guitar/mandolin/ukulele), Nick Petree (drums), Kristin Ferebee (violin), Paul Collins (organ/keys/tambourine/ukulele), Jon Natchez (baritone sax/mandolin/glockenspiel), and Kelly Pratt (trumpet/euphonium).

In November 2006 Condon was ""briefly hospitalized for extreme exhaustion"", the band's website said, and as a consequence the band cancelled the rest of the tour. They resumed performing in March 2007 and released their second album, The Flying Club Cup the same year on October 9th. Parts of the album were performed and recorded by Condon in his bedroom again, but others were recorded with the live band, which resulted in a more organic, live sound. While writing, Condon said he was inspired by French music, like Jacques Brel (whose song Le Moribond he covered on his Elephant Gun EP), and he moved to Paris for a while. During the extensive tour in support of The Flying Club Cup, Condon and the band more or less fell apart from exhaustion once again and disappeared from the radar in April 2008. 

Condon took a long break and returned in 2009 with a double EP, March of the Zapotec & Realpeople: Holland. The first was partly recorded in Mexico with the Mexican Band Jimenez and had a more South-American flavour to it than Condon's previous efforts. The second EP 'Holland' was credited to Condon's old name Realpeople and consisted of five electrotracks, once more in the vein of The Magnetic Fields.

The band's album ""The Rip Tide"" was released in 2011.

206,ethel cain,878819,73297820,"Hayden Silas Anhedönia (born March 24, 1998), known professionally as Ethel Cain, is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, and model. She is noted for her lyrics focused on nostalgic and Southern Gothic themes, while her music has been associated with the ambient, indie rock, and contemporary folk genres. While Ethel Cain is her main project, Anhedönia has other projects under different monikers, such as ΛTLΛS, Miss Anhedönia, Tommy, White Silas, and אשמדאי.

Cain released multiple recordings under various aliases before officially starting her main project in mid-2019. Three extended plays (EPs) preceded her debut studio album, Preacher's Daughter, which was released in 2022 to acclaim from music critics—many of whom called it one of the best albums of the year. Following its release, she garnered a cult following online. Her studio recording Perverts followed in 2025.

Anhedönia was born on March 24, 1998, in Tallahassee, Florida, and raised in Perry. She is the eldest of four children in a Southern Baptist family. Her father was a deacon, and she was involved in the church choir from a young age, like her mother. At age 8, Anhedönia began studying classical piano, with musical influences from a variety of Christian music. The church was Anhedönia's first exposure to music: ""My whole life was always singing, always, always music all the time"", she said. She left the church at the age of 16. Anhedönia was homeschooled.

Anhedönia officially started making music in 2017, experimenting with ""dreamy bedroom pop demos"". Her first extended play under the Ethel Cain moniker, Carpet Bed, consisted of four songs and was released on September 13, 2019. Months later, she released her second EP, Golden Age, on December 1. After the latter's release, she was backed by the artist Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, who praised her for her ""mature songwriting and understanding of melody"". In January 2020, after recommendation from Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, Cain was discovered by the rapper Lil Aaron while headlining a show with Edith Underground, Girlfiend, and Lil Bo Weep in Los Angeles. She was then invited by him to meet with the publishing company Prescription Songs and signed with them soon after.

In February 2021, Anhedönia released her first single as Ethel Cain and under the new publishing contract, ""Michelle Pfeiffer"", which featured Lil Aaron. The song was described by Billboard as alternative rock, folk, and ""even country"". Her second single, ""Crush"", followed on March 18 and received a music video on August 3.

The ambient-folk and slowcore EP was named by Pitchfork as one of The 49 Most Anticipated Albums of Spring 2021 and received a score of 7.6 out of 10 by the website. Later on August 24, a stripped version of ""Crush"" was also published. On March 8, 2022, she released a cover of the song ""Everytime"" by Britney Spears as part of Spotify Singles, in observance of International Women's Day.

On March 17, 2022, Cain released the single ""Gibson Girl"" and subsequently announced her debut album, titled Preacher's Daughter and released on May 12, 2022, through her own record label, Daughters of Cain. A concept album that creates a narrative ""centered around the character Ethel Cain"", it received a positive reception from music critics and was named one of the best albums of the year. It was also preceded by the release of the singles ""Strangers"" on April 7 and ""American Teenager"" on April 21, the latter receiving a music video on July 21. In support of the album, Cain embarked on the Freezer Bride Tour in 2022 and the Blood Stained Blonde Tour in 2023.

With a ""darkly poignant"" music video, it was included in the project's first compilation album.

In February 2018, an acoustic version of the song ""Deixa"" was released in partnership with singer Ana Gabriela.

212,grandson,680381,19699988,"Grandson is an alternative artist hailing from Toronto, Canada. Born in the small town of Englewood New Jersey, he relocated to the cultural melting pot of Toronto at a young age, and grew up surrounded by music ranging from jazz to rock and roll to rap, dancehall and r&b. He began playing guitar and piano in high school.

At 17, he relocated to Montreal, QC to attend university, and began working in nightclubs cleaning tables and DJing. He started writing music at this time, incorporating the unique blend of sounds he grew up surrounded by. He started experimenting with music production and rapping in 2013, and dropped out of school to relocate to Los Angeles and pursue music full time.

Adopting the Grandson moniker while living in LA, he dove deeply into rock influences such as Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana, and Led Zeppelin, while also listening to rap/R&B music emerging out of Toronto and alternative acts such as Twenty One Pilots and Hiatus Kaiyote. He found a small community of musicians to work and perform with here in Los Angeles. The live tries to create a frantic, mosh pit-inducing cathartic release of energy for concert-goers, influenced by early punk and grunge music.

Searching for his voice and for meaning in today’s divisive, chaotic world, Grandson confronts the most pressing issues of his generation through his songwriting, such as financial inequality, governmental and environmental accountability, and social justice, giving these topics a soundtrack with a genuine sense of urgency and frustration. The music also touches on adolescence, relationships, and the insecurities and difficulties of growing up through your 20s. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Grandson"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The group performed on the Black Cat Tour supporting Never Shout Never in 2016, and on every date of the 2016 Warped Tour. The band also performed on the End The Madness Tour supporting Sleeping with Sirens in late 2016. They played Slam Dunk festival in 2016 and 2017, and went on a headline tour of the UK with support from Chapel and The Bottom Line, selling out all dates. They toured the US in late 2017, with support from As It Is, Chapel and Sleep On It.

The group released a single titled ""Stupid For You"" on August 31, 2016 in promotion of their debut album, Double Dare, which was released on November 4, 2016. The album consists of 13 songs, and was preceded by 3 singles: ""Stupid For You""; ""Hawaii (Stay Awake)""; and ""Royal"". On January 26, 2017, the band released their second studio album Entertainment. The album includes 10 tracks, and was preceded by the singles ""Blonde"", ""Lucky People"", and ""Not Warriors"". 

You write a record, go on tour, endure a very public breakup, and pen more songs about what happened. Sound familiar? Well, this story sort of starts that way right before it makes a total 180 degree turn on a dime. 
...
Rather than talk about “doing something different"", Waterparks actually did. On the heels of landing their biggest chart and critical success to date on 2018’s Entertainment, the Houston, TX three piece - Awsten Knight [vocals, guitar], Otto Wood [drums], and Geoff Wigington [guitar] commenced writing again before scrapping everything. They reconfigured the vision, recalibrated the entire approach, and reinvented themselves. By doing so, the boys boldly break down walls between rock, pop, punk, hip-hop, alternative, indie, electronic, and even R&B with hashtaggable hooks and a level of gleeful playlist hopping mischief on their third full length, and Hopeless Records debut, FANDOM.  They went on the FANDOM Tour in 2019 and 2020, before the rest of the tour being cancelled. However, they recorded one of the shows, and released their first live album, FANDOM: LIVE IN THE UK in late 2020. 
                                                                                                                                    
Then on September 25, 2020, the band released their first single since FANDOM, ""Lowkey as Hell"", and announced they had signed to 300 Entertainment. Then, on February 26, 2021, they released ""Snow Globe"", and announced their fourth studio album, Greatest Hits. Four additional singles preceded the album's release: ""Numb"", ""You'd Be Paranoid Too (If Everyone Was Out To Get You)"", ""Just Kidding"", and  ""Violet!"". And on May 21, 2021, Greatest Hits was released. They reinvented themselves once again, making an album with influences from genres like hyperpop, pop, hip-hop, rock, punk, alternative, indie and even electronic and r&b. Since then, Greatest Hits has topped charts, gotten 25 million streams and and has led the band to perform on MTV. Waterparks has also started touring again, doing meet and greet shows in places like LA, NYC, Orlando, Baltimore, Houston, Seattle, Portland and Minneapolis. They also went on the A Night Out on Earth tour in fall 2021 across America with Zeph, Phem and Arrested Youth as openers.

Then, they started teasing new music. Awsten started an online clothing brand called Hii-Def. Then on March 9th, it was announced that the band was going on tour opening for My Chemical Romance on five dates  (Albany, Montreal, Toronto on two nights, Los Angeles).  Later that month, they announced they were going to play Sad Summer Fest from July 8th till August 5th across America with bands like State Champs, Mayday Parade, Hot Mulligan, Neck Deep and more. Then, in May they announced they had signed to Fueled by Ramen. Following that, they released the 1st single off of their fifth studio album, entitled FUNERAL GREY on May 14th, 2022.

During June, they went on the See You in The Future tour in Europe with Bad Suns and Phem as openers. They then went on the Sad Summer fest and released SELF-SABOTAGE on July 7, 2022, the same day as the 1st show of SSF in Sacramento. A week after starting the SSF tour, they announced they were opening for Blackbear’s Nothing Matters tour in September. On October 14th, 2022, they released FUCK ABOUT IT (feat. blackbear), the third single off their fifth studio album. On November 22, they announced the title of their fifth album, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. On January 26th, 2023, they released the fourth single from INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, REAL SUPER DARK, and announced that their fifth album would be released on April 14, 2023. In advance of the album, they released one more single, BRAINWASHED, on March 9th, 2023. On April 14, 2023, the album was released. In support of the album, the band will embark on The Property Tour, spanning late April to June 2023, with openers being HUNNY, Daisy Grenade, Elliot Lee, and Sophie Powers.

Yuksek born in 1977, native of Reims, France. Yuksek played the piano at the Conservatoire of Music until the age of 17 – the time he decided to give up his studies. After playing the piano for ten years at a conservatoire, he took part in several bands such as Klanguage, whose first album was released in 2007.
He created his first tracks as Yuksek in 2002 and then started to perform successfully as a DJ all over the world. At the same time, his first EPs and remixes were released on labels such as Relish, I'm a Cliché, Kitsuné, Exploited and Citizen.

Tonight was selected as the soundtrack of the show Le Grand Journal on Canal+ in January 2009. His track Extraball was the music of the Airness attraction‘s deodorant commercial as well as the Lacoste Red ! collection’s one in 2009. * His track Tonight has been chosen for the Peugeot commercial “Alchemy” produced on the occasion of the brand revival.

217,bonobo,1899672,101732798,"
Simon Green, known by his stage name Bonobo, is a British musician, producer and DJ based in Los Angeles.

Bonobo's first album - 2000's Animal Magic - was released via Tru Thoughts before being picked up by Ninja Tune. It announced him as a serious talent; able to bring a musician's edge to electronic music, with all the freedom that skill allowed. His subsequent albums for Ninja, Dial 'M' for Monkey and Days to Come, developed his sensibility, won him fans across the globe, and saw him develop his live show into a mesmeric re-working of his records. 

He has also worked hard as a DJ, a part of Green's arsenal that perhaps truly came into its own at the same time as 2010’s Black Sands. 2012 saw him take the uptempo, club re-edits of Black Sands from a seminal Boiler Room performance in London to dance floors across the world, and unveil a new light show that further enhanced the impact of these stunning songs. A remix album was released featuring reworkings by fans and peers such as Machinedrum, Floating Points, Mark Pritchard, Lapalux and FaltyDL. 

Later the same year, he finally settled down in his New York studio to write his fifth album. The North Borders was another long stride forward - both a natural evolution and a continuation of the electronic palette of Black Sands. With vocal features from Erykah Badu, as well as Grey Reverend (The Cinematic Orchestra) and Cornelia (Portico Quartet) it's another finely balanced body of work.

Bonobo has a long history of unearthing new talent (Andreya Triana, Bajka) and The North Borders saw him do so once again. The vocals of new collaborator Szjerdene are sprinkled across the album.

Since the album’s release, Green has gone on to play over 175 shows across three continents and 30 countries, wowing audiences with the hypnotic, extended live versions of his songs. He performed sold out shows at The Sydney Opera House and Brixton Academy, and his very own, day long festival at London’s Roundhouse. 2014 saw him and his band play the iconic Coachella, Sonar, Glastonbury and many more. This period of extensive touring came to a breathtaking close with his largest show to date at London’s Alexandra Palace in November. In celebration, Ninja Tune released The North Borders Tour. — Live. in October. A deluxe release including a live album, hardback book and a DVD of seminal live performances from a truly memorable tour.

In January 2016, Bonobo announced on Twitter that he intended to release a new album sometime in 2016. Bonobo released his sixth album, Migration, on 13 January 2017 via Ninja Tune. It was announced on 3 November 2016 with the release of the single ""Kerala"", and an official video. The album features Nick Murphy (fka Chet Faker), Rhye, Innov Gnawa and Nicole Miglis (Hundred Waters).

218,local natives,1318584,34901929,"Local Natives (formerly cavil at rest) is an indie rock band based in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, CA, United States.
After the three founding members originally met in high school, a bassist and a drummer were found, and they all moved to a house in Silver Lake in 2008 to record their album. Their debut album as Local Natives, ""Gorilla Manor"", was released in the UK on November 2nd, 2009, and saw a US release date of February 16th, 2010. The band's sound has been described as ""afropop-influenced guitars with hyperactive drumming and hooky three-part harmonies"". They started to attract the attention of the music press after playing nine shows at the 2009 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Initial reviews of Local Natives have drawn favourable comparisons to Arcade Fire, Fleet Foxes and Vampire Weekend.

Utilizing lots of vocal harmonies and drifting, dreamlike melodies, Local Natives have an intricate sound based around the delicate interconnectedness of all of their parts. This gives the band a sound that is able to be orchestral while still feeling understated, evoking the carefully assembled pop of Grizzly Bear. Their debut, Gorilla Manor, arrived in 2009 through U.K. label Infectious Records (with a domestic release coming by way of Frenchkiss in 2010). In 2011, Andy Hamm left Local Natives, leaving them to continue on as a quartet. In 2013, the band returned with its sophomore album, Hummingbird, featuring the single ""Breakers"".

220,baianasystem,134342,5683886,"BaianaSystem is a musical project aimed at spreading and exploring new possibilities through the sounds of Guitarra Baiana. This singular electric guitar - created in Bahia in the forties - was responsible for the creation of Trio Eletrico (a big moving sound system). It was also responsible for an instrumental language of the electric guitar which you will find in the interpretation of frevos, choros and several other musical styles that got new shape from the richness of the sound of this instrument.

It was from the need to expand this fullness of sound - while attempting to incorporate it into other musical genres thereby opening up a range of influences and offering the public a new dialogue with this instrument - that the Baiana System project emerged, where the Guitarra Baiana is the starting point. Idealised by Robertinho Barreto, guitar player of the group “Lampironicos”, who has been playing it for some time in the group and in many others musical projects, the BaianaSystem does not have a defined format but can assume many different arrangements. The underlying idea is the presence of a Live P.A. whereby the D.J. interacts with the Guitarra Baiana to produce a new musical arrangement. The DJ will work with the sampler and/or played bases, fitting in sounds and effects with freedom for improvisation. It uses resources such as layers, effects and loops, in a conception inspired by the freedom and psicodely of Dub.

The purpose of the project is to think about the channel of promotion and consolidation for the Guitarra Baiana (the trio eletrico);to perceive it as a special kind of Sound System (publisher of Dub) and to develop new ways of applying and relating to it. It also offers the opportunity to explore new possibilities of sounds with the Guitarra Baiana as well as investigating the interaction with the production of a rhythmic base.
The ‘mixing’ of language and philosophy and the creation of a new musical arrangement through developing an already existing one are the challenges of the Baiana System. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/BaianaSystem"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Liberato chose from the beginning of his career to maintain complete anonymity, keeping the utmost secrecy about his private life. In one of his very few interviews, granted via email to the music magazine Rolling Stone, he only stated that he was born in Naples and goes by the name Liberato, although none of this information has ever been confirmed by authoritative third-party sources or official documentation.

The mystery surrounding his true identity is a distinctive trait of Liberato's persona, to the extent that he only appears in public while hooded, accompanied by look-alikes, or hidden behind a screen.

230,balthazar,330592,9884362,"With hints of neo-psychedelia, electro-pop, and garage punk in their catchy, snarling alternative rock, Belgian group Balthazar formed in Kortrijk in 2004. Their second album, Rats, went all the way to number one in Belgium in 2012.

After starting Balthazar as teenagers, the lineup of Maarten Devoldere (lead vocals/guitar/keyboards), Jinte Deprez (guitar/vocals), and Patricia Vanneste (violin/keyboards/vocals) won a national youth talent competition in 2005 with the song ""Lost and Found."" They included the track on their self-titled debut EP, released in 2006. By then, they had begun touring with additional members Joachim Quartier (bass) and Koen Verfaillie (drums). In early 2007, the rhythm section was replaced by Simon Casier and Christophe Claeys. The following year, the band played their first shows outside of Belgium, visiting nearby countries including France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, and in 2009, they did a club tour of South Africa before returning to the studio.

Their first full-length record, Applause, arrived in March 2010 and spent a week at number 13 on Belgium's album chart. They followed it up with appearances at European summer festivals such as Pukkelpop and Rock Werchter as well as tours in support of the Joy Formidable and dEUS. With mixing by Noah Georgeson (the Strokes, Joanna Newsom), the band's second studio LP, Rats, was released by Play It Again Sam in 2012. It topped the album chart in Belgium, also charting in France and the Netherlands. Featuring the line-up of Devoldere, Deprez, Vanneste, Casier, and drummer Michiel Balcaen, their third long-player, 2015's Thin Walls, was their first with an outside producer, Ben Hillier (Depeche Mode, Blur). It reached the number two spot in their home country and the Top 20 in the Netherlands.

After 14 years in the group, Vanneste parted ways with Balthazar in April 2018. The rest of the members returned with their PIAS-issued fourth album Fever in early 2019. The title track became their first single to chart in Belgium when it debuted at number 47. This was succeeded by 2021 LP Sand: preoccupied with themes of restlessness and waiting, the group's fifth album featured a cover designed by sculptor Margriet Van Breevort.

It wasn't until high school, when Emily Massey contributed guitar and backing vocals to later incarnation Slow Pulp's second EP, 2017's EP2, that an improved vision of the band clicked. They soon made Massey lead singer and took down a debut EP that didn't involve her.

Now a four-piece, the group worked up the stand-alone tracks ""At Home"" and ""Steel Birds,"" which they self-released in 2018 while relocating to Chicago. Written and mostly recorded in a cabin in Michigan in January 2019, the Big Day EP followed in May 2019. Slow Pulp headed out on tour with Alex G later in the year, as they worked on their full-length debut. The project was not without obstacles; material was scrapped, and Massey struggled with her own health problems before returning to Madison to help her parents recover from a car accident. The COVID-19 pandemic soon limited travel. With Stoehr acting as main engineer, producer, and mixer, they were able to complete the album long-distance. (Massey's father, Michael, contributed an instrumental piano track.) Titled Moveys, it arrived on Winspear in October 2020. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Slow+Pulp"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

236,therapie taxi,119136,3136986,"Therapie Taxi, also typed as Therapie TAXI, is a French pop rock and hip-hop band. Formed in 2013 in Paris, the band broke up in October 2021, after an eight-year career.

In 2013, Adélaïde Chabannes posted an ad on EasyZic, a social network for musicians, to which Raphaël Faget-Zaoui replied.

They met in Paris in the Pigalle district. During this meeting, the 17-year-old guitarist-cellist played Jimmy by Moriarty. They decided to form a band and rehearsed on Sundays, first singing songs in English before choosing to sing in French, inspired by bands like La Femme and Fauve2. The band's first name was Milky Way, but it was renamed Therapie Taxi in June 2016 with the arrival of two new members: Felix Gros on guitar and keyboards and Renaud Bizart on drums (also met through EasyZic)

Their first single as Therapie Taxi was Salop(e). This song was a big hit on the internet7 and several record companies were interested in the band, and finally Panenka Music signed them to a contract.

240,femi,14855,91346,"Rising from Oakland's vibrant underground, FEMI celebrates a trio of life forces on her debut EP, ""Sweet Water Soul."" It has love, the gift of prayer, and is fluid like water, which is the underlying theme of the EP. In tandem with FEMI's jazzy vocals, sensual lyrics, and gracious intent, the result is an unrivaled suite of original songs equally danceable and reverent.

For the past 5 years, FEMI helped pioneer a visionary music community in her native Bay Area. She is often categorized as a neo-SOUL soulstress and compared with artists such as Sade, Prince and Minnie Ripperton. Yet her experimental fusion transcends easy genres. ""Sweet Water Soul"" incorporates heavy doses of jazz, soul, hip-hop, and Caribbean influences, a melodic hybrid of the pulses of Oakland, New York, and Latin America. In the same vein, FEMI is called beyond ""just"" being a singer and performer; She wrote, composed, and arranged all of the material on the record, and was heavily involved in the studio recording process with pc muñoz, a San Francisco-based producer with Talking House Records esteemed for challenging musical boundaries.

Sweet Water Soul's introductory track, ""Sweet Water (Rezo)"" -- rezo meaning prayer -- gives thanks to the love and protection of God and to FEMI's favorite orisha, Oshun, a river deity symbolizing prosperity and sensuality. ""Oshun energy is always present in my life,"" she says. This song is the first instance of the breathy, jazzy flute that is a main instrument in most of the tracks, lending the album an airy yet grounded quality. ""Imported"" is a spicy rhythm, inspired by her first trip to Puerto Rico (a trip she took to learn more about her Afro-carribean roots) and the grandeur of a love surpassing time and space. Riding on the sweet staccato of Spanish-style guitar, FEMI's sultry, layered vocals conjure the warm Caribbean twilight. ""If I knew anything about love, could it be with you?"" she asks on the teasing ""Crush."" This song is exemplary of FEMI's ability to weave the story and the music, with a sexy groove and delicate chimes supporting a lyrical quest for vulnerability and reciprocity.

Given the progression of romance, could this track be followed by any other than ""If I Knew"" A song reliant on reggae-influenced rhythm and driven by a tight horn section (ala Earth, Wind & Fire), it tells of surrendering to the love that was so desired. ""I Want You"" is essentially its cool, sweet sequel: ""This song is like a letter to my lover,"" FEMI says. ""You realize that there is something in them that lets you know it's okay to allow love in again."" ""Pages"" brings the album full circle, coasting on an easy rhythm to back Femi's reflections on writing, emotional freedom, and self-reliance. The track and album, gracefully ends with piano, chimes, and chirping birds. Like its pure namesake, ""Sweet Water Soul"" will quench thirsty spirits over and over again. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Femi"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

242,tourist,408710,6358226,"There are at least 6 artists that go by ""Tourist"":

1) London-based songwriter and electronic musician William Phillips makes yearning, bittersweet dance tracks under the name Tourist.

Phillips initially made a splash in 2010, when he was using the moniker Little Loud; his remixes of indie artists such as Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti and HEALTH circulated online and received notice from music websites such as Pitchfork. He debuted the Tourist pseudonym in 2012 with a self-titled EP (also referred to as Placid Acid) on Make Mine, which also released an early single by Disclosure around the same time. The EP's sunny, '80s-inspired synthesizer melodies and leisurely tempos were in line with the chillwave subgenre, but Tourist's subsequent work took a darker, more poignant turn.

The Tonight EP appeared in 2013 on the Monday label, and the release marked the shift in Tourist's sound toward U.K. garage and house, with choppy vocal samples and more urgent melodies. He completed high-profile remixes for Chvrches and Haim, and his EP Patterns arrived on Disclosure's Method Records in 2014. Featuring guest appearances by Lianne La Havas and Will Heard as well as the single ""Together,"" the EP was Phillips' most well-received release yet. He also co-wrote Sam Smith's smash hit ""Stay with Me,"" which won the 2015 Grammy Award for Song of the Year. Phillips continued to release Tourist singles and collaborated with Years & Years and Josef Salvat & Niia in addition to co-writing Låpsley's single ""Hurt Me.""

Tourist's debut album, U, inspired by the end of a four-year relationship, arrived on Monday in 2016. Phillips returned in the summer of 2017 with the Tourist and Ardyn collaborative single ""We Stayed Up All Night."" Three more singles arrived in 2018 with ""Hearts,"" ""Apollo,"" and ""Someone Else."" Two Tourist full-lengths appeared in 2019: Everyday and Wild.

243,donovan woods,179696,1600904,"Donovan Woods’ latest album is an acoustic reimagining of songs we already know, and yet it reveals new shades of his acclaimed songwriting and spectral singing that leaves his listeners hanging on every word.

Released on May 3 on Woods’ Meant Well label, The Other Way mines fresh meaning from the songs first collected on Both Ways, the Canadian artist’s 2018 release that scored him his first Juno Award (contemporary roots album) and a Canadian Country Music Award (roots album). Often hailed as a songwriter’s songwriter, Woods had been nominated for a Juno a handful of times in previous years, including two nods for songwriter of the year.

The Other Way brims with luminous renditions that are stark yet startling in their urgency. As the year winds down, though, Woods’ newest songs are adding even more color to his palette. Pulsing with an electro-acoustic heartbeat, “Way Way Back” pays homage to the long shadow that old lovers often cast and the ways they creep back into our memories.

Released on December 6, “While All the While,” co-written with ace singer-songwriter Lori McKenna, is essentially Woods’ songwriting in miniature, a portrait of quotidian life that swells into a poignant meditation on how we sit with and reconcile our conflicted feelings.

“Therapy helped guide me into the idea that it’s OK to be sad. I can be sad and still make jokes and laugh. I can be sad and sing. I can be sad while still being grateful and happy that people come see my shows and care about the songs I make,” Woods says.

“I brought this idea to Lori, and we tried to write a song about just that. Getting up and going on with life,” he adds. “A little celebration of the things we do while all the while a little sadness is still there with us.”

Perhaps without even knowing it, Woods has explored that feeling with quiet grace throughout his celebrated career, starting with his 2009 debut, The Hold Up. A decade later, he has become an in-demand songwriter whose work has been recorded by Tim McGraw (“Portland, Maine”), Lady Antebellum’s Charles Kelley (“Leaving Nashville”) and Billy Currington (“Sweet Love”), with over 200 million streams.

His secret? Fans don't just hear Woods' words – they connect with them as if his songs are telling the stories of their own lives. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Donovan+Woods"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

245,provinz,67967,3305237,"Provinz ist eine deutsche Indie-Pop-Band aus dem oberschwäbischen Vogt, die 2012 gegründet wurde. 

Die beiden Cousins Vincent Waizenegger und Robin Schmid aus der baden-württembergischen Gemeinde Vogt im Landkreis Ravensburg machten unter dem Namen Twice schon länger gemeinsam Musik. 2012 kam der dritte Cousin Moritz Bösing dazu und der Name wurde in Provinz geändert. Der Schlagzeuger Leon Sennewald, mit dem Waizenegger gemeinsam 2018 in Ravensburg sein Abitur ablegte, stieß 2017 dazu. Die Band nahm am Förderwettbewerb Bandpool Mannheimer Popakademie teil und kam darüber in Kontakt mit Plattenfirmen.

Provinz unterschrieb daraufhin 2019 einen Plattenvertrag beim Major-Label Warner Music. Im März 2019 erschien die erste Single Neonlicht. Am 3. Mai 2019 wurde die erste Reicht dir das veröffentlicht, die neben dem gleichnamigen Titelsong die drei weiteren Stücke Neonlicht, Was uns high macht und Zu jung beinhaltete. Aufgenommen wurde die EP in den Hansa Studios in Berlin von Produzent Tim Tautorat, der unter anderem auch AnnenMayKantereit und Faber produzierte. Es folgten Auftritte bei größeren Festivals wie dem KOSMOS in Chemnitz und dem Reeperbahnfestival sowie ein Fernsehauftritt bei Inas Nacht.

Das Debütalbum Wir bauten uns Amerika – zunächst angekündigt für den 17. April 2020, dann verschoben auf den 14. August, wurde schließlich am 17. Juli 2020 veröffentlicht. Als erste Vorab-Single erschien im Oktober 2019 der Song Augen sind rot, mit dem Provinz unter anderem in der Fernsehsendung Late Night Berlin auf ProSieben auftraten. Zwei Touren im Frühjahr und Herbst mussten 2020 genauso wie einige größere Festival-Auftritte aufgrund der Covid-19-Pandemie abgesagt werden. Dennoch erreichte das Album Platz 4 in den deutschen Album-Charts. Die Band gewann 2020 die 1 Live Krone als bester Newcomer.

Im Sommer 2021 veröffentlichten Provinz die EP Zu spät um umzudrehen mit fünf neuen Songs, für die sie unter anderem erneut mit Tautorat aber auch mit dem Musiker und Produzenten Fayzen zusammen arbeiteten, darunter die auch als Single ausgekoppelten Hymne gegen euch und Großstadt. Kurz darauf erschien zudem der Song Liebe zu dritt gemeinsam mit Majan und Jeremias, mit dem sie erstmals die Singlecharts erreichten. Ende 2021 fand dann die verschobene Wir bauten euch Amerika-Tour statt. 2021 gewannen Provinz die 1 Live Krone als beste Band und waren nominiert als Best German Act bei den MTV Europe Music Awards. Im Frühjahr 2022 ist eine weitere Tour geplant.

Am 16. September 2022 erschien das zweite Album namens Zorn & Liebe. Die gleichnamige Vorab-Single mit der Sängerin Nina Chuba erschien bereits im Februar 2022 und erreichte ebenfalls die Singlecharts. Als weitere Singles wurden vorab Verrate deine Freunde, Spring, 17 für immer und Unsere Bank (gemeinsam mit Danger Dan) veröffentlicht. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/ProVinz"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

246,the head and the heart,1082982,21754784,"The Head and the Heart is an American indie-folk band which formed in 2009 in Seattle, Washington, United States. The band consists of Josiah Johnson (vocals, guitar), Jonathan Russell (vocals, guitar), Charity Rose Thielen (violin, vocals), Chris Zasche (bass), Kenny Hensley (keyboards) and Tyler Williams (drums).

Composed primarily of transplants to the Seattle area, The Head and the Heart write and play songs that speak to the newness of a fresh start, of the ghosts left behind, of moving forward, all brimming with a soulfulness and hope for a better life than the one we've all been sold.

Stylistically, think a folksy Beatles or The Avett Brothers with a little extra oomph. Catchy piano melodies stand side by side with a tight trio of harmonies, and solid minimalist drums, groovin' bass, and plenty of hand percussion and foot stomps make the live show inspiring and really goddamn fun.

After the band self-released its eponymous debut album in June 2010, the emblematic Seattle label Sub Pop re-released the album. For the Sub Pop version, the song “Sounds like Hallelujah” has been re-recorded, live favorite “Rivers and Roads” has been added, and the album has been re-mastered. 

The band's second album ""Let's Be Still"" was released on October 15, 2013. 

The band released their third studio album, ""Signs of Light"", in September 2016. 

The band's fourth album, ""Living Mirage"", was released in May 2019.

247,duster,1271271,92656981,"Duster is a slowcore band from San Jose, California formed in 1996 with an initial lineup of Clay Parton and Canaan Amber, former members of bands Calm and Mohinder. They are known for their unique lo-fi sound, recording their music onto cassette decks and similar equipment at their home studio nicknamed Low Earth Orbit.

The duo released two demo tapes in the same year as their formation, Christmas Dust and On The Dodge. In 1997, they released their debut 7"" EP Transmission, Flux via Up Records. The band briefly recorded under the moniker Valium Aggelein, releasing Dweller on the Threshold as a cassette tape that same year, alongside Hier kommt der schwartze Mond in 1998.

Jason Albertini joined the band during the recording of their debut album Stratosphere, playing drums on three tracks. The album was released by Up Records in February  1998, being followed by the Apex, Trance-Like 7"" EP via Smooth Lips Records that same year. By the release of the 1975 EP in 1999 and their second studio album Contemporary Movement, Albertini had become more involved in the group's creative process and became a permament member of the band. 

By 2000, Duster had become inactive and went on hiatus. In an interview, Clay Parton stated that ""When we originally paused around 2000, it was because of me. I went through a breakup, and I had a new baby, so I had to figure out to provide for this tiny person. A band was just not a priority anymore. So the other guys moved to Seattle, everyone was just kind of their own satellite for a while."" Duster had reconvened in 2004, expanding their lineup to include guitarist Krag and bassist Ross Peard. They announced that they had began working on new material, but were ultimately unsatisfied with the results and left it unfinished. The band had dissolved by 2005.

After Duster's dissolution, Albertini and Amber went on to form the experimental band Helvetia in 2005. Parton released his debut album Birds in the Ground under his solo alias Eiafuawn (short for ""Everything Is All Fucked Up And What Not"") the same year. Amber also released the self-titled EP Canaan Amber in 2010.

Duster announced their return on Instagram in 2018 with the simple message ""hi. it's been a long time but we are recording a little bit."" In January 2019, Numero Group announced Capsule Losing Contact, a boxset reissue of their complete discography, alongside unreleased material. The boxset was released in March. The band's first studio album in 19 years, the self-titled Duster, was released in December 2019 via Muddguts Records. 

In April 2022, the band surprise-released Together, their fourth studio album. Clay Parton announced via his forum Stereobird that ""jason is not a part of duster anymore and he's not on this record and no one should be reading anything at all into that because we all love each other still and forever..."", asking fans to also support Helvetia's recent output.

In 2023, Numero Group released Remote Echoes, an archival release compiling the band's widely-bootlegged demo material. The band's fifth studio album, In Dreams, was similarly surprise-dropped in August 2024. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Duster"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
