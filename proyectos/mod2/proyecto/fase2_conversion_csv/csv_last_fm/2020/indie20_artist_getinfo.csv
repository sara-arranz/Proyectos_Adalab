1,glass animals,2166336,105915363,"Glass Animals is an English electronic/indie rock band formed in Oxford in 2010. The band's line-up consists of Dave Bayley (vocals, guitar, keyboards, drums, songwriting), Drew MacFarlane (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Edmund Irwin-Singer (bass, keyboards, backing vocals), and Joe Seaward (drums).

All four members of the band met at St Edward's School in Oxford. Dave Bayley attended St Edward's on a music scholarship and was introduced to Drew MacFarlane, who would become the band's guitarist and backing vocalist; the two bonded over the fact that they were both Britons who had spent their childhoods in the U.S. MacFarlane then introduced Bayley to Edmund Irwin-Singer, the band's bassist, and Joe Seaward, its drummer. They began playing together as a group in 2010.

On 28 May 2012, the band released their debut EP Leaflings, which included the single ""Cocoa Hooves"". The EP was released on independent label Kaya Kaya Records, a subsidiary and imprint of XL Recordings (part of the Beggars Group of labels).

In 2014, the band made their first tour of the U.S. and performed at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. They released three more singles: ""Gooey"", ""Pools"", and ""Hazey"", along with a collaboration with Argentine singer-songwriter and producer Tei Shi. All five singles were included on the band's debut album, Zaba, which was released on 6 June 2014. The band performed the single ""Gooey"" on Late Night with Seth Meyers on 9 October 2014 and again on Late Show with David Letterman on 24 February 2015, and toured extensively after Zaba, visiting both hemispheres and playing over 130 shows in 2015 alone. Their October 2015 US tour included two sold-out shows at The Wiltern in LA and sold-out shows across America including T5 in NYC, The Riverside in Milwaukee, and the Midland Theatre in Kansas City. ""Gooey"" went on to be certified platinum in the U.S., cementing the band’s foothold in the alternative music scene.

Their second album, How to Be a Human Being (2016), won two MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self Producing Artist of the Year and was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize. The concept behind the album, in which each song tells a story inspired by fictional characters, allowed the band to explore various musical styles and themes, contributing to its widespread acclaim.

The band's third album, Dreamland (2020), marked a more introspective turn, as Bayley delved into personal themes, touching on nostalgia and memory. Dreamland reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and number seven on the US Billboard 200, driven in part by the massive success of “Heat Waves.” The song, which became a global hit through TikTok, eventually topped charts worldwide, including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and achieved over two billion Spotify streams by 2022. The album was promoted with singles like “Tokyo Drifting” featuring rapper Denzel Curry and “Your Love (Déjà Vu)”.

Glass Animals’ achievements were recognized with two Brit Award nominations in 2022 and a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist, marking their influence in both the indie and mainstream music scenes. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Glass+Animals"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

El grupo está liderado por Juancho -guitarra y voz- y se completa con Manu -guitarra-, Hierbas -bajo- y Ruli -batería-. Sidecars son herederos de la saga que arrancó con Tequila y su genuina fijación “stoniana”, siguió con Ronaldos y su facilidad para obtener himnos de descarada picardía juvenil, y llega hasta nuestros días con referentes como Fito y Fitipaldis o Pereza, (con estos últimos les unen lazos que van más allá de lo anecdótico).

Dos temas sirven de muestra como carta de presentación de la banda, dos rockandrolles para todos los públicos, resueltos, atrevidos, efervescentes y magníficamente interpretados: “Muy bien” donde le dan la vuelta al tópico chico-busca-chica y lo cambían por un sorpresivo chico-abandona-chica y “Un tipo elegante”, declaración de unos tipos que se reconocen poco elegantes, nada interesantes y en los que , por supuesto, no se puede confiar ... Sidecars ¿No son un encanto?

The trio's first single 'A Calf Born In Winter' was released in May 2014 by Late Night Tales offshoot Night Time Stories, and saw support from DJs Zane Lowe, Cerys Matthews, Tom Ravenscroft, Gideon Coe and magazines as musically diverse as Test Pressing, For Folks Sake, i-D, The 405 and Ransom Note. 'The Infamous Bill' is an expanded offering of Khruangbin's exotic, individual sound. The EP's four tracks were recorded at their spritual home, a remote barn deep in the Texas countryside where Khruangbin's first rehearsals took place. Taking influence from 1960's Thai funk - Khruangbin literally translates to ""Engine Fly"" in Thai - the EP is steeped in the bass heavy, psychedelic sound of their inspiration, Tarantino soundtracks and surf-rock cool.

Mark and DJ's roots are in R&B, hip hop and gospel having played within the same gospel band for years. Both professional musicians, Mark began teaching Laura how to play bass in the summer of 2009. As such, Laura quickly developed a huge passion for the instrument and the aesthetic it brought to music she loved. Having worked studiously on developing her skills, both Mark and Laura were invited to tour with Ninja Tune's YPPAH supporting Bonobo across his 2010 American tour. The tour galvanised the two of them to start making music together more seriously, sowing the first seeds of Khruangbin, with DJ the natural go to for drums. Having kept in touch, Bonobo included Khruangbin's 'A Calf Born In Winter' on his 2013 'Late Night Tales' compilation. In addition to increasing the Stateside following the band has built, the release has helped Khruangbin in topping both the US & UK 'Last FM' fastest growing artists whilst 'A Calf Born In Winter' continues to be one of the most popular single downloads from the compilation. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Khruangbin"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

28,ellie goulding,3340724,125387323,"Ellie Goulding (born Elena Jane Goulding, 30 December 1986 in Hereford, England) is an English singer-songwriter. Having caught the public's attention in 2010 with her singles ""Starry Eyed"" and ""Guns and Horses,"" British vocalist Ellie Goulding quickly rose to the top of the charts with her infectious electronic pop sound. Although she started out writing songs in a folk-inflected style, she eventually grew into a more electronic-influenced artist, touching upon dance music and ambient synth pop. With her unique soprano warble and knack for writing catchy yet emotionally earnest songs, Goulding, much like her predecessors Kate Bush and Imogen Heap, stands at the forefront of contemporary mainstream music and arty, independent-minded pop.

Born in Hereford, England, she later moved to the country's east coast to study drama at the University of Kent. Goulding had developed a love for folk music as a teenager, and her time at university also exposed her to electronica. After two years, she took a break from her studies and moved to West London, where she pursued a career as an alternative singer/songwriter and befriended producers like Starsmith and Frankmusik, who gave her songs an electro-pop twist. In 2009, Goulding began building an audience via the Internet, where early tracks like ""Starry Eyed"" and a cover of Sam Sparro's ""Black & Gold"" were posted on tastemaking MP3 blogs such as Discodust. Goulding soon graduated from the blogosphere to print media, gaining praise from mainstream publications like The Guardian and fielding offers from record labels. She ultimately signed a major-label deal with Polydor Records and began making preparations to release her debut album. In the meantime, she penned songs for Diana Vickers, Gabriella Climi, and others.

During the final weeks of 2009, Goulding topped the BBC's Sound of 2010, a poll conducted by British music critics and industry insiders to identify new talent. Building on that momentum, she released Lights -- a sparkling debut album that splashed Goulding's vocal flutter across a landscape of acoustic and synthesized instruments -- in March 2010. Lights topped the U.K. charts during its first week and spun off ""Starry Eyed"" as a Top Five single (it also charted well in Ireland and New Zealand). Later that year, the album was re-released as Bright Lights, featuring seven new recordings (including a cover of Elton John's ""Your Song,"" which peaked at number two).

In 2012, Goulding returned with her sophomore album, Halcyon, which showcased an even more sonically adventurous, electro-pop-infused sound. In 2013, a deluxe reissue featuring ten extra songs was released; entitled Halcyon Days, it acted as a supplement to the original release. Two of its new songs, ""Burn"" and ""How Long Will I Love You,"" were among her biggest hits. The following year, she was featured on Calvin Harris' Top Ten U.K. hit ""Outside,"" participated in Band Aid 30's update of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?,"" and entered the U.K. Top Ten once more with ""Beating Heart,"" a song released on the soundtrack for Divergent. Another soundtrack single, ""Love Me Like You Do,"" added to the success of Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015.

That same year, Goulding released her third studio album, Delirium, which featured collaborations with Max Martin, Greg Kurstin, and others. The pop-leaning Delirium included the single ""On My Mind"" and peaked at number three on the U.S. and U.K. charts. Goulding returned in 2017 on ""First Time,"" a collaboration with electronic producer Kygo.

In 2018, Goulding joined Tap Management after almost a decade with First Access Management.[107] She appeared on a collaboration with Sean Paul on his Mad Love the Prequel EP titled ""Bad Love"", released on 29 June 2018.[108]

On 12 April 2019, Goulding released the single ""Sixteen"".[113] Goulding said of the single, ""...That age was such a pivotal year for me in many ways and this song is so close to my heart. It takes me back to the reckless days of being a teenager and I hope it reminds us all about the innocence of youth.""[114]

Goulding released ""Hate Me"" with American rapper Juice Wrld on 26 June 2019.[115][116] It was premiered by Zane Lowe as his 'World Record' on Beats 1.[117] In July, Goulding stated that her next material to be released would be the songs ""Woman I Am"" and ""Start"".[118] In November, she released her rendition of Joni Mitchell's Christmas song ""River"", which topped the UK Singles Chart, becoming her third UK number one single and the last UK number one song of the 2010s.[119]

On 13 March 2020, Goulding released the new single ""Worry About Me"" which was created in-collaboration with Blackbear.[120] In a radio interview with Heart the same month, she revealed that the album ""kind of comes in two parts"", adding that ""the first side is something written entirely by me which was fun and I wrote most of it in New York when I was living there a few years back. I play the guitar and I play the bass and piano and then I'm singing a lot of vocals. It's very classically influenced because I love classical music. There's a lot going on, it's a big soundscape and one big film. The second half is my kind of alter ego songs.""[121] On 21 May she released single ""Power"" and on 30 June single ""Slow Grenade"" with Lauv.

Goulding released her fourth studio album, Brightest Blue, on 17 July 2020. Originally scheduled for 5 June 2020, the album's release was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album debuted at the top of the UK Album Chart, becoming Goulding's third album to do so,[122] as well as at No. 2 in Scotland.[123] It reached the top 10 in Ireland[124] as well as the top 40 in over ten countries including Australia, Germany and the United States.

Goulding announced on an Instagram Q&A that she would be releasing new music which was not part of the Brightest Blue era at the end of January 2021.[125] On 21 January, she released a collaboration with electronic duo Silk City, titled ""New Love"".[126] On 30 September, Goulding performed ""Anything Could Happen"" as part of the opening ceremony for Expo 2020, held in Dubai.[127]

On 19 June 2022, Goulding performed at Rock in Rio in Lisbon, Portugal. After the concert, she announced that she would be releasing new music in July. The following day, she blacked out all her social media profiles.[128] Back in July 2021, during an interview with Joe Wicks, she described the forthcoming album as ""a dance record. It's electronic pop, a dance thing from outer space"".[129] On 4 July 2022, she announced the release of ""Easy Lover"" featuring Big Sean, which was released on 15 July.[130] The single did not enter the UK Singles Top 100, but peaked at number 31 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart Top 100.[131] It was followed by ""All by Myself"", a collaboration between Goulding and producers Alok and Sigala, on 7 October.[132] Goulding released the single ""Let It Die"" along with its video on 19 October and announced the same day that her fifth studio album Higher Than Heaven would be released on 3 February 2023.[133][134]

The band's primary member is vocalist, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer Anthony Gonzalez. The band was initially formed as a duo also with Nicolas Fromageau; it has released eight albums and three soundtracks, including the Grammy Award-nominated Hurry Up, We're Dreaming.

Gonzalez and Fromageau parted ways shortly after touring their second album Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts. Gonzalez records primarily on his own, with other artists as guest musicians. The band is signed to Mute Records and found international success in 2011 with the single ""Midnight City"". Their most recent album Fantasy was released on 17 March 2023.

Anthony Gerard Gonzalez (born March 13, 1980) grew up in Antibes, France together with his brother Yann. His family had a great interest in football and Gonzalez had trials with AS Cannes, while his maternal grandfather is the French international Laurent Robuschi. At the age of 14 he got injured and turned to music instead after his parents bought him a guitar. Gonzalez developed his interest in music and American culture while at secondary school. Together with Fromageau he formed a post-rock outfit called My Violent Wish. 

At the age of 17, Gonzalez bought a synth to record a demo, which he sent to a number of French labels. When the Paris-based Gooom Records appeared interested, he recruited Fromageau to ""help me because I didn't feel like I had the shoulders to carry the project on my own"". The band is named after the galaxy of the same name.

The band's musical aesthetic is characterized by extensive use of reverb effects and lyrics spoken softly over loud instruments. Gonzalez has been inspired by aspects of the American Dream and his songs have been outlined as themed around ""adult-scripted teen dreams"". Inspiration for the 1980s style found in much of Gonzalez’s music includes bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Pink Floyd, and Tangerine Dream. Between various electronic music properties and album artwork, M83’s style includes a mix of both contemporary pop and 1980s dream pop. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/M83"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Singing in the local church choirs as a boy, studying jazz and classical piano performance, composition, and arrangement, and singing and playing keyboards in the ska band Gangster Politics in high school. Watson left the band after graduating and began to explore other types of music, including electronica and ambient. In 2002, after returning from a trip to Vietnam, he decided to start a four-piece chamber pop group, bringing in bassist Mishka Stein, drummer Robbie Kuster (both of whom he had met at university), and former Gangster Politics guitarist Simon Angell. The group (which was technically a solo project with a backing band) released Just Another Ordinary Day (2003) independently.

In 2001 Watson released his first own solo debut, Waterproof9 and in 2006 his second, Close to Paradise. Early in 2007, Watson was nominated for a Juno Canada's music award in the New Artist of the Year category.

His band's song ""The Great Escape"" was featured on a third-season episode of Grey's Anatomy.

He co-wrote and performed on several songs on The Cinematic Orchestra's 2007 album Ma Fleur including the opening track ""To Build a Home"". His ""Missing You"" remix of Champion's ""Guy Doune"", from Champion's 2006 album The Remix Album, reached #1 on CBC Radio 3's R3-30 chart in early 2007.

Patrick Watson (the band) also won the prestigeous Polaris Music Prize (Canada) in 2007.

34,la maravillosa orquesta del alcohol,41308,1627026,"According to the legend, this peculiar band was created in Grafton Street, one of the main streets in Dublin, where musicians from all over the world meet to make a living by playing alive. Joselito Maravilla (accordion) and Maravilloso David (main vocals, guitar) met over there.

After some months playing on the streets, they decided to come back to Spain and start up a band mixing traditional music (Irish, American and Slavic), rock&roll structures and the most classic blues. To accomplish such an achivement, they recruited the two most particular musicians they found: inimitable Juan Mariscal (bass) and matchless Adán R&R Maravilla (guitar).

Once the band is setup, La Maravillosa Orquesta shut themselves away in their garage to carry out frenzied rehearsal sessions. Finally, they got a handful of songs. To back them up alive, la M.O.D.A. turns to well-known saxophonist Álvar de Maravilla, fiddler Bea Ruiz and drummer Maraviglioso Caleb.

At age 17, Kahan began working with school friend music producers (Cwenga Matanzima). This attracted the attention of his current manager Drew Simmons of Foundations Artist Management. His music also caught the attention of songwriters such as Dan Wilson known for his work with Adele, Scott Harris, Carrie Underwood, among others. Kahan deferred his admission to Tulane University to pursue his developing music career. Kahan has said that two career goals he wished for were to be verified on Instagram and to have a Wikipedia page.

Kahan cites some of his inspirations as Paul Simon, Cat Stevens, Counting Crows, Hozier, and Mumford and Sons.

In 2016, Kahan signed to Republic Records and he began working with producer Joel Little, known for his work with Lorde and Khalid, with whom he recorded six songs. Kahan released his first single ""Young Blood"" in January 2017 and gained over 9 million streams.

The album was recorded over one week at Kahan's friend Phin Choukas' home studio in Vermont exactly one week after the singer left New York City in March to avoid COVID-19. ""Cape Elizabeth"" was then released on May 1, 2020.

On June 17, 2021 Kahan announced his second full-length album titled ""I Was/I Am"". Five days later he announced the ""I Was/I Am"" tour. On September 17, 2021, the album was released. Throughout the summer leading up to the release of the album Kahan released “Part of Me”, “Godlight”, and “Animal” as singles ahead of the album drop. “Part of Me” was the only one of the three singles to be dropped before the album announcement.

Later opening on an East Coast tour with The Strumbellas that began on October 12, 2017, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and concluded on November 14, 2017, in Buffalo, New York. He performed at Billboard's Industry Night on November 16, 2017, at the Ludlow House in New York City, showcasing his pop-folk song ""Fine"".

Kahan followed it up with the release of ""Northern Attitude"" on September 16.

On October 14, 2022, Kahan released his album Stick Season. According to early reviews of the album from AP News, ""There’s irony there because these feel like songs both longtime listeners and newer fans will want to belt back to Kahan — not because they’re produced for stadiums or arenas, but because they’re full of nostalgic melodies that will resonate far beyond New England."" Kahan wrote this album during the pandemic which he spent back home in Vermont. Stick Season leans more into the folk genre than the rest of his older music which were more pop sounding. Kahan says that in his album, Stick Season, he wanted to pay homage to the folk singers that he grew up listening to. He adds that his greatest goal as a songwriter is to write music that other people can relate to and to be able to throw that lifeline to someone.

On March 17, 2023, Kahan was featured on Joy Oladokun's single ""We're All Gonna Die"", which was also released as part of her April 2023 album, Proof of Life.

On June 9, 2023, Kahan released a deluxe version of Stick Season titled, Stick Season (We'll All Be Here Forever), which includes seven previously unreleased tracks. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Noah+Kahan"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lleshaj, an Albanian originally from Kosovo, whose family fled to Sweden while she was a child to escape war and conflict in the region, was living in Stockholm when she met Randall, from Minneapolis, on SoundCloud in 2012. Lleshaj began commenting on the tracks Randall had posted and the two discovered they appreciated each other's music. After meeting in person in Minneapolis, they began working together in Sweden as Flora Cash. The duo has said that they've never revealed the origin or meaning of their band name to anyone.

In 2012, the pair met on SoundCloud and struck up a musical connection, leading Shpresa Lleshaj to travel from Stockholm to Minneapolis to meet Cole Randall in person. They returned to Sweden together and immediately began work as Flora Cash.

72,fink,754098,16078219,"There are, at least, two artists known as Fink: 1) A Brighton-based acoustic folk / blues / electronic artist. 2) A Hamburg, Germany alt-country band, founded mid-90s & disbanded in 2007.

(1)Fink, Brighton-based acoustic folk / blues / electronic artist

A recording / performance name of Brighton, UK's Fin Greenall - a Bristol-born understated singer-songwriter. He is an uncompromising artist - in acoustic folk / blues / dub - with an astounding stage presence, signed to Ninja Tune Records. With live accompaniment by Guy Whittaker (bass) & Tim Thornton (drums), they have played over 300 shows, in the last three years (inc' supporting Zero 7 & Massive Attack). In addition to his performance history, Fink has written with many (inc' John Legend & Amy Winehouse), plus remixed Elbow, Nina Simone, 坂本龍一 & Robert Belfour. Prior to all of this, Greenall - who grew up in the same city as Roni Size, Portishead & Massive Attack - was a Ninja Tune DJ, spinning trip-hop & breakbeat internationally. 

Fink’s 2006 debut Biscuits For Breakfast (recorded entirely in his loft in Brighton) saw him reincarnated to become Ninja Tune’s first singer-songwriter. Such was the impact of this collection of songs on the underground British musical landscape, iDJ Magazine stated: ""If 'Blue Lines' was about Generation X's experience of house parties, hip-hop and smoking drugs then this astonishing album is its millennial equivalent."" 

2007 saw the release of Distance And Time, another critically acclaimed record that saw Fink’s fan base spread around the world. As an incredibly accomplished and versatile vocalist and guitarist he has since performed as a special guest in front of thousands at London's Royal Albert Hall as part of BBC Proms, New York's legendary Carnegie Hall (where he performed a cover of REM’s ‘The Apologist’ in front of the song’s creators), and even Milan's 80,000 capacity San Siro Stadium. It was also Distance And Time that caught the attention of John Legend, with whom Greenall co-wrote ‘Green Light’ featuring Andre 3000 and ‘Set Me Free’ from Legend’s Evolver LP. Legend, in return, makes a guest appearance on piano, and co-wrote two tracks with Greenall on Sort Of A Revolution. 

There are very few independent artists who have quietly accomplished such an amazing array of achievements, and judging by this new and impeccable record, it doesn't seem that Fink - many a music fan's best kept secret - will be a secret for too much longer.

The sound of this duo is characterised by mixing the analogue with the electronic. Throughout their short but promising career they have released the LP Círculos and A los amigos. More tracks will be released soon.

This pair of musicians consider their music to be pop rock, although they don't really like to pigeonhole themselves into a single genre, as they consider that each listener has their own experience listening to them.

Here, most bands would have called it a day, but instead they frantically called friends to search for shows via MySpace. They ended up playing for free and headlining a show in Richmond, VA. This is just one of many stories that showcase Disclosure’s dedication.

In the past 3 years they have released 3 albums, have been part of an East Coast distributed compilation, performed in 7 states, went on 2 self-booked tours, and played over 50 shows. They have an upcoming full East Coast tour scheduled for July/August 2010 and they have no plans of slowing down.

80,terrace martin,497883,6270045,"Over the last decade few people have put so much time and energy into the culture they love. Beginning his career as a rapper and producer, Terrace Martin has lent his skills to artists such as Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, Lalah Hathaway, Raphael Saadiq, Charlie Wilson, Stevie Wonder, and the legendary Emotions, just to name a few. Martins big break came when he produced a Power 106 radio drop with Snoop Dogg. Shattering the acknowledged rules of hip-hop production, he samples everything from funk to jazz to classical to create fresh and original tracks. His wildly imaginative productions have made him one of the most sought after upcoming producers on the streets of Los Angeles. Born to father, a jazz drummer and mother, a singer, Martin's birthright was music. Growing up listening to everyone from Coltrane to Parliament, he began playing the piano at the age of six. Producing his first tracks on his Casio CZ101 Keyboard and an Sp1200, Martin decided to broaden his musicality and picked up the saxophone. At Locke High, under the auspices of Reggie Andrews, Martin became first chair of the All-State jazz band. As a child prodigy, Martin gained the interest of talk show host Jay Leno, who presented him with a scholarship and later purchased his first professional horn. Not only did Hollywood elite recognize Martin but also world-renowned jazz musician, Billy Higgins, who later made Martin a member of his World Stage All-Stars. Fresh out of high school, Martin attended Cal-Arts but decided school wasnt for him and began touring with Puff Daddy and gospels own Gods Property. From jazz to hip-hop, Martins role models include Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Jackie McLean, John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, Sonny Stitt, Grover Washington, Jr., Dr. Dre, Dj Quik, Battlecat, Premier, Pete Rock, and 1580 K-Day.

A string of singles and an EP for the Nettwerk label paved the way for his 2019 full-length debut, Ode to a Friend.

After several years playing in bands around the Atlanta area, Cramer decided to forge ahead as a solo act, adopting the Old Sea Brigade name in 2015. Self-released in 2016, his eponymous debut EP earned him enough buzz to land key support slots for Hiss Golden Messenger, Julien Baker, and Benjamin Francis Leftwich during his first U.S. tour. Later that year, he inked a deal with Nettwerk and began work on a follow-up release. Cramer's first single for Nettwerk, the rousing ""All the Same,"" dropped in September 2016 and was later included on 2017's Wash Me Away, the first of three EPs he would issue that year. The song ""Tidal Wave,"" from his next EP, Cover My Own, notched significant play on streaming networks. Cramer closed out a banner year with the Christmas EP Songs for the Holidays.

87,tom misch,679948,17773798,"“Apparently, I have a sound , and people can hear it,” Tom Misch claims modestly. For someone with a cohesive and sprawling body of mellow beats behind him, he seems mildly bewildered that this is the case. “I try so many genres that it’s hard sometimes to pinpoint. I guess my sound is uplifting, soulful, funky — and happy more than it is sad.” It’s a perfect description of his debut album, due in 2018, which brings together low-slung hip-hop beats, glittering disco, and noodling jazz instrumentation in a way only Misch can.

If Misch seems surprised, it’s because his fanbase has developed naturally. He never set out with any grand plan when he began making beats, and uploading roughly three tracks a week to Soundcloud at 16. “ I prefer a more organic approach to making music, but also to building a fanbase,” he reflects. “I don’t want a big push on my music as I don’t want to be as big as possible.” And yet, he’s rapidly become one of the U.K.’s most exciting emerging new artists, gaining 1.1 million monthly listeners on Spotify and playing a sold-out tour of the U.K., U.S. and Europe in 2016. Collaborating with a clutch of fellow trailblazers like Novelist, Loyle Carner, and Zak Abel, he’s accumulated a total of 75 million streams across all platforms to date — and it all started in his bedroom.

Misch’s earliest introduction to music came via his artistic family, including his psychiatrist father, a passionate violinist, who would take him to concerts and the opera as a child. He sang in a choir at school, and picked up the violin himself at the age of four. When one of his older sisters took up guitar and later abandoned it, nine-year-old Misch inherited the instrument, and taught himself to play Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Nirvana songs. Today, he also plays bass, banjo, and a smattering of keys.

It was one of his sister’s boyfriends who introduced him to the music of J Dilla at 15, and from then on, Misch was hooked. He took up Music Technology at school the following year, and began learning how to create his own “really chilled out, boom-bap kind of ‘90s hip-hop” on Logic Pro. “When I wasn’t at school, I’d be making beats,” he says. “It was just what I did.” As he began sharing his tunes on Soundcloud, he found the response was overwhelming. “You put songs out and you build a fanbase — it’s kind of addictive.”

A collaboration with his sister Laura, on the jazz-inflected “Follow,” was a major turning point for both siblings after it was uploaded to influencer YouTube channel Majestic Casual. The track features Laura on sax and Tom on beats and vocals, intertwined to mesmeric effect. “That was the point where I was like, okay, maybe I could do this as a career,” Misch reflects. “Suddenly it had 100,000 plays.” Shortly afterward, Soulection co-founder Joe Kay commented on one of Misch’s productions on Soundcloud, asking the teenage prodigy to guest on his radio show.

Soon afterward, in 2014, Misch contributed to Soulection’s White Label series, weaving together obscure jazz samples, guitar, and vocals to create the perfect summer listen (including the dreamy fan favourite “The Journey”). His Beat Tape series collected the best of his hip-hop instrumentals, the 5 Day Mischon project featured collaborations with grime MC Novelist and singer-songwriter Zak Abel, and his 2016 Reverie EP brought the official release of Misch’s most sophisticated songs to date. As well as soulful singers Carmody and Jordan Rakei, he struck up a collaborative relationship with fellow south Londoner Loyle Carner, whose mellow bars flow over Misch’s productions like a breeze on a hot day. Both artists form part of the much-hyped scene of singer-songwriters emerging from south east London, including King Krule and Cosmo Pyke. Each has a DIY mindset and a brooding, poetic approach to lyricism that weaves them loosely together. “There’s definitely a certain sound,” reflects Misch. “Everyone’s music in south London is really chilled. It reflects the vibe of this part of London — it’s laid back.”

Misch has lived in south London all his life, and he loves it so much that his new single, “South of the River,” is dedicated to it. “I much prefer the general vibe of south London,” he says. “I love this area, Peckham, Dulwich, Forest Hill. Singing that line — You should come south of the river — it just felt really good.” With its string arrangements mirroring disco synth stabs and a funky bassline, it’s an irresistible bop that nods clearly to Misch’s danceable new direction.

One of the biggest influences on Misch’s sound has long been jazz. With a degree in jazz guitar, Misch is an avid listener of Robert Glasper, Roy Hargrove, Cory Henry, and jazz-influenced songwriters like D’Angelo and Erykah Badu. “It’s kind of a warm feeling, when you hear a certain chord progression,” he explains.

In the making of his debut album, he’s also been drawing on inspiration from disco, house, and techno, discovered through the portal of producers like Kaytranada and Motor City Drum Ensemble. The euphoric feel of 1970s and ‘80s disco (think Earth Wind and Fire or Gwen McCrae), and the thump of nightclubs like Fabric or Corsica, inspired him to bring more movement into his songs. “I want people to dance at my live shows, I want to bring more energy,” he says. “When you’re in a club and you can feel the bass...I want people to have that experience.”

Misch’s sound is true to its roots — he still makes his tracks in the same bedroom studio in his parents’ house, and his mum produces his artwork. (“ Her work is very DIY, just like my music, and feels homespun,” he explains.) But he’s never afraid to explore new territory. “I think it’s really important to make music that hasn’t been made before,” he says. “I’m trying to work out what my sound is, and pursuing that.” Fans might think they know his style, but Misch is a restless experimentalist, keen to spend endless hours honing his craft. One of his favorite new songs is a “Brazilian-sounding” jam that reflects how deeply he feels about his work. As he puts it: “It’s about how you can’t take away my love for music. I’ll always have that.” <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Misch"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

88,dominic fike,1848366,100850066,"Dominic David Fike (Born December 30, 1995) is an American Singer and Alternative hip-hop artist from Naples, Florida. Fike first received recognition after releasing several popular songs on the website SoundCloud. Following the release of his debut EP, Don't Forget About Me, Demos, he signed to Columbia Records. Fike's song ""3 Nights"" reached the top ten in multiple countries. He later collaborated with the band BROCKHAMPTON and singer Halsey. In June 2020, Fike released the single ""Chicken Tenders"". In July of the same year, he released the single ""Politics & Violence"". Fike's debut album, What Could Possibly Go Wrong, was released the same month. The album charted in the top 50 in multiple countries, including the United States and Australia.

In September 2020, Fike became a headliner for a concert series in the video game Roblox. A few months later, NME included Fike on their list of essential new artists for 2020. He recorded a cover of Paul McCartney's song ""The Kiss of Venus"" for the album McCartney III Imagined. In 2022, Fike became a cast member of the second season of Euphoria in his first main acting role as Elliot.

Dominic David Fike was born on December 30, 1995, in Naples, Florida. Fike grew up with a younger brother, Alex, a sister, Apple, and an older brother, Sean, and is of African-American, Filipino, and Haitian descent. Fike went to Estero High School and graduated in 2014. Fike was a fan of Jack Johnson, Blink-182, and Red Hot Chili Peppers. He first acquired a guitar at the age of ten and learned how to play songs by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

During his childhood, Fike recalled that he and his brothers had to take care of each other owing to his parents' frequent absence from his life. Throughout his childhood, Fike’s mother was in and out of jail, causing him to stay in different homes, including those of his older brother, relatives, or his parents' friends. Fike's childhood life was ""full of adventure,"" as he and his friends would spend time in a forested area near their neighborhood that they called the ""Forest of Avalon,"" where he said they would eat snacks and smoke cannabis. He and his older brother Sean would also hang out at the guest house of his friend Stefan’s home, called the ""Backhouse,"" where they would freestyle. Later, they coalesced into a formal rap collective that included members Slyte, Ike Lysergic, and Seno. They attracted an audience in the community and Fike formed a sub-group called Lame Boys ENT. In 2015, the group started to attract the local media's attention and got booked into music festivals.

Fike started uploading songs on the Internet in high school and the first song he uploaded on YouTube was a song called ""Not A Word"". He also put songs he recorded into tapes. Fike briefly enrolled in a college but dropped out in less than 3 days.

Fike first received recognition by making beats with his then producer, Hunter Pfeiffer (known as 54) leading to several popular songs on SoundCloud being published. He released his debut EP at the age of 21 in December 2017 as an independent artist, which was recorded while he was on house arrest for the battery of a police officer. He later went to serve time at Collier County Jail for violating that house arrest. The EP caught the attention of several record labels and sparked a bidding war. After being released in April 2018, he signed with Columbia for a reported $4 million in August. All his previous work including the EP was pulled from all streaming services during the bidding war. Fike said the ultimate decision to join a record label was to pay for his mother's lawyer fee, who was facing drug charges at the time.

The EP was released again by Columbia on October 16, 2018. ""3 Nights"" was released as a single the same year. The single gained wide attention and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. It had an acoustic guitar sound compared to the music of Jack Johnson. It was placed on rotation on several radio stations and Spotify playlists and received favorable reviews from outlets such as Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, and Billboard. In reference to the EP, Billboard described Fike as a ""genre-meshing"" artist, and later named him a breakout act to watch, calling ""3 Nights"" a ""Motown-tinged breakout track"" that is ""trend-proof and irresistible"".

In January 2019, Fike revealed he was working on an album. On April 4, 2019, Brockhampton uploaded a video to their YouTube channel called ""This is Dominic Fike"" which included his song ""3 Nights"".

92,slow pulp,673364,16345386,"The dreamy songs of Midwest indie rock outfit Slow Pulp draw on moody shoegaze, hooky grunge, and intimate lo-fi fare. The band made their full-length debut with Moveys in 2020.
Guitarist Henry Stoehr, bass player Alexander Leeds, and drummer Theodore Mathews started making music together as friends in the sixth grade, naming their first band from letters in their first names. It wasn't until high school, when Emily Massey contributed guitar and backing vocals to later incarnation Slow Pulp's second EP, 2017's EP2, that an improved vision of the band clicked. They soon made Massey lead singer and took down a debut EP that didn't involve her.

Now a four-piece, the group worked up the stand-alone tracks ""At Home"" and ""Steel Birds,"" which they self-released in 2018 while relocating to Chicago. Written and mostly recorded in a cabin in Michigan in January 2019, the Big Day EP followed in May 2019. Slow Pulp headed out on tour with Alex G later in the year, as they worked on their full-length debut. The project was not without obstacles; material was scrapped, and Massey struggled with her own health problems before returning to Madison to help her parents recover from a car accident. The COVID-19 pandemic soon limited travel. With Stoehr acting as main engineer, producer, and mixer, they were able to complete the album long-distance. (Massey's father, Michael, contributed an instrumental piano track.) Titled Moveys, it arrived on Winspear in October 2020. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Slow+Pulp"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

94,claire rosinkranz,558490,8173994,"California native Claire Rosinkranz is best known for her lo-fi pop EP BeVerly Hills BoYfRiEnd, which includes Backyard Boy; her massive viral hit. 

Her overnight success might not come as a surprise to all, as Rosinkranz has been writing songs since she was 8. Filling notebooks and iPads with lyrics, turns of phrase, and poems, the homeschooled artist would spend hours writing lyrics to songs that didn’t exist yet. Sometimes, she’d help her musician father, Ragnar, with melodies and lyrics for songs he’d been tasked to compose for TV shows and ad jingles. 

Claire describes her style as alternative blues-pop, equally as inspired by early influences (like The Beatles’ Help!, Frank Ocean, and the Jack Johnson songs the family would listen to around the house) as it is by the singer-songwriter’s contemporaries, like Benee, Bruno Major, and Still Woozy. 

Claire traffics in lo-fi songs with intricate yet totally relatable lyrics about friendship, crushes, family, and feelings. They plumb the depths of the human condition in very short bursts, exposing the songwriter’s remarkable emotional maturity and strong, singular grasp on her sound. Narratively, tracks like “Tough Guy” and “Seriouslaaay” follow Claire’s stories from start to finish while Ragnar’s clean, crisp production buoys his daughter’s crystal-clear vocals. “He totally captures my vision and if I don’t like something, I’m not afraid to say it,” Claire says of her dad. “Because we’re able to communicate so well, the process happens so quickly.”

The “star of the show,” Claire says of her catalogue, is “Backyard Boy,” the final song she wrote for the EP and one that grew legs of its own shortly after release, achieving massive viral success all on its own. “I was getting DMs from people telling me that ‘Backyard Boy’ was doing really well on TikTok,” she remembers. “Then, friends started texting me. Then more people were texting me. So I opened TikTok and I had 300,000 videos under the song and realized, “Oh, this is a thing!”

Signing to slowplay/Republic Records in 2020, Claire realized the work and dedication she’d been putting into music for half her life was coming to fruition. In August, she shot the “Backyard Boy” music video but kept things close to the family, as she’s done for years (it’s directed by her uncle, the first AD is her cousin, and close family friends star alongside her onscreen). “I think people are connecting to that song because it’s about a feeling you long for, especially during this time,” she says. “Everyone wants to have this experience but it’s something we can’t have right now because of COVID. But ‘Backyard Boy’ makes you feel like you can.”

Claire has spent a few years drilling down on her craft by refining her songwriting and learning to play instruments like the ukulele, the piano, and the jazz electric guitar (“that’s the one I absolutely enjoy the most,” she says), which have helped her turn her lyrics into fully imagined soundscapes. “I consider myself a writer first and foremost,” she’s quick to note. “I’m super fortunate to be able to sing all my songs, and I want to sing them, but writing is my favorite part of the entire process.” <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Claire+Rosinkranz"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

114,caiola,40954,230900,"Jordan Caiola (CAI•OLA) is a songwriter/musician/producer based out of Philadelphia. He founded the indie rock band Mo Lowda & The Humble in 2010 and due to its intense touring schedule, the band became his main priority along with his side project NightSeason (founded 2016)- an indie/electro-pop producer duo. Though he always felt writing folk songs was his true “wheelhouse”, it wasn’t until the nationwide lockdown in early 2020 that he finally put aside the time to record a collection of those songs for his first solo album ‘Only Real When Shared’. The album (due out October 2nd, 2020) was entirely recorded during quarantine with producer/engineer/drummer Shane Woods, with whom Caiola previously co-produced all the Mo Lowda records as well as Arson Daily’s 2020 LP ‘Late Reflections.’ Caiola’s debut album highlights every aspect of his vocal spectrum and strips down instrumental elements to direct focus towards the lyrical content much more than on previous efforts. Jangly acoustic guitars, lo-fi drums, and lush harmonies makeup the bulk of this record, with sit-ins from multiple additional musicians sprinkled throughout. Caiola is set to release a new single every 2 weeks starting July 24th up until the full album comes out October 2nd, 2020. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Caiola"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

128,neil frances,496161,7216685,"The duo behind Neil Frances come from two different worlds, and yet their union sounds destined. Jordan Feller and Marc Gilfry first met in 2012. It wasn’t until four years later that Jordan called Marc to lend vocals to some demos, which were intended as a placeholder. As with the best of accidents, the two liked what they heard and Neil Frances was born.

Jordan grew up in Sydney, then spent time in London, before landing in Los Angeles. Marc, a California native, grew up outside of Los Angeles in Rancho Cucamonga, in a house across the street from his aunt, uncle and cousin. Since childhood, the two found themselves exposed to a range of music, from opera, disco, hip-hop and more, all of which informs their songwriting today.

These influences can be heard on Neil Frances’ dreamy debut EP, Took A While, consisting of five lustrous, reverberating dance tracks featuring one infectious melody after the other. Their sound caught the attention of Jungle and Poolside, who they toured with earlier this year. When the music discovery platform, The Wild Honey Pie first heard their music, they quickly invited them to play the launch of their Los Angeles dinner party series (held in early November) at Checker Hall. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Frances"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

131,bombay bicycle club,1511613,49170034,"Bombay Bicycle Club is a British band formed in North London, United Kingdom in 2006. In January 2016, the four members announced that they would pursue solo projects. Ed Nash has since then been recording music under the name Toothless, releasing his debut album in early 2017, and former frontman Steadman has been recording under the name Mr Jukes, releasing a debut single in March 2017. 

The band was formed by Jack Steadman (vocals, guitar, bass), Jamie MacColl (bass, guitar, banjo, vocals), Suren De Saram (drums) under the name of The Canals when they were 15. Ed Nash (bass, keyboard, mandolin) later joined the trio as they switched between various aliases before picking Bombay Bicycle Club. The band took their name from a chain of curry houses in the London Area and have released four studio albums, ""I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose"" (2009), ""Flaws"" (2010), ""A Different Kind Of Fix"" (2011) and ""So long, See You tomorrow"" (2014).

After winning the opening slot at V Festival 2006 ('Road to V' competition) and also played Reading / Leeds Festival for the three years running, in Febuary 2007 they released their début EP The Boy I Used To Be. This was followed up in October with the release of their second EP How We Are. In mid-July of 2009 they released their first album I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose consisting of 12 tracks. The album peaked at number 46 on the UK Official Album Charts.

In Summer 2010 they released their second album, Flaws . A UK tour co-incided with the release of the album which - surprisingly - is an acoustic recording. Venues on the tour reflected this new acoustic orientation, which gained them a number 8 on the album charts.

The lead single from their third album, A Different Kind Of Fix was released on June 23, 2011 and peaked at  #40 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in the United States, the band's first chart appearance in the country. The album reached the number 6 position on the UK album charts.  
The band added Amber Wilson to their live party as an additional keyboardist and background vocalist. Singer/songwriter Lucy Rose also joined the live performances on vocals, after featuring on several songs from the albums ""Flaws"" and ""A Different Kind of Fix"".

On November 5th, 2013 ""Carry me"" was released as an advance of their fourth studio album through Island Records. ""Luna"" was the second single to be extracted from the album ""So long, see you tomorrow"" which coveted the band their first UK number 1.

After a long 6-year hiatus, the band made a comeback in 2020 with ""Everything Else Has Gone Wrong"", their fifth record. The album was released on January 16th via Mmm... Records, with eleven tracks.

""We’re thrilled to say that our 5th album, Everything Else Has Gone Wrong, is out now.

When we started discussing the possibility of making another record after our a few years away as a band, we said we’d only release an album if we were confident that it stood up to our previous work. We’ve ended up with an album we’re really proud of, and we hope you agree that it’s been worth the 6-year wait.

Recording this one was definitely one of the most enjoyable recording processes we’ve had as a band. Working with John Congleton, we had an initial session in London in early Spring last year at Konk studio, where we’d done our first and fourth albums. We then went to LA in late Summer to record the majority of it with John. Spending 3 weeks in LA was an unforgettable experience for the four of us. It was the first extended period of time we’d spent together in a long while and reinforced what we’d been missing during these few years. We hope that positive energy that was there during those 3 weeks has translated onto the record.

We’ve touched previously on how the album is about the comfort that music can provide in times of need. Hopefully, this record can give you that escape should you ever need it.

We want to get to as many places as possible to play these new songs for you. Wherever you are in the world, fingers crossed we’ll see you soon.

Lots of love

Woodson Black, the artist behind Haux, was born and raised in the Berkshires, Massachusetts, where he was collectively raised by his mother and her five sisters. The family faced challenges such as cancer, substance abuse, and tragic losses, which had a profound impact on Haux's life and musical expression.

After attending Northeastern University in Boston, Black pursued an internship at a record label in London, England. There, he immersed himself in the music scene, exploring various aspects such as writing, photography, and composing. Haux began his career by recording tracks and sharing them on SoundCloud, eventually releasing his first digital EP, ""The Bluest Sage,"" on December 8, 2014. In 2016, he released his debut physical EP, ""All We've Known,"" on Akira Records, drawing comparisons to artists like Bon Iver, C Duncan, and Benjamin Francis Leftwich.

Over the following years, Haux continued to release dreamy singles such as ""Touch,"" ""Youth,"" and ""Cologne,"" which were later compiled into his 2018 EP, ""Something to Remember."" However, during a European tour after the EP's release, Haux experienced severe anxiety, prompting him to take a break from music and confront his formative trauma.

On July 17, 2020, Haux released his debut full-length album, ""Violence in a Quiet Mind."" The album delves into the themes of family struggles with substance abuse, trauma, and the importance of confronting personal demons for healing. Through introspective and deeply personal songs, Haux reflects on the loss of loved ones, particularly his aunts, and the generational struggle with addiction within his family.

The album was recorded on the Isle of Harris in Scotland, a place significant to Haux's mother, creating an isolated and emotionally charged environment for channeling his feelings. Co-produced by Jamie Macneal and Thomas Bartlett, the album maintains an intimate atmosphere that captures the raw emotions and vulnerability of Haux's storytelling.

Haux hopes that ""Violence in a Quiet Mind"" will spark conversations about mental health, addiction, and the importance of honesty and empathy. By sharing his own experiences and struggles, Haux aims to provide solace and support for listeners as they confront their own challenges and seek healing from past traumas. The album invites audiences on an intimate and contemplative journey, encouraging self-reflection and embracing the power of healing through music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/HAUX"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A flagship year for Raine was capped off in December, when she performed live with soundtrack legend Hans Zimmer at The Game Awards, the video game industry's flagship annual award show (Celeste was nominated for four awards, and won two).

His output is relentless, his imagination; boundless. For a musician so unconstrained by style, one moniker would never suffice. Enter Dan Kye: Jordan’s stripped back electronic alias. 

In 2016, Jordan Rakei released his first Dan Kye project: Joy, Ease, Lightness, a 4 track EP aimed squarely at the dancefloor, but with a meditative awareness that reaches far beyond the club. He would then follow this up four years later with his debut full-length album under the name called Small Moments. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Kye"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

142,caribou,1282121,42461740,"There is more than one artist with this name, including: 
1) Caribou is Canadian Dan Snaith (b. 1978); 
2) Caribou was a French band active in the 1970s; 
3) Caribou is a New Zealand band from Dunedin/Ōtepoti.  

1) Caribou is Canadian Dan Snaith (born Daniel Victor Snaith on 29 March 1978), who formerly recorded under the moniker Manitoba. Known for altering his sound with each subsequent release, he incorporates electronic psychedelia, krautrock rhythms, and breakbeat drums and creates a swirling, lush, musical panorama. Snaith also creates more club-oriented dance music under the name Daphni. 
Snaith grew up in Dundas, Ontario, Canada, which gave its name to a song from his debut album Start Breaking My Heart. He studied at the University of Toronto as an undergrad, but was based in the UK for several years until he completed his Ph.D. in mathematics at the Imperial College, London in 2005. 
Snaith previously recorded under the stage name ""Manitoba"", but changed it under threat of a lawsuit by Handsome ""Dick"" Manitoba, frontman for The Dictators, a punk-rocker with an appetite for litigation. Uninterested in the legal stoush, Snaith is quoted saying that he chose the new moniker ""Caribou"" while on an LSD trip with friends in the Canadian wilderness. He then climbed a tree and didn't come down until he finished his first album under the new moniker, which was four months later. 
He has recorded five full-lengths: Start Breaking My Heart, a jazzy, ""folktronica"" IDM album, Up in Flames, the critically acclaimed shoegazer with analog synths and sometimes live, sometimes sampled drums, The Milk of Human Kindness, his krautrock-inspired album that bleeds 70's prog and 70's drugscapes, the psychedelic pop record, Andorra which landed him the prestigious 2008 Polaris Music Prize on September 29th, 2008 and Swim a disco / dance inspired album created from the idea of making dance music that sounds like being under water. A few years prior to the recording of the album, Snaith's wife gave him swimming lessons as a Christmas present, prompting him to take it up as a new hobby. This partially led to the eventual ideology behind Swim. 
His eclectic live performances are renowned, in part for their use of simultaneous drummers and synchronised visuals.  The live band currently consists of Dan Snaith (guitar, keyboards, vocals, drums, flutophone), Ryan Smith (guitar, keyboards), Brad Weber (drums) and John Schmersal (bass, vocals). 

2) Caribou was a French band active in the 1970s. The band released ""Californie"" in 1977. 

3) Caribou is a New Zealand band from Dunedin/Ōtepoti.  The band released their debut single, ""Big 18"", in 2023. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Caribou"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Una combinación explosiva. En 2019 Mateo vuelve quedar en boca de todos con “La mexicana”, un single que al ritmo de una ranchera rockera aborda el desamor y se sigue acercando al oido popular. Su búsqueda se profundiza en “Cabildo y Juramento”. Audaz e intensamente contemporáneo, el álbum es una radiografía de estos años, signados por una exaltación amorosa y una efervescencia juvenil que se escucha en cada tono del álbum. Conociendo Rusia se encuentra en un gran momento artístico y se posiciona como uno de los referentes más fuertes de la escena del nuevo rock argentino. En los últimos años se consolidó en Argentina con un público que no para de crecer.

147,marina,1722500,124452469,"There are several artists with this name: 

1) Marina Lambrini Diamandis, known mononymously as Marina and previously by the stage name Marina & the Diamonds, is a Welsh singer and songwriter.

Born in Brynmawr to a Welsh mother and Greek father, Diamandis was raised in Abergavenny and moved to London as a teenager to become a professional singer, despite having little formal musical experience. In 2009, she came to prominence upon placing second in the BBC's Sound of 2010. Her debut studio album, The Family Jewels (2010), incorporated indie pop and new wave musical styles. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number five and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. The album's second single, ""Hollywood"", peaked at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart. Her follow-up record, Electra Heart (2012), was a concept album about a character of the same name which became her first number one project in the United Kingdom. The album was certified gold in the US and UK, with its singles ""Primadonna"" and ""How to Be a Heartbreaker"" becoming international hits.

Diamandis' synthpop-inspired third studio album, Froot  (2015), became her third top 10 album in the UK and her first top 10 entry on the US Billboard 200, where it charted at number 8. Produced entirely by Diamandis and David Kosten, it was praised for its cohesive sound and introspective lyrical content. Her fourth studio album, Love + Fear, was released on April 26, 2019. The album charted at number five on the UK album chart. She released her fifth studio album, Ancient Dreams in a Modern Land, on June 11, 2021 which charted at number 17 in the UK.

2) Marina Lima started her career in the 1980's using the stage name Marina. Since the 90's she has been using Marina Lima on all of her releases. Lima is a widely popular brazilian singer-songwriter.

Starting her career before brazilian rock of the '80s was commercially ripe, Marina Lima witnessed its creation from a privileged standpoint and participated in it as a successful pop star since 1984. Her most regular partner has been her brother, poet and philosopher Antônio Cícero. Her biggest hits are ""Fullgás"" (Marina/Antônio Cícero), ""À Francesa"" (Marina/Antônio Cícero), ""Pra Começar"" (Marina/Antônio Cícero), ""Nada Por Mim"" (Herbert Viana/Paula Toller), ""Eu Te Amo Você"" (Kiko Zambianchi), ""Ainda É Cedo,"" ""Não Sei Dançar,"" and ""Uma Noite e Meia."" Her eclectic repertory features rock-tinged pop-dance music, blues, bossa nova, a typical samba-canção melancholy, and a very tiny pinch of jazz.

From five to 12, she lived in the USA where her father worked, and was taught to read in English before Portuguese. Attracted to psychoanalysis and music, Marina Lima (just Marina by then; she added her surname to her stage name in the '90s) started to write songs, opting for making a living in this career when Gal Costa recorded her ""Meu Doce Amor"" in 1977. The next year she formed a band that had a drummer who would be connected with the creation and the development of the Brazilian rock of the '80s, Lobão. Ricardo Barreto (guitar), Guto Barros (guitar), Zé Luís (sax), and Junno Homrich (bass) would also participate in that historic moment (they later became musicians of the seminal Brazilian rock band Blitz) as they were also in her band before the new genre took Brazil. Marina's first solo album, Simples Como Fogo (1979), already brought originals in the pop/rock style that would become mainstream in the next decade. But her first hit came in 1984, with ""Fullgás,"" which had success with the title track ""Me Chama"" (Lobão) and ""Mesmo que Seja Eu"" (Roberto Carlos/Erasmo Carlos, here having its meaning altered as a confession of her bisexuality). Three years later, she appeared in the film Rádio Pirata (Lael Rodrigues) singing the main theme, which she also composed. With 15 albums released in Brazil as 2000, others were launched especially for the American market and dominated a period in which anxiety provoked a loss of voice; Marina Lima is one of the biggest divas of Brazilian rock.

3) Marina Luchenko-Szczesna (Polish: Marina Łuczenko-Szczęsna; Ukrainian: Марина Лученко–Ще́нсний; born 3 July 1989), known mononymously as Marina (stylized as MaRina), is a Ukrainian-Polish singer-songwriter and actress. 

4) Marina Vénache, known as Marina on stage, is a French singer born on October 30, 1985. She started her career in the sixth season of the TV show ""Star Academy"" in 2006. 

5) Marina Marqueza (currently using the name Marqueza) is a non-binary Japanese-Venezuelan artist, singer, and producer based in Salt Lake City, Utah making genre-fluid music from the bottom of their heart. They want to see the Salt Lake City art scene become more radically inclusive of the diversity of talent that already exists, and they put that intentionality behind every event they agree or refuse to be a part of. Marina loves Existimos, Patty and Graciela, and she wants to perform a set that is affirming and healing from their place as a queer person of color. Her debut album, Orbit Pluto, was released on January 1, 2019. 

6) Marina, a Czech metalcore band from Prague.

7) Marina Nakamura(中村 真里奈, Nakamura Marina, born February 7, 1987) is a Japanese singer and songwriter from Miyazaki who is signed to 5pb. Marina debuted in 2010 singing songs for the anime television series Angel Beats! as one of two vocalists for the fictional band Girls Dead Monster.

LaMontagne has released eight studio albums, Trouble, Till the Sun Turns Black, Gossip in the Grain, God Willin' & the Creek Don't Rise, Supernova, Ouroboros, Part of the Light, and Monovision. He was born in New Hampshire and was inspired to create music after hearing an album by Stephen Stills. Critics have compared LaMontagne's music to that of Otis Redding, The Band, Van Morrison, Nick Drake and Tim Buckley.

Early life
LaMontagne was born in Nashua, New Hampshire, in 1973, one of six children raised by his mother. In his early teens he lived in Morgan, Utah, and was more interested in drawing images of Dungeons & Dragons than in his school work. After graduating from high school, LaMontagne moved to Lewiston, Maine, and found work in a shoe factory. LaMontagne also spent a significant amount of time in Wilton, Maine. Other sources state that by his teen years he was living in Maine, spending time in Turner and Buckfield.

Style
LaMontagne has a unique vocal style which he says is created by singing through his gut instead of through his nose. He cites Stephen Stills, Richard Manuel, and Rick Danko as strong musical influences while critics have compared LaMontagne's music to that of The Band, Van Morrison, Nick Drake, and Tim Buckley.[failed verification] A Rolling Stone review of his album Supernova referred to his voice as an ""impeccably weathered tenor croon"" and his phrasing as ""marble-mouthed.""

Awards
For his debut album, LaMontagne won four awards, including three Boston Music Awards (Best Male Singer-Songwriter, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year) and an XM Nation Music Award for Acoustic Rock Artist of the Year. LaMontagne has received a nomination from the Pollstar Concert Industry Awards for Best New Touring Artist, the BRIT Awards for International Breakthrough Act, the MOJO Awards for Best New Act, and was given the title of Best Voice in 2006 by Esquire.

In 2011, Ray LaMontagne and the Pariah Dogs received two Grammy Award nominations, and they were awarded the Grammy for the Best Contemporary Folk Album for God Willin' & the Creek Don't Rise.

Controversy
On July 23, 2014, during a show at the Meijer Gardens in Grand Rapids, Michigan, LaMontagne interrupted a song and walked off stage as a result of two fans talking during his concert, after having previously asked the audience to quiet down. The incident included yelling profanity at the couple before walking off stage. Once the couple was escorted away LaMontagne continued the concert.

On September 20, 2016, LaMontagne announced that he was canceling a September 22 show at the Bass Concert Hall at the University of Texas at Austin, due to Texas's recently implemented campus carry law.

Personal life
In 2009, LaMontagne paid $1.05 million for a 103-acre farm in Ashfield, Massachusetts, the former residence of U.S. Ambassador William C. Bullitt, where he lives with his wife, Sarah Sousa, and their two children in the farmhouse built in 1830. Sousa is a published poet via Red Mountain Press and their sons are budding artists. He refers to himself as a ""very private person"" and rarely gives interviews. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ray+LaMontagne"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

155,beta radio,285671,2026614,"Beta Radio is an American band from Wilmington, North Carolina. The group consists of Benjamin Mabry and Brent Holloman. Stylistically, their music features an amalgam of folk, indie, chamber pop, rock and Americana influences.

Musically reminiscent at times of Bon Iver’s atmosphere heavy For Emma, Forever Ago or the Grateful Dead’s “Mountains of the Moon” from their 1969 release Aoxomoxoa, the sonic landscape of the band's album Seven Sisters is sparse but far from empty.  On tracks like “Khima,” “Borderline” and “Brother, Sister,” the slow scrawl of the banjo melody floats through the song and surrounds you like birdsong, coming at you predictably but surprisingly from several directions at once.  Each of the songs on this album stays with you, forming a soundtrack for and changing the shape of the rest of your day.

It’s appropriate that a debut album concern itself with creation and Seven Sisters is no exception.  Whether it is the creation of love and a place for that love, as the narrative of the album suggests; or the creation of the universe, as the album’s title and repetition of astronomical and astrological imagery suggests; Beta Radio’s lyrics and music carve out a space in your head and find a way to fit into your own cosmology.

Lyrically, Seven Sisters explores religion, albeit from a couch rather than a pulpit.  The religious allusions are subtle and unobtrusive, concerning themselves more with mysticism than proselytization, much like David Eugene Edwards’ 16 Horsepower and Wovenhand.

Line for line, the lyrics are beautiful and surprising.  In “A Place for Me” the lines “I wanted not to fight / With my heart but I’ll fight with my fists all night” evoke the heartache of leaving, of lovers’ spats of loss and regret.

The album leaves you with a simple but urgent lyric refrain in “Return to Darden Road”– “Where do you go? / Come back to me / ‘Cause I love you so.” Review by deckfight <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Beta+Radio"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

156,grandson,679367,19666359,"Grandson is an alternative artist hailing from Toronto, Canada. Born in the small town of Englewood New Jersey, he relocated to the cultural melting pot of Toronto at a young age, and grew up surrounded by music ranging from jazz to rock and roll to rap, dancehall and r&b. He began playing guitar and piano in high school.

At 17, he relocated to Montreal, QC to attend university, and began working in nightclubs cleaning tables and DJing. He started writing music at this time, incorporating the unique blend of sounds he grew up surrounded by. He started experimenting with music production and rapping in 2013, and dropped out of school to relocate to Los Angeles and pursue music full time.

Adopting the Grandson moniker while living in LA, he dove deeply into rock influences such as Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana, and Led Zeppelin, while also listening to rap/R&B music emerging out of Toronto and alternative acts such as Twenty One Pilots and Hiatus Kaiyote. He found a small community of musicians to work and perform with here in Los Angeles. The live tries to create a frantic, mosh pit-inducing cathartic release of energy for concert-goers, influenced by early punk and grunge music.

Searching for his voice and for meaning in today’s divisive, chaotic world, Grandson confronts the most pressing issues of his generation through his songwriting, such as financial inequality, governmental and environmental accountability, and social justice, giving these topics a soundtrack with a genuine sense of urgency and frustration. The music also touches on adolescence, relationships, and the insecurities and difficulties of growing up through your 20s. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Grandson"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

159,miami horror,723338,12456351,"Miami Horror are an Australian indie-electronic band from Melbourne, Australia (with the name referring to producer, Benjamin Plant, and to the four-piece live incarnation). Beginning in  2007 under the moniker Miami Horror, Plant started with a series of remixes. The debut release came in 2008 with a five-track EP, Bravado, on Virgin Records. The live show has Plant augmented by Josh Moriarty (Peacocks, ex-Young & Restless) (guitars), DJ/producer Aaron Shanahan (drums), and Daniel Whitechurch (bass, keyboards, and guitars).

After years in the making here at last is Illumination, the fully realised debut album from Melbourne's favourite psychedelic indie-electronic adventurers Miami Horror. With Illumination, Miami Horror has delivered on two years of teeth-cutting live shows and an ever escalating wave of buzz that’s made the group bonafide blog darlings the world over. But what’s most amazing about the grand arrival of Illumination is that the roots of the record stretch back countless moons to when Miami Horror began as just one synthesizer-obsessed producer in 2007 huddled over a laptop in a bedroom-come-studio and the album itself just a spark waiting to be lit.

The afore mentioned synth tragic was, and let’s face it still is, electronic young gun Ben Plant, who kick started Miami Horror out of a love of Roland keyboards and French house, landing himself on Pitchfork’s hot-list overnight and copping a barrage of high profile remix requests from the likes of Datarock, PNAU and The Presets.

Yet it was while Ben was punching out 2008’s epochal Bravado EP that Miami Horror took off in a completely new and different direction. Characteristically wanting to flex his creative muscle and avoid the limitations of being stereotyped as simply a dance or electro act, Ben rewired Miami Horror’s genetic makeup, deputising the talents of Josh Moriarty, Aaron Shanahan and Daniel Whitechurch to form a new live band persona of Miami Horror, a whole new beast immeasurably more exciting than before.

“It started out that I didn’t want to have any guitar on the album besides a little funk guitar or disco bass,” Ben grins while explaining the turning point for Miami Horror’s evolution. “But then Josh came in and started playing all these other parts that sounded amazing. Paired with what I was working on, nobody was doing anything like it, so I knew we had to turn those sounds into a live thing and just go wild.”

It worked. Since the switch, Miami Horror has launched into dizzying new stratospheres, their well-polished chops as a group making for some unmissable sets at Australia’s biggest festivals, and that’s not to mention some A-list support slot call ups for everyone from Phoenix, Friendly Fires and La Roux to a hand-picked hook up from Lily Allen.

165,wallners,45449,377145,"he amazing dream pop of four Viennese siblings is called: Wallners
Had they not grown up under one roof, the four Wallners, Nino, Max and the twins Anna and Laurenz, would never have ended up in a band; so they tell us with a laugh. Daft Punk as their favourite band is about the only thing they can agree on -and they are already working on tracks that would make the two French electronics legends dance. At the moment though, the music of the newcomers Wallners is much more reminiscent of the soundtrack to a daydream, which entices you into mystical parallel worlds and that lets feelings set the pace, especiallythe feeling of longing. Wallners evoke the gentle, seductive sounds of Rhye, the heartbreak of a James Blake and a Lana Del Rey in the way they work and remind us of two other siblings that are on everyone’s lips: Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas. Due to their closeness and familiarity Wallners also don’t have to discuss much with each other; they understand each other blindly and produce at home.

But the four Wallner siblings do have something in common: they are all great tinkerers & creative minds who work on individual songs for up to a year -not so much by adding layer to layer, butquite the contrary, by exposing the core of the songs. It is a music of reduction, of condensed, substantial minimalism. Carried by Anna Wallner’s hypnotic voice, Wallners prove that tenderness and force don’t have to be mutually exclusive. The songs envelop the listeners, who immediately get carried away by the arrangements, just like with a lullaby. The Wallners are excited to present their amazingly dreamlike music to the world. Their first EP is called “Prolog 1” and is out now, on Universal Music Austria. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Wallners"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Shanice Green pours pure, unfiltered ""soul"" into her listeners hearts. She has managed to find a sweet spot between acoustic soul, blues, and ""folky-pop"" that sits just right. While Shanice accompanies herself expressively and rhythmically on acoustic guitar, it's her rich, euphonious vocals that truly heal hearts.

It was on a trip to her hometown of Easton, Texas where Shanice found the inspiration for her most recent songs. The quiet simplicity of the country fields, front porches, and dirt roads brought her back to her blues roots. She returned to her current home of Atlanta, Georgia with songs inspired by listening to Bobby Bland, Johnnie Taylor, and Jimmy Reed. Though listeners often compare her to the likes of India.Arie, Corinne Bailey Rae, and Tracy Chapman, Shanice credits artists such as Jason Mraz and Jack Johnson as musical influences. Shanice's ""charismatic personality, and smooth, soulful voice"" will be put on display this summer as she hosts several intimate acoustic shows, and releases live versions of her new songs.

173,vansire,1434224,31111397,"Vansire is a dream pop band from Rochester, Minnesota consisting of Josh Augustin and Sam Winemiller. They are currently signed to Spirit Goth Records. Vansire has performed at ROCKChester and First Avenue, played a live session with Audiotree, and collaborated with artists such as Chester Watson, Jeremiah Jae, and Mick Jenkins.

Vansire formed as band members Josh Augustin (vocals, synths, guitar, and drums) and Sam Winemiller (bass, guitar, and synths) were attending Century High School in Rochester, Minnesota. Augustin and Winemiller met while playing together on the school's drumline and continued to find themselves performing together through school activities (such as concert band and pit orchestra), something the duo says contributed to their creative synergy and friendship, which later helped in Vansire's formation.

In the summer of 2015, Winemiller approached Augustin after practice for the school's drumline with an idea to make a band ""that sounds like Mac [DeMarco]"". The pair's early recordings were made by holding instruments to the internal microphone of an iPad running GarageBand. Augustin and Winemiller, initially unsure of what to call their new project, turned to an online random word generator that landed on ""vansire"", an alternative name for the Marsh mongoose. From there, the two continued to record together in their basements, living rooms, and bedrooms under the new Vansire moniker.

In August 2016, Vansire self-released their first album, ""Reflections and Reveries"". The duo recorded the album entirely in Winemiller's basement in a roughly one-year period from August 2015 to August 2016, and included Winemiller's brother, Issac, on bass for some songs.

During this time, Augustin began studying at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and Oberlin College, while Winemiller started at the University of Minnesota. Despite the distance, the duo vowed to remain committed to the Vansire project, now describing it as ""a long-distance band relationship.""

Vansire released their second album Angel Youth in April 2018 on Spirit Goth Records. Augustin and Winemiller produced and mastered the album themselves, and it is the band's first full-length album that featured collaborations with other artists.

In June 2019, the duo released their single ""Metamodernity"", also recording an Audiotree Live session at Audiotree's studios in Chicago later that August.

In July 2020, Vansire released ""Central Time"", a single featuring Chicago-based rapper Mick Jenkins in their first collaboration together. In an interview announcing the single, Augustin said the single began as an instrumental demo that Winemiller sent him in September 2019, which sat untouched for roughly eight months until the duo returned back to it, finishing it up at the beginning of June 2020.

During this period of the band's history, Augustin said that Vansire found itself leaning in an ""increasingly dance-oriented direction"" with regard to musical sound and that the duo has started to draw influence from more ""dancey, funk-imbued music"".

On October 16, 2020, Vansire released ""After Fillmore County"", a seven-song EP that brought back FLOOR CRY, and featured Philadelphia-based rapper Ivy Sole. In April 2021, Vansire released a remix of Sydney-based producer-artist Swaine Delgado's ""F Me Up"", their first remix.

The band's origins trace to their attendance at secondary school and playing together as teenagers. Initial efforts to sign with a label failed, leading to the band's manager Jamie Oborne to form Dirty Hit records.

178,colter wall,333494,10678936,"Colter Wall (born June 27, 1995) is a Canadian singer-songwriter from Swift Current, Saskatchewan. His self-titled debut album was released on May 12, 2017.

Wall was familiar with country music growing up as country artists such as Johnny Cash were played at home. He started learning guitar at the age of 13, playing music of rock bands such as AC/DC and Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. Later he became interested in old blues artists, and then started to listen to folk music. According to Wall, he first heard Bob Dylan's song ""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"" around grade 10 or 11 (aged 15 or 16), and he was inspired to start writing and singing songs instead of only playing guitar. Other early musical influences he cited include Woody Guthrie and Ramblin' Jack Elliott, and he had also expressed interest in country singers such as Gram Parsons, Townes Van Zandt, George Jones, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Hank Williams. He made demos of his songs while he was a student, and in 2015, he decided to take a break from his studies at the university to focus on his music career when his first EP was released.

Colter Wall was born in Swift Current, Saskatchewan, the middle child of Tami and Brad Wall, 14th Premier of Saskatchewan. He has two sisters, Megan and Faith. Wall attended Swift Current Comprehensive High School, and graduated in 2013. He then studied at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon.

Wall recorded a seven-song EP, Imaginary Appalachia, in 2015 with Jason Plumb the producer at Studio One in Regina, Saskatchewan. He collaborated on the EP with other artists from Regina such as Belle Plaine and The Dead South. He described his music as a blend of blues, folk and Americana. The EP was released on March 9, 2015, and ""The Devil Wears a Suit and Tie"" was released as his first single. His music gained the attention of Brock Lesnar who helped to raise his profile among wrestling fans. Songs from the album were featured in the television show Dog the Bounty Hunter,[8] and the films Hell or High Water and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. The track used in the films, ""Sleeping on the Blacktop"", gained more than a million streams on Spotify.

In 2016, Wall opened for Lucinda Williams at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. He was signed to Rick Rubin's American Songs publishing company.

His first full-length album, self-titled Colter Wall, was produced by Dave Cobb at the RCA Studio A in Nashville. Wall was accompanied by Cobb on acoustic guitar, Chris Powell on drums, Mike Webb on piano, and Robby Turner on pedal steel. The album was released on May 12, 2017 and according to Wall, most of the songs on the album are autobiographical.

A new album, Songs of the Plains, was announced in July 2018 and was released on October 12, 2018. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Colter+Wall"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Now based in Louisville, Kentucky, Tomberlin released her debut full-length album, ""At Weddings"", in 2018 on Saddle Creek Records. She wrote most of At Weddings while living with her family in southern Illinois during her late teens and early twenties. At 16, she finished her homeschooling curriculum and went to college at a private Christian school she describes, only half-jokingly, as a ""cult."" By 17, she had dropped out of school, returned home, and begun to face a period of difficult transition in her life. The daughter of a Baptist pastor, Tomberlin found herself questioning not only her faith, but her identity, her purpose, and her place in the world. 

""I was working, going to school, and experiencing heavy isolation,"" Tomberlin says of the time when she first began writing the songs on At Weddings. ""It felt monotonous, like endless nothingness. It was a means to get through to the next step of life."" In songwriting, Tomberlin found relief and lucidity she had trouble articulating otherwise. When she was 19, she wrote ""Tornado"" on her parents' piano, and began to develop confidence in her music. A year later, she had written enough songs to fill an album. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tomberlin"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Born in Milan to Tunisian parents, he has always lived in the Lombard capital, spending a good part of his childhood in Baggio, a neighborhood on the outskirts of Milan.
He began to approach rap with the name Fobia, which later became Ghali Foh. In 2011 he founded the Troupe D'Elite, a group which also included the rapper Er Nyah (now known as Ernia), the singer Maite and the producer Fonzie. In the same year he received a call from the rapper Gué Pequeno, who signed him to his label Tanta Roba. Over time, he also made himself known thanks to Fedez, accompanying him on his tour. The following year he released the EP of the same name with the group: critics defined it as one of the lowest points of Italian rap, the group was considered borderline insane. In July 2013 he published Leader Mixtape, collaborating with artists such as Sfera Ebbasta, Maruego and others. A year later, Troupe D'Elite terminated the contract with Tanta Roba and released the album Il mio giorno giorno as independent artists, as a free download on the Honiro platform.

Since 2015 he has continued as a soloist and changed his name, simply becoming Ghali.

On 14 October 2016, through Sto Records, he released the single Ninna nanna on Spotify which set new streaming records, obtaining the highest number of plays on the first day and reaching first position in the Top Singles only thanks to streaming listening, given that the artist decides not to put the single on sale in digital music stores.

195,deftones,3396137,378322133,"Deftones is an American  alternative metal band from Sacramento, California, formed in 1988, consisting of Chino Moreno (lead vocals and guitar), Stephen Carpenter (guitar), Frank Delgado (keyboards and turntables), and Abe Cunningham (drums and percussion). Vega (formerly of Quicksand) took on bass duties from mid-2009 to ca. 2021 in substitution for Chi Cheng, who was seriously injured in an automobile accident in Santa Clara, California on November 4, 2008. Cheng remained in a coma until his death on April 13, 2013, due to cardiac arrest. Fred Sablan is their current live bassist starting in 2022. Lance Jackman plays guitar during non-US shows since Stephen Carpenter no longer travels abroad as of 2022.

While they were mostly an alternative metal band in their early years, their sound changed into something more complex and experimental in 2000, as a result, they are often coined today as an alternative rock band. 

Critics have often praised them as one of the closest to unique rock bands of recent years for their innovative, atmospheric music; as Johnny Loftus writes, ""Rock critics usually reserve a special place for Deftones above or at least away from the rest of the turn-of-the-century metal movement [...] Deftones have always seemed more curious, more willing to incorporate traditionally revered sounds like dream pop and DC hardcore into their Northern California alt-metal.""

Frontman Chino Moreno’s poetic lyrics—described by a Time magazine critic as “fiercely intelligent”—are often evocative, yet are sparse enough to allow for multiple interpretations. Moreno has cited Morrissey, Weezer’s Rivers Cuomo, The Cure’s Robert Smith, and Depeche Mode’s David Gahan among his favorite singers, and beyond an occasional similarity in vocal technique, these singers’ sweeping sense of drama and delicate vulnerability is often evident in Moreno’s vocals.

Deftones members have worked on several side projects, including Moreno’s Team Sleep and drummer Abe Cunningam’s Phallucy. Guitarist Stephen Carpenter works with a group called Kush, featuring members of Fear Factory and Cypress Hill. Turntablist Frank Delgado has a DJ crew with DJ Crook of Team Sleep, DJ Julez, and Matt D called Decibel Devils.

* Chino Moreno (vocals, guitar)
* Stephen Carpenter (guitar)
* Abe Cunningham (drums)
* Chi Cheng (bass, backing vocals)
* Frank Delgado (turntablist/keyboardist/sampler)

(Incidentally, Carpenter is generally credited with “strings”, though if he actually plays anything other than electric guitar it’s not immediately apparent. This most likely refers to his abuse of the guitar strings, making screeching noises inbetween playing riffs.)

Early years: 1989-1993
When Carpenter was 15 years old he was hit by a car while skateboarding. This left him confined to a wheelchair for several months. It was at this point that he began teaching himself guitar by playing along with bands such as Anthrax, Stormtroopers of Death and Metallica. It has been reported that the driver paid Carpenter a cash settlement that allowed the band to purchase equipment, but drummer Abe Cunningham commented in an interview that this was ""a myth about how our band was started.""

Carpenter, Moreno and Cunningham went to the same high school. They were childhood friends and remained friends through the skateboarding scene in Sacramento. When Moreno found out Carpenter played guitar, he set up a jam session with Cunningham and the three began playing regularly in Carpenter's garage circa 1988. After playing with several bassists, the band settled on Justin Jaramillo and recorded a four track demo soon after. Within two years the band began playing club shows and later expanded their playing territory to San Francisco and Los Angeles where they played shows alongside bands such as Korn. While closing for another band in L.A., after the majority of the audience had left, the band impressed a Maverick Records representative. They were soon after signed to the label after showcasing three of their songs for Freddy DeMann and Guy Oseary.

The name ""Deftones"" was created by Carpenter who wanted to pick ""something that would just stand out but you know, not be all cheese-ball at the same time."" Carpenter combined the hip hop slang term ""def"", which was used by artists he listened to such as LL Cool J and Public Enemy, with the suffix ""-tones"", which was a popular suffix among 50s bands whose music he also enjoyed (e.g. Dick Dale and the Deltones; The Quin-Tones, The Monotones, The Cleftones and The Harptones). Carpenter said the name is intentionally vague to reflect the band's tendency to not focus on just one style of music.


Adrenaline: 1994-1996
The band's debut album, Adrenaline, was recorded at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington and released on October 3, 1995. It was produced by Deftones and Terry Date, who would go on to produce the band's next three albums. Initially unsuccessful, extensive touring, word-of-mouth and Internet promotion built the band a dedicated fanbase, as well as helping Adrenaline to sell over 220,000 copies without the singles ""7 Words"" and ""Bored"" (as well as their music videos) receiving any airplay. The band contributed the non-album track ""Teething"" to the soundtrack for the 1996 film The Crow: City of Angels and are also seen performing the song live during one of the film's scenes.

The album spent 21 weeks on the Billboard Heatseekers chart reaching a peak position of 23. When asked what he attributed the album's success to, Cheng responded, ""One word: perseverance. We've been together for almost eight years, on the road for two and we do it with honesty and integrity - and the kids can tell."" The album was RIAA certified gold on 7 July 1999 in recognition of 500,000 units sold.

Regarding the recording of the album, Abe Cunningham said, ""At the time we did the first record - which I really like and think is good - you can tell the band was really young. We'd been playing most of those songs for quite a while, and we were just so happy to be making a record that we didn't really think a whole lot about making the songs better."" Moreno felt that Adrenaline was recorded ""really fast""[ and performed all his vocals live with the band in the room using a hand-held Shure 58 microphone. A review of Adrenaline praised the album's musical control, precision, overall groove and Cunningham's ""surprisingly sophisticated drumming"". It was also noted that ""there is a bit of sameness in Chino Moreno's whispered vocal melodies, which drags the record down a bit.""

Deftones' second album, Around the Fur, was recorded at Studio Litho in Seattle, Washington and produced by Terry Date. Released on October 26, 1997, the album included a collaboration with singer Max Cavalera (of Sepultura/Soulfly/Cavalera Conspiracy) on ""Headup"", a tribute to Cavalera's late stepson Dana Wells, to whom the album was also dedicated. Although not yet a member of the band, Delgado is credited as ""audio"" on five of the album's tracks and Cunningham's wife, Annalynn, provides guest vocals on ""MX"".

""When we went in to make this record, we really didn't have a set idea of what we wanted to come out with,"" said Moreno in a 1998 interview with Chart magazine. However, he felt that the album ""fell into place"" once the band had settled into the studio. The band expanded its sound, spending more time with Terry Date, and giving more thought to the album's production. Cunningham varied his drum sound and experimented by using different types of snare drum on almost every track. The album was praised for its loud-soft dynamics, the flow of the tracks, Moreno's unusual vocals and the strong rhythm-section grooves created by Cheng and Cunningham. Stephen Thomas Erlewine's review noted that ""while they don't have catchy riffs or a fully developed sound, Around the Fur suggests they're about to come into their own.""

The album was highly anticipated and propelled the band to fame in the alternative metal scene on the strength of radio and MTV airplay for the singles ""My Own Summer (Shove It)"" and ""Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)"". Around the Fur sold 43,000 copies in its first week of release, and entered the Billboard 200 at number 29 (its peak position), remaining on the charts for 17 weeks. The band went back to touring, making appearances at the Warped Tour (in the United States, New Zealand and Australia), Pinkpop Festival, Roskilde Festival and Ozzfest as well as releasing a live EP on June 22, 1999. Around the Fur went on to reach RIAA gold status on June 24, 1999.


White Pony: 2000-2002
On June 20, 2000, the band released their third album, White Pony, again produced by Terry Date and Deftones. It was recorded at The Plant Studios in Sausalito, California and at Larrabee Sound Studios, West Hollywood, California. The album debuted at number three in the US Billboard chart with sales of 178,000 copies. Delgado (DJ Speedboat) was now a full-time band member, adding new elements to the band's music. The melancholy ""Teenager"", for example, was a radical departure in style and mood, a ""love song,"" according to Moreno, which incorporated elements of glitch and trip hop, with programming duties carried out by Moreno's friend and side-project Team Sleep bandmate DJ Crook. A collaboration with singer Maynard James Keenan of Tool is present on ""Passenger"", and the refrain in ""Knife Party"" features vocals by Rodleen Getsic. Moreno had also started contributing additional guitar on several tracks.

An interview with the band in Alternative Press explained the recording process of White Pony. After a break from touring, the band spent four months in the studio writing and recording White Pony, the longest amount of time they had dedicated to an album thus far. Moreno explained that the majority of this time was spent trying to write songs, and that the writing of ""Change (In the House of Flies)"" was the turning point where the band began working as a group. Despite being pressured to release the album sooner, the band decided to take their time making the album. Cheng explained that ""We didn’t feel like we had anything to lose, so we made the record we wanted to make."" Moreno did not have a common theme in mind lyrically, but made a conscious decision to bring an element of fantasy into his lyrics, explaining that ""I basically didn’t sing about myself on this record. I made up a lot of story lines and some dialogue, even. I took myself completely out of it and wrote about other things.""

Reviews were generally positive, noting Moreno's increasing sophistication as a lyricist and the group's experimentalism. Of White Pony, one reviewer wrote that ""Deftones went soft, but in an impressive way, to twist around its signature punk sound.""

The album was originally released as an 11 track version beginning with ""Feiticeira"" and ending with ""Pink Maggit"" and featuring gray cover art. A limited edition print of 50,000 black and red jewel case versions of White Pony were also released at the same time with a bonus 12th track entitled ""The Boy's Republic"". Later, the band released ""Back to School (Mini Maggit)"", a rap-influenced interpretation of the album's closer, ""Pink Maggit"". ""Back to School (Mini Maggit)"" was track 11 on the leaked pre-release version of White Pony in April 2000, but not included on the original (official) issue of the album in June 2000. The leaked version of White Pony also included the slower version of ""Pink Maggit"" which appeared on the first official White Pony CDs. That song was listed as a bonus track (track 12) on the leaked pre-release version.  The song was picked up as a single and placed as the new opening track (with ""Pink Maggit"" still the closer) of a re-released White Pony on October 3, 2000 featuring altered white cover art. Not entirely happy with re-releasing the album, the band negotiated to have ""Back to School"" made available as a free download for anyone who had already bought the original album. Chino noted that ""Everybody's already downloaded our record before it came out anyway, otherwise I'd be kind of feelin' like, 'Man, why [are] we putting [out] all these different versions of the record?' [...] that's the best way we can actually get this song out to the people who already purchased this record, for free basically. And if they wanna buy the record again, it's cool.""

White Pony achieved platinum status, selling over 1.3 million copies in the US, and earning the band a 2001 Grammy award for Best Metal Performance for the song ""Elite"".


Deftones: 2003-2005
Deftones began work on their fourth album under the working title Lovers. Regarding the album's direction, Cheng commented that ""We've proven that we can musically go in any direction we want, and we want to get kind of heavy on this one."" Moreno underwent vocal training as a precaution after severely damaging his vocal cords on the band's 2001 summer tour. The band converted their rehearsal space in Sacramento into a fully equipped studio and recorded most of the album there at negligible cost. The band brought in Terry Date to assist with production, and also received input on musical arrangement from Greg Wells on several of the album's tracks. The band later added more material at Studio X in Seattle, WA and at Larrabee Studios in West Hollywood, CA. Overall the album took twelve months and cost roughly $2.5 million to produce with the band being fined by Maverick for missing deadlines.

In January 2003, Deftones left the studio to perform some ""one off"" shows in Australia and New Zealand as part of the annual Big Day Out Festival. Shortly after, the band returned to the studio to finish their fourth album. The self-titled Deftones was released on May 20, 2003. Deftones entered the Billboard 200 at number two and sold 167,000 copies in its first week. The album remained in the Billboard top 100 for nine weeks, supported by the first single, ""Minerva"". The band shot a video for their second single, ""Hexagram"", with fans watching the band play the song in an indoor skatepark in Simi Valley, California. The band made a video for the track ""Bloody Cape"", but it was never released for play on television. The video was only made available on the band's official website for one day. It was later released on their B-Sides and Rarities DVD.

Reviews were mainly positive, praising the band for the heavy album's progression and originality in the midst of declining creativity in contemporary metal. Moreno was quoted as saying, ""It's all on record. We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren't going to be with them."" In reviewing Deftones, Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes that ""Hexagram"", the album's opener, ""hits hard — harder than they ever have, revealing how mushy Staind is, or how toothless Linkin Park is,"" but also goes on to say that the album ""sticks a little too close to familiar territory."" The Onion's A.V. Club similarly called the album ""less rewarding than its predecessor, though its peaks rival any in the genre.""

The band released a compilation album titled B-Sides & Rarities on October 4, 2005. The CD includes various b-sides and covers from throughout their career, while the DVD contains behind-the-scenes footage and the band's complete videography up to that point.


Saturday Night Wrist: 2006-2007
 Deftones performing live in Glasgow, June 2006.The band's latest album, titled Saturday Night Wrist, was released on October 31, 2006. It debuted at number ten in the US Billboard chart with sales of just over 76,000, a significant decrease on the first week sales of their two previous releases.

Rather than work with longtime producer Terry Date, Deftones decided to record with Bob Ezrin. Cunningham says that while the group enjoyed working with Date, ""At this point, we just needed to change things up [...] And this is definitely a different style. Working with him [Ezrin] is just putting us fucking upside down. He's cracking the whip.""[45] After recording all the instrumentals for the record, Chino Moreno decided to record his vocals separately. Chino thus finished recording the album with former Far guitarist Shaun Lopez as producer. Collaborations on the record include Annie Hardy from Giant Drag on the song ""Pink Cellphone"" and Serj Tankian from System of a Down on the track ""Mein"".

The album's first single was called ""Hole in the Earth"", hitting the radio on October 16, 2006. ""Hole in the Earth"" was also featured as a downloadable song for the PS3 & Xbox 360 versions of Guitar Hero 3. ""Mein"" was the album's second single, which aired in Spring of 2007.

As of March 2007, Saturday Night Wrist has sold over 250,000 copies (US).

Deftones spent the majority of 2006 and 2007 touring around the world in support of the album. The band played shows in places including North America, Canada, Europe, South America, Japan and Australia. The band also performed in such tours as Taste of Chaos, Family Values Tour and the Soundwave Festival in Australia.


Eros: 2008-2009
Deftones are currently in the studio writing and recording their next release, Eros, which will once again utilize the production services of Terry Date. Deftones have been writing the album since Fall 2007. As of December 7, 2007, six to eight songs were finished and the album is expected to be released in the winter of 2008. Chino Moreno has described the album as weird, unorthodox, featuring a lot of atmosphere and soundscaping, and having ""fuck you, I hope you die!"" style aggression. He has also stated that he won't be contributing on guitar, instead focusing on his vocals, and will leave guitar duties entirely to Stephen Carpenter. Carpenter will be utilizing his signature 8-String guitar, the ESP Stef B-8. They started recording the album on April 14th, 2008.

Moreno stated that this album would be more up-tempo (as far as the drumming is concerned), going on to say that the past couple of albums have been more mid-tempo; that Abe Cunningham has been playing faster. He also referred to the album as being ""snappy"". Moreno stated in an interview that the process for this album would be more raw and simplified after dissatisfaction with the long and ""pieced-together"" experience of recording Saturday Night Wrist.

On January 14th, Chino Moreno posted an instrumental electronic beat that sounds similar to Team Sleep called ""You've Seen The Butcher"", on the Deftones' MySpace page, and announced in a bulletin that the album would be called Eros, the Greek word for ""love."" It was also announced that Eros would be released by Reprise Records, the first time Deftones have released an album not affiliated with Maverick Records.

On September 18, Deftones played a secret show at the Spaceland Club in Los Angeles. The band played a new song entitled Melanie, which they also played at the previously announced headlining show at the Ventura Theater in Ventura, California on September 19 and also at the KUPD's End of Summer Scorcher on September 20 in Peoria, Arizona, where they co-headlined with Alice In Chains.

Also, recently Deftones have been posting a number of videos on MySpace and their blog, documenting the recording process of Eros.

On November 4, bassist Chi Cheng was seriously injured in a car accident in Santa Clara, California. Chino Moreno posted on the band's blog, saying, ""It deeply saddens me to inform you all that our brother Chi Cheng was involved in a terrible car accident last night. He is currently in a Northern California hospital in serious, but stable condition. I am on my way up north right now to be by his side, along with the rest of our bandmates and family. Chi is one of the strongest people I know, and I'm praying that his strength will get him through this. Please say a prayer for him as well.""[47] Following the accident, Cheng's bandmates and mother, Jeanne, began using the Deftones blog to post updates on Cheng's condition. In a post dated November 18, it was stated that ""Chi's condition remains the same - serious, but stable. He still lies in a coma, however his vitals (heart, lungs, and blood pressure) all exhibit very stable functions and doctors have begun removing much of the excess monitoring equipment."" In a blog posted dated November 9, it was reported that Chi was attended by three off-duty EMTs who happened upon the accident scene. The post goes on to state that ""If not for them, the chances of Chi making to the hospital alive would have been poor."" On December 9, it was announced that Chi had been moved into the care of an unnamed hospital that ""specializes in the care and management of traumatic and non-trauma related brain injuries"".

Diamond Eyes: 2010-2011
It was announced that the new album would be titled ""Diamond Eyes"", to be released May 18th, 2010.

All together Diamond Eyes Has sold 62,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release to debut at position No. 6 on The Billboard 200 chart. 


 Koi No Yokan: 2012
On March 29, 2012 an interview with Stephen Carpenter was posted on ESP Guitars's YouTube channel. In it, Carpenter talks about his switch to 7-string and 8-string guitars. At the end, he says, ""Musically, me and my band, Deftones, are working on a new record and we hope to have it finished and out by Summer of 2012, and when the new record's done we'll start another touring cycle and get out there and play our stuff for those who are interested.""
Chino Moreno has also stated that it has resemblance to their 2000 record, White Pony, when it's compared to their previous work. “The songs are very different from each other, not heavier or slower, but more dynamic, going towards several directions, it’s heavy, but beautiful.” In addition, it has been reported that Nick Raskulinecz will return to produce their seventh effort, which is, as of yet, unnamed.
On April 3, 2012 after performing at the Quilmes Rock 2012 festival, Chino was interviewed about Crosses and the new Deftones record. He said that the writing process was completed last week and they start recording after he gets back from South America. ""We start recording next week. I love it, I'm so excited about it because Deftones, obviously, that's my life, I've made a career since I was fifteen years old and right before I came last week we finished all the writing so, next week, when I get back, we start recording. We should have a record that comes out in the early Fall, maybe October. Maybe September."" 

The album was released through Reprise Records on November 12, 2012, in the UK and November 13, 2012, in the United States. Band frontman Chino Moreno characterized the album as ""dynamic"" with a full range of sound, noting that more contributions were made to the album from bassist Sergio Vega compared to their previous record, Diamond Eyes. On September 19, 2012, the band released the song ""Leathers"" as a promotional single via a free download on their website. On October 8, 2012, ""Leathers"" was released as the album's first single.

""Tempest"" was released as a single on October 9, 2012.

Its release was met with critical acclaim, debuting at number two on the US Billboard 200, it is the band's fifth album to debut within the chart's top-ten and is their highest-charting since their 2003 eponymous album.The album was noted for its creative tension between frontman Chino Moreno and lead guitarist Stephen Carpenter, which was described by Rolling Stone as Moreno ""playing Morrissey to the guitarist's Meshuggah""

 Ohms: 2020
is the ninth studio album by American alternative metal band Deftones, released on September 25, 2020, through Reprise Records. Musically, Ohms has been described as an alternative metal and dream pop album. It is the first Deftones album since their eponymous 2003 album to be produced by Terry Date, although the last time the band had worked with him was during the sessions of the unreleased album Eros in 2008. It is also their first album on which Stephen Carpenter utilizes a nine-string guitar

 White Pony x Black Stallion: 2020
If we go by the wisdom that album anniversary celebrations tend to be the last refuge of the dying creative force, then there was never any reason for Deftones to mark the 20th birthday of ‘White Pony’ this year. In September, the titanic ‘Ohms’ extended to ten years and four albums one of the most remarkable runs of any band this century; a brooding modern masterpiece, it confirmed that they remain close to the peak of their powers as they enter into the fifth different decade of a career that began in 1988. Still, many of their fans continue to contend that ‘White Pony’ is their finest moment, and as a nod to that, the group have finally realised what presumably seemed like a good idea when they first had it; a remix album, originally inspired back in 2000 by frontman Chino Moreno’s love of DJ Shadow’s ‘Endtroducing…’ Shadow himself is one of eleven artists to step up to the plate on ‘Black Stallion’, chipping in with a irritatingly glitchy take on ‘Digital Bath’. The bulk of the record is similarly throwaway; Clams Casino strips down ‘Feiticeira’ so far past its bare bones as to be beyond recognition, Salva’s choppy reimagining of ‘RX Queen’ fails to properly translate the urgency of the original, and Purity Ring’s spacey ‘Knife Prty’ falls awkwardly halfway between cover and remix.
The low point is a new version of ‘Passenger’ from Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda, a baffling choice to begin with given how unfairly ‘White Pony’ was so often lumped in with the nu metal of the time. In fact, though, ‘Passenger’ does not nod to ‘Hybrid Theory’ or even 'Meteora', but instead to Shinoda’s more recent work, meaning no guitar, a boring synth loop and horrible, pseudo-AutoTuned vocals. There are occasional flickers of inspiration - see the maximalist rework of ‘Elite’ from Blanck Mass and the minimalist ‘Teenager’ that Robert Smith contributed - but otherwise, you have to hope that everybody involved enjoyed putting Black Stallion together, because it ain’t much fun to listen to. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Deftones"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Her seamless meld of dreamy indie pop and confessional alt-country invokes names like Angel Olsen, Sharon Van Etten, and Caitlin Rose, Julia Jacklin was raised in a family of educators in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales. Upon discovering Britney Spears at the age of ten, and eventually Avril Lavigne and Evanescence in high school, Jacklin decided to shift her focus from a future social work to a career in music. As her tastes changed, so did her songwriting style, and by her twenties she was drawing from a much deeper well of artistic expression, citing artists like Fiona Apple, Anna Calvi, and Appalachian folk trio Mountain Man as inspirations.

By day, Jacklin was working in a factory that made essentials oils, and by evening, she was honing her skills on-stage and in the studio. A pair of singles, ""Pool Party"" and ""Coming of Age"", drew praise both in Australia and in the U.K., and in 2016 she released her debut full-length, Don't Let the Kids Win, via London-based indie label Transgressive in the U.K. and Polyvinyl in the U.S.

Though his name is sometimes assumed to be a pseudonym due to its similarity to German composer Kurt Weill, it is in fact his birth name, as given by his parents Donna and Charles Vile.

Vile began his musical career in 2003 creating lo-fi home recordings with frequent collaborator Adam Granduciel. The duo subsequently formed the indie rock band The War on Drugs in 2005. Vile departed following the release of their debut studio album, Wagonwheel Blues, in 2008.

Vile's music has been likened to Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, and Tom Petty. His first album for Matador, titled Childish Prodigy was released in October 2009. Prior to signing with Matador, Vile released two albums, God Is Saying This To You and Constant Hitmaker, on Mexican Summer and Woodsist, respectively. He plays both solo shows as well as shows with a backing band called The Violators.

213,tycho,1031208,37633181,"
Scott Hansen (born February 7, 1977), professionally known as Tycho, is an American ambient music artist and producer, who is known as ISO50 for his photographic and design works. Tycho is currently signed to, and has released under, Ghostly International, but has also released music on Merck Records and Gammaphone Records. His song, Dictaphone's Lament, was used as the track on a music video entitled ""Live Life to the Fullest"", which was made by and featured on the action cartoon block Toonami. Additionally, his song Cascade (originally made for an Adult Swim/Ghostly International compilation) was played during the final moments of the original 11-year run of Toonami in 2008.

Hansen began releasing music over 10 years ago with The Science of Patterns EP. His first full-length, Sunrise Projector, came out in 2004, and as the critical acclaim continued in 2006 with the release of Past Is Prologue.

It was around 2008 that URBmagazine noted Tycho as one of the Next 100 artists to watch, and Hansen continued to release singles and experiment with more live instrumentation. In 2011, his meticulous process saw the release of Dive, his debut full-length for Ghostly International. Tranquil, nostalgic and melodic, the record established him beyond the realm of IDM and ambient.

Now with Awake, Tycho's second Ghostly LP, the project returns as a true three-piece band comprised of Zac Brown (guitar, bass) and Rory O’Connor (live drums). Lengthy touring for Dive brought Tycho to its full potential, and in efforts to capture the energy on the road Hansen invited Brown and O’Connor in to the creative process.

216,fleet foxes,2286301,103274811,"Fleet Foxes is an American indie folk band formed in Seattle, Washington in 2006. The band consists of Robin Pecknold (vocals, guitar), Skyler Skjelset (guitar, mandolin, backing vocals), Casey Wescott (keyboards, mandolin, backing vocals), Christian Wargo (bass, guitar, backing vocals) and Morgan Henderson (upright bass, guitar, woodwinds, violin, percussion, saxophone).

Led by singer-songwriter Robin Pecknold, the band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP Sun Giant and their debut album Fleet Foxes on Sub Pop. Both received critical praise and reviewers often noted the band's use of refined lyrics and vocal harmonies. Fleet Foxes' second studio album Helplessness Blues was released on Sub Pop in 2011. Following a hiatus between 2013 and 2016, during which Pecknold pursued an undergraduate degree, Fleet Foxes reunited to record their third album, Crack-Up, released on Nonesuch Records in 2017. The band's fourth album, Shore, was released on Anti- in September 2020.

Formation and early years (2005–06)
Robin Pecknold and Skyler Skjelset both attended Lake Washington High School in Kirkland, a suburb of Seattle, and soon became close friends. Pecknold and Skjelset bonded over an appreciation of Bob Dylan and Neil Young and began making music together. Their parents influenced their musical tastes early on—Skjelset's mother Peggi was a keen listener to both Dylan and Hank Williams while Pecknold's father Greg was a member of The Fathoms, a local 1960s soul group. The two shared an interest in the music of Dylan and Brian Wilson. Pecknold played bass for Seattle's Dolour on a US tour in 2005, shortly before forming the first incarnation of Fleet Foxes.

Originally going by the name ""The Pineapples"", a name clash with another local band prompted a change and Pecknold decided upon ""Fleet Foxes"", suggesting that it was ""evocative of some weird English activity like fox hunting"". Pecknold took up the role of principal songwriter, both singing and playing guitar, while Skjelset played lead guitar. The original lineup was filled out by Casey Wescott on keyboards and backing vocals, Bryn Lumsden on bass and Nicholas Peterson on drums and backing vocals.

Pecknold's late-sixties pop style caught the attention of the Seattle producer Phil Ek and he helped them record their first demo in 2006, the self-released Fleet Foxes EP. Ek was impressed with the band's songwriting, and on hearing Pecknold for the first time, noted, ""It was obvious he had talent coming out of his ass."" By late 2006 the Seattle press began to take notice of the band; Tom Scanlon of the Seattle Times stated that he was impressed with the band's lyrics and musical maturity. By the end of the year, Lumsden had been replaced on bass by Craig Curran, who would also handle many of the band's vocal harmonies.

With growing popularity on the local circuit, the band set about making their first album in early 2007, spending time in the studio with producer Ek in addition to recording material at home. However, funds for recording were tight, so the band members cobbled together what funds they had, which limited the time they had in the studio, and so the majority of the tracks were recorded in various band members' apartments, other spaces, or the basement of Pecknold's parents' house.

Sun Giant and Fleet Foxes (2007–08)
Fleet Foxes were becoming increasingly popular and by late 2007, they had attracted over a quarter of a million song plays over two months on their Myspace site. Although the band had not released any of their recordings, they benefited from word of mouth exposure and their success soon translated into a record deal, signing with Warner Music subsidiary record label Sub Pop on January 18, 2008. According to Sub Pop's A&R, Sue Busch, at the time of signing the band was still a relatively primitive set-up, being without manager or legal representation. Robin's sister Aja Pecknold then assumed the role of band manager. The band's frontman, Robin Pecknold, attributes much of their success and popularity to illegal file sharing.

The band tracked their second EP, Sun Giant, at Bear Creek Studio and performed overdubs and mixed at Seattle's Avast! Recording Co., around the same time in preparation for upcoming tours. Fleet Foxes began their spring tour with another Northwest band Blitzen Trapper on February 28, 2008. Before the recording of the EP, bassist Curran was replaced by Christian Wargo, whose voice, like that of his predecessor, would become an important part of the band's harmony blend. The band's performances, first at the SXSW festival in March 2008, and then the Sasquatch! festival in May 2008, moved the band into the public consciousness, notably attracting attention from the European press for the first time.

Sun Giant was released internationally on April 8, 2008 and the group's brand of folk, rock and pop, marked by their use of vocal harmonies, was well received by the press. Despite the warm critical reception, the group said that the EP did not represent their full ambitions, serving merely as a CD to sell while on tour. In May 2008, the band chose to extend their North American and European tour until September in support of their forthcoming album. At this time Josh Tillman replaced Peterson on drums and backing vocals. Their first full-length album, Fleet Foxes, was released shortly afterwards on June 3, 2008. The album achieved similar critical success as the previous EP. Fleet Foxes received four out of five stars from Rolling Stone, which compared it to the likes of the Beach Boys, Animal Collective, and Crosby, Stills & Nash, and a 9.0 out of 10 in a review by Pitchfork Media, sharing the website's album of the year rank with the Sun Giant EP. The Guardian was particularly complimentary, awarding the album five stars and declaring it ""a landmark in American music — an instant classic"". On June 24, 2008, Fleet Foxes went to No. 1 on the CMJ Radio 200 Chart. The album achieved an average rating of 87/100 from 30 critic reviews on the aggregator website Metacritic.

While the group enjoyed moderate success in the United States, Fleet Foxes was better received in Europe, selling over 200,000 copies in the five months following its release. The sales were matched with critical plaudits and their debut album won Uncut's first ever Music Award 2008 prize. Uncut's editor, Allan Jones, said the album ""showed impeccable musicianship, and although you could trace its antecedents, it sounded totally unique. Fleet Foxes was just a glorious debut."" The band sold out music venues for their tours of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, reaffirming their growing popularity.

At the end of 2008, Fleet Foxes was rated album of the year by Billboard's Critic's Choice and in Metacritic's end of year best album round-up it appeared in 17 lists, topping six of them. Furthermore, it had sold over 408,000 copies in North America and over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom, making it the first gold certificate record for UK label Bella Union. Their growing profile enabled the band to make televised appearances, playing on Vincent Moon's La Blogotheque in December 2008 and on Saturday Night Live the following January. In 2009, they toured in Europe to favorable reviews; the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said their show in Paradiso induced goosebumps. In 2008 and 2009, the band played globally ending the tour in September with a final European leg.

Helplessness Blues (2009–12)
Pecknold said that he would have liked the album to be released in 2009; however, the band's touring schedule delayed rehearsals of the new songs until February 2009. These sessions took place in a rented house outside Seattle, but were mostly scrapped, losing the band $60,000 of their own money. Further delays ensued because the drummer, Tillman, was scheduled to play a solo tour in Europe and North America throughout the 2009–10 winter. Pecknold later sent some demos to producer Phil Ek and expressed the hope that the second LP would emerge in late 2010.

In December 2009, Pecknold said he wanted the new LP to sound ""less poppy, less upbeat and more groove-based"". He referenced the 12-string guitar sound from Roy Harper's folk album Stormcock, saying, ""That will be the primary sonic distancing from the last record."" He wanted the band to record very quickly, with ""vocal takes in one go, so even if there are fuck-ups, I want them to be on there. I want there to be guitar mistakes. I want there to be not totally flawless vocals. I want to record it and have that kind of cohesive sound. Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, to me, is the best-sounding album because it sounds like there were only six hours in the universe for that album to be recorded in. So I want it to have that feeling."" The band eventually began recording in April 2010 in various locations (including West Hurley, New York) under the label Reciprocal Recording and decided to scrap the earlier idea of a fast recording (though according to the band many of the initial vocals were done in one take). The album features a new six-piece band line up, with the addition of the former Blood Brothers bassist Morgan Henderson on upright bass and woodwind instruments.

The album, Helplessness Blues, was released on May 3, 2011 with a cover illustrated by the Seattle artist Toby Liebowitz and painted by Christopher Alderson. The title track was released via free download on January 31, 2011, and the album's fourth track, ""Battery Kinzie"", was premiered in the UK on Zane Lowe's radio show on March 22, 2011. The Sub Pop record label released a downloadable music video of the track ""Grown Ocean"", with footage of the album's recording, on its website in support of the album. A 12"" vinyl double A-side single of ""Helplessness Blues"" and ""Grown Ocean"" was released for Record Store Day on April 16, 2011. On November 1, 2011, Pecknold's brother, Sean Pecknold, released the official music video for ""The Shrine / An Argument"".

Helplessness Blues was nominated as Best Folk Album at the 2012 Grammy Awards, held February 12, 2012.

Departure of Tillman and hiatus (2012–2016)
On January 18, 2012, after the band had finished touring for the album, drummer Tillman announced that he had left the band. He would go on to reinvent himself and record several albums as Father John Misty, notable for his ironic sense of humor in lyrics and media as well as often criticizing both the record industry and society in interviews and on stage.

In October 2020, Pecknold reflected on Tillman's departure during a Reddit AMA: ""[Josh] ""quit"" the band after recording drums for Helplessness, got into narcotics and made his first Father John Misty album while I was making Helplessness in Seattle. Then Sub Pop offered to put out his album, but only if he delayed it for a year or so and toured Helplessness with us. Which we all weakly agreed to going through with, but it quickly became obvious he'd rather have just been doing that project instead, and I would have rathered that as well. So that tour I had to endure being around a lot of substance abuse, sabotaged shows, just general ill treatment, shit-talking, all while paying him for songs he didn't have anything to do with. It sucked!""

On June 15, 2013, an image of a home recording set-up–including a laptop computer, microphone and guitar–was posted on the Fleet Foxes Facebook page with the caption ""Step one"". On June 16, 2013, an image of a broken mandolin with the caption ""Step two"" was posted. These images were later deleted, but led to speculation that the group was working on a new project, possibly a third studio album. On April 23, 2014, Robin Pecknold posted to the band's Facebook page that he had moved to New York to get his undergraduate degree at the Columbia University School of General Studies, a liberal arts college of Columbia University in New York City.

Crack-Up (2016–2018)
On May 18, 2016, while answering fan questions on his Instagram account, Pecknold confirmed that Fleet Foxes were working on new material with drummer and frequent collaborator Neal Morgan, best known for his work with Joanna Newsom and Bill Callahan. Describing Morgan as a ""full Fox"", Pecknold also admitted he ""had to up my songwriting game for homeboy."" However, when Pecknold posted a photo of the band minus Morgan on Instagram, he clarified that Morgan was one of three drummers involved in the new album, and that for the time being Fleet Foxes would consist of Pecknold, Skjelset, Wescott, Wargo, and Henderson as a ""five-piece 'core band'"", but they would still use a drummer for live performances and additional musicians for certain shows. Pecknold also said that the new material would be ""a different vibe"" compared to Fleet Foxes' previous output. On November 14, 2016, the band confirmed (via their Facebook account) that their new album was nearly complete.

On December 25, 2016, Pecknold posted a photo on his Instagram account which showed four albums in the Fleet Foxes' queue in his iTunes library: the first studio album Fleet Foxes; the Sun Giant EP; the second studio album Helplessness Blues; and an unknown third album entitled Ylajali. This led to speculation that the band's third album would: 1) be named after a character from Knut Hamsun's novel Hunger; 2) contain a photo from Japanese photographer Hiroshi Hamaya as the cover art; and 3) be released through Nonesuch Records, since the label's logo can be seen on the album cover.

In an email newsletter on January 1, 2017, production company Mason Jar Music confirmed that Fleet Foxes was working on a new album, since they contributed to the production. The album was called Crack-Up, after an F. Scott Fitzgerald essay of the same name. The album is a concept album and was recorded at Electric Lady Studios and Sear Sound in New York City.

On March 7, 2017, Fleet Foxes announced their third studio album, Crack-Up, released on June 16, 2017 via Nonesuch Records, a new label for the band. The lead single, ""Third of May / Ōdaigahara"", was released the same day. On April 4, 2017, the band posted the album trailer for the new album on YouTube. The trailer briefly presents various songs from the album and shows some images while they were recording them. The video was made by Sean Pecknold, Robin's brother.

On May 15, 2017, Fleet Foxes made their live return at the Wilma Theatre in Missoula, in which they performed nine songs from Crack-Up along with a selection of older material and a cover of ""In the Morning"" by Bee Gees. The band's current live line-up includes Matt Barrick of The Walkmen, who is also the most heavily featured of the three guest drummers who contributed to Crack-Up. Barrick has continued to play with the band, but has not become an official member. The new album also included the sounds of a brass quartet called The Westerlies.

On October 10, 2017, the band announced the release of a new EP, entitled The Electric Lady Session, for Black Friday Record Store Day 2017. The EP was released on November 24 of that year, and is a collection of live performances of four songs from Crack-Up, originally recorded for their session at Fordham University’s radio station WFUV. For Record Store Day 2018, the band released another EP, entitled ""Crack Up (Choral Version)""/""In The Morning (Live in Switzerland)"", in collaboration with the Icelandic female choir, Graduale Nobili.

Shore (2019–present)
On December 31, 2018, Pecknold teased several new demos online for an upcoming new album.

If his first projects embraced indie electro influences, he then explored soul and indie pop on his first album Hundred Fifty Roses, produced in collaboration with Crayon. This album is a turning point in Duñe's career, as he not only co-produced all the tracks, but is also the main vocalist on the whole album. This project is also the occasion for Duñe to make his first strong collaborations: FKJ (as a producer), Ichon, Aurélie Saada, Swing ...

Following this release, Duñe wished to evolve towards an even more personal sound highlighting his vocals, and leaving room for his hip hop and r&b influences which were existing in a more subtle way until then. Thus, he collaborated with several artists such as Swing & Angèle, Ehla or Ichon with whom he built a strong musical universe by working on productions as well as toplines. 

Duñe has been at the same time working on his next solo project, an EP influenced by North American pop, hip hop and r&b sounds which were always significant to Duñe.

224,dewolff,78330,1512069,"DeWolff are a psychedelic rock band from The Netherlands’ deep south, formed in 2007 by brothers Pablo and Luka van de Poel and Robin Piso. 

When their psychedelic yet hard rocking, self-titled EP was released in 2008 it immediately conquered the hearts of rock music lovers all across the country and in December 2008 the band played their first show at Paradiso, a legendary venue in Amsterdam. The release of their 2009 debut album “Strange Fruits and Undiscovered Plants” was followed by a successful tour through the Netherlands and Germany. In 2010, then still aged 15, 18 and 19, DeWolff played in front of an audience of 10,000 at Europe’s oldest music festival Pinkpop.

In late 2010 DeWolff recorded their second album “Orchards/Lupine”. This record was released in January 2011 and immediately made it to #11 in the Dutch album charts, a huge accomplishment for a young alternative rock band in nowadays’ musical climate. The tour that followed the release of “Orchards/Lupine” completely sold out and in August 2011 DeWolff played in front of an audience of 15,000 at the Hungarian Sziget festival and in front of 30,000 people at the Dutch Lowlands festival.

A film crew had followed the band from the release of their debut album until the Sziget performance and in May 2012 the resulting documentary “DeWolff” was premiered at the Amsterdam International Documentary Festival. One month later DeWolff’s third studio album, entitled “DeWolff IV”, was released. As well as some electrocuted, hard rocking tunes, this album also featured a twenty-minute rock opera. DeWolff’s live reputation grew bigger and bigger and their highly energetic concerts, which by now had lead them to France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Russia and even Australia, proved DeWolff to be one of the best and wildest live bands in their league. 

In search of the sexy Southern swagger to be heard on those old Southern Rock and soul records that by now had become a great influence on DeWolff’s new material, the band travelled to Valdosta, Georgia in early 2014 to record their next album with Grammy award-winning producer Mark Neill. The resulting album GRAND SOUTHERN ELECTRIC sounds like a classic: this album shows a perfect blend of great songwriting and next level riffery on a foundation of some of the grooviest drum grooves known to man and topped by a great vocal performance reminiscent of Leon Russell in his early days. The Grand Southern Electric tour will doubtlessly lead these three wolf men to your town, so make absolutely sure not to miss it! <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/DeWolff"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After the three founding members originally met in high school, a bassist and a drummer were found, and they all moved to a house in Silver Lake in 2008 to record their album. Their debut album as Local Natives, ""Gorilla Manor"", was released in the UK on November 2nd, 2009, and saw a US release date of February 16th, 2010. The band's sound has been described as ""afropop-influenced guitars with hyperactive drumming and hooky three-part harmonies"". They started to attract the attention of the music press after playing nine shows at the 2009 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Initial reviews of Local Natives have drawn favourable comparisons to Arcade Fire, Fleet Foxes and Vampire Weekend.

Utilizing lots of vocal harmonies and drifting, dreamlike melodies, Local Natives have an intricate sound based around the delicate interconnectedness of all of their parts. This gives the band a sound that is able to be orchestral while still feeling understated, evoking the carefully assembled pop of Grizzly Bear. Their debut, Gorilla Manor, arrived in 2009 through U.K. label Infectious Records (with a domestic release coming by way of Frenchkiss in 2010). In 2011, Andy Hamm left Local Natives, leaving them to continue on as a quartet. In 2013, the band returned with its sophomore album, Hummingbird, featuring the single ""Breakers"".

With urgent delivery and gloriously widescreen production, Carner confronts both the deeply personal (“You can’t hate the roots of a tree, and not hate the tree. So how can I hate my father without hating me?) and the highly political (“I told the black man he didn’t understand I reached the white man he wouldn’t take my hand”). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Loyle+Carner"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

239,caloncho,125921,2089312,"Óscar Alfonso Castro (born December 20, 1986 in Obregón, Sonora), better known as Caloncho, is a Mexican musician and singer.

As a child, Caloncho lived in Guadalajara where his favorite activity was playing the drums, until he later decided to experiment with melody. At the same time, he started playing the guitar that his grandfather had left for him years before, and soon learned to play songs from artists such as Bob Marley and Sublime.

Based on his own confession, Caloncho was the name his grandfather and step-sister, Angélica, used to call him when he was very little and since the name never annoyed him, he decided to use it as his musical stage name.

His first EP ""Homeotermo"" was recorded in 2011, and soon after, he started working with músician Siddhartha (a former-teacher and friend). He asked him to be his producer and Siddhartha agreed, saying about him: ""Caloncho is a newly born musician, he is being newly discovered, both by himself and by those around him. He sent me a sample of his music and I immediately felt it was a musical obligation to help extract the sweet juice from his fruitful melodies."" (Caloncho's website).

Caloncho then released his second EP, titled ""Fruta"" (Fruit), in September 2013. This production mixes his unique musical style with rhythms and stories of Mexican national folk, beaches, and forest rhythms, as well as urban sounds. All these sounds are used to retell different situations from his own life.

""We experimented a lot during the creation of the EP. We used organic sounds and objects that are not considered musical instruments, such as water, fruit, seeds, lighters, etc. I love it and I want to hear it"", he said.

Calancho has admitted that thanks to music, he has been able to live his life through all his senses. Music has also allowed him to feel completely connected with his family. ""My dad would write and play songs for us, and he would invite us to build on them, as a way to be in communion with each other,"" he's said.

In 2015 he published the LP, ""Fruta Vol. II"" (Fruit Vol. II), a production worked with certain arrangements.

He was nominated for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.

242,molchat doma,859002,25758240,"Молчат Дома (English translation: The Houses Are Silent)  is a Belarusian post-punk band with lyrics sung in Russian. Currently a trio with Egor Shkutko on vocal duties, Roman Komogortsev on guitar, synths, and drum machine, and Pavel Kozlov on bass and synths. The trio have been dubbed “the Belarusian New Order of our generation”, but that’s not quite right – they have far more in common with the gloomy nihilism of that band’s forebearer, Joy Division, a bleak, claustrophobic quality that’s like sinking into a pool of tar. Formed in 2017, in their hometown of Minsk, the trio take inspiration from early 80s post-punk and new wave, a visceral, intense mix of metallic drums, ominous synths, and melancholic bass lines. Some tracks sound like they were conceived using basic Casio keyboard presets; others borrow from Krautrock’s motoric grooves. But all burn with a deep seated despair and frustration, Yegor Shkutko’s vocals sounding anguished and distant. The sparse, cold production of second album Etazhi also sounds oddly futuristic, the crushing soundtrack to some dank, cyberpunk dystopia.Their second LP, Этажи (pronounced Etazhi, meaning “Floors”) was released in 2018 on Berlin-based Detriti Records. It has sold out four times and is currently on its fifth repressing due to outstanding demand. Этажи has garnered over one million views on Youtube. Despite playing to packed clubs in Warsaw, Helsinki and Berlin, they are still flying under the radar in their native Belarus. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Molchat+Doma"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Armed with solid training and raw talent, they mix and combine their different musical backgrounds. Their complex arrangements, inspired by both classical and modern composers, are particularly striking to hear and see during their live shows. Devon Portielje’s remarkable voice is beautifully backed up by Connor Molander and Dylan Phillips. Phillips often plays drums and keys simultaneously as Molander and Portielje shuffle between guitar, keys, samplers, and percussion folky three-part harmonies hold down moody, psychedelic arrangements and electronic-infused soundscapes. They have recently welcomed a 4th member on stage, multi-instrumentlist Isaac Symonds, who adds his voice as well as playing guitar, keyboards and percussions. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Half+Moon+Run"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

257,henry jamison,207032,1743239,"Vermont singer/songwriter Henry Jamison comes from an ancestry of writers and composers, making him a natural fit for the brand of thoughtful, literate indie folk he creates. Throughout the latter half of the 2010s, the New Englander delivered a succession of well-received singles and independent albums like 2017's The Wilds and 2019's Gloria Duplex. Taking a more collaborative approach, he began working with artists like Darlingside on 2020's ""I Forget Myself"" and Maisie Peters on 2022's ""Make It Out.""

Growing up in Burlington, Jamison was surrounded by music from a young age. His father is a classical composer and one of his ancestors is the popular Civil War era songwriter George Frederick Root. After stints in college, folk choirs, and various bands, Jamison set about demoing a handful of solo songs on an old Korg 8-track recording his father gave to him. After a bit of polish, those demos became his debut EP, 2016's The Rains, a warm set that melded folk guitar, lyrical introspection, and understated electronic flourishes. Jamison returned in early 2017 with a pair of singles, offering a new original tune, ""The Jacket,"" as well as his modern take on Gordon Lightfoot's ""If You Could Read My Mind."" In October of that year, he delivered his first full-length release, The Wilds, which was followed in early 2018 by The Wilds Quartets, an EP of three songs from that album arranged with a string quartet. Throughout the early part of 2019, Jamison issued a string of thoughtful singles like ""Gloria"" ""Boys,"" both of which appeared on his sophomore album Gloria Duplex, later that year.

Heading into the next decade, Jamison called on an array of collaborators from the folk and indie rock world to help with his next project. The result was 2020's Tourism, a five-song EP that featured contributions from artists like Darlingside, Joseph, and Fenne Lily. The collaborations continued, first with 2021's ""To Ash"" featuring Nico Muhly, and 2022's ""Make It Out"" with Maisie Peters. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Henry+Jamison"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

258,peach pit,875549,34947682,"There are at least 2 bands sharing the name Peach Pit.

1) Peach Pit are a pop band from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The band is led by singer and rhythm guitarist Neil Smith, lead guitarist Christopher Vanderkooy, bassist Peter Wilton, and drummer Mikey Pascuzzi. They describe their own music as ""chewed bubblegum pop"", whereas critics have described their sound as ""sad pop and surf rock"" and has a soft spoken vocal style with guitar driven rock melodies. The band's music videos are produced by videographer Lester Lyons-Hookham. The band have sported the same clothes for every live performance since buying them for their first music video shoot.

The group formed when high school friends, Neil Smith and Chris Vanderkooy, decided to collaborate on a musical project in 2014. Peter Wilton and Mikey Pascuzzi joined them on bass and drums. In June 2016, the band released its debut EP, Sweet FA, produced and recorded by Smith's former roommate Harley Small at The Space Studios in Vancouver BC. They quickly began work on their follow up release and debut LP, Being So Normal. The album was again recorded by Harley Small at The Space Studios  and was released in September 2017 on the Vancouver indie label Kingfisher Bluez.

Vocalist/rhythm guitarist Neil Smith was formerly part of the folk band Dogwood and Dahlia. Smith and bassist Peter Wilton formerly worked as Amazon delivery drivers, guitarist Christopher Vanderkooy worked at a local Vancouver brewery, and drummer Mikey Pascuzzi worked as a carpenter. The band quit their jobs to go on their first tour of North America, Europe and Asia from 2017-2018. They have been touring steadily ever since the release of their debut album.

Peach Pit performed at Bonnaroo, Shaky Knees Music Festival, CBC Music Festival, and Capital Hill Block Party in 2019 and opened for Two Door Cinema Club in a tour of the U.S. and Canada in 2019. The band has mentioned in interviews and during shows that they have recorded a new album.

2) Peach Pit is a 4-piece math/post rock band from Croatia formed in 1994.

The idea of making a band was started by Bruno Vidović and Mihael Bele in 1994, and after few parties, name Peach Pit (after an odd restaurant in the 90210) emerged as a name for a band that would create noise rock on the heritage of Big Black, Killdozer, Scratch acid and others. Peach Pit's first lineup was formed in the autumn of 1994 and it consisted of Mihael Bele on guitar, Bruno Vidović on drums and Branko Beðtak on bass.

First concerts which promoted early materials that featured vocals were loud and genuinely violent and often featured stage acts such as firecrackers, feedback and stage diving, for which they were often discarded as juvenile and abrupted by sound engineers by pulling out of electricity or even police.

By 1996, Peach Pit turned completely instrumental under influence of new music from across the water, and also played a lot of shows, some of them with noted names such as Zeni Geva. In the spring of 1997, Franjo Gluðac (previously from Liquid Light, also instrumental) joined Peach Pit on the second guitar, and his coming also marked departure of Beðtak which left Peach Pit as a three-piece with Franjo and Mihael on guitars and basses and Bruno on drums. Along with that, first compilation appearances were made, and Peach Pit was now open to audiences outside of Zagreb and started making materials for the first release.

Tricky Slaughter Operation cd-r (burned in 100 copies) was issued in the spring of 1998 and featured Tomica Ðãavina of Brassneck on bass (who left after the album was recorded and a short tour) and also Beðtak's guest appearance on one song. It was recorded live during a six month period in Kozmo. During that period Mihael and Franjo were also the guitar part of the Lunar with which Peach Pit shared a practice room.

Next self-release was Autom csep, which was mostly recorded by overdubbing in Kozmo in summer of 1998 and was issued along with Christmas greeting card ep which was recorded later that year. It was followed by a short concert break which was used for making of a first official album, Suspicios Cargo which was recorded in june of 1999 and was issued nine months later on Ivica Barièeviã's Earwing records. Bara also became promotor for most of the Peach Pit's concerts during that period.

Finishing of Suspicious cargo also marked Bruno Motik being recruited on second guitar, which created current lineup that exists since 1999. His coming brought complexity to songwriting and a step toward exploring new techniques which became our trademark since then.

In the summer of 2000, material for a second album (Music for the Fruitcake Generation) was recorded but was lost. That period was marked with heavy concerting which, along with a album material failure brought some problems to the band after which Peach Pit decided to take a one year break in 2001 after which a short European tour in 2003, that featured five-piece with Branko Beðtak(again) on bass, and Bruno Motik on second drums and guitar, took place. Also, Peach Pit also named a genre for the music which they are playing, sport-rock.

Later, in 2004 some of the songs from the lost material were re-recorded in Kozmo using live recording technique directly to tape and are to be released on Interstellar records Supernova 2 compilation. Four new Sport Rock songs have been recorded (26mins) in january 2006 in Kozmo, and are awaiting mix. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Peach+Pit"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
