6,sebastian yatra,531346,11586069,"Sebastián Obando Giraldo (born 15 October 1994), known professionally as Sebastián Yatra, is a Colombian singer and songwriter. He began as a Latin pop artist and has recorded many ballads, but has released several successful reggaeton singles. Yatra is noted for his romantic lyrics, melding traditional lyricism with modern reggaeton influences. He rose to prominence in Latin America in 2016 when he released the hit ""Traicionera"". He has released three studio albums and recorded with artists from a diverse range of musical genres throughout his career.

Born in Medellín and raised primarily in Miami, Yatra began singing at a young age and returned to Colombia to begin his musical career. He achieved breakout success with ""Traicionera"" followed by ""Robarte un Beso"" featuring Carlos Vives. ""Traicionera"" served as the lead single for his 2018 debut album, Mantra, which also featured the single ""Sutra"", featuring Puerto Rican rapper Dalmata. He then released the album Fantasia including the lead single ""Un Año"" featuring Mexican band Reik. He received continued success collaborating with Daddy Yankee, Natti Natasha, and the Jonas Brothers on the bilingual single ""Runaway"".

Yatra's music has been classified as Latin pop, reggaeton, and ballads. According to The Fader, Yatras music lands ""somewhere in between the olden times’ sappy romantics and the new wave’s sensuous vibras.""He is influenced by Latin pop and reggaeton artists Ricky Martin, J Balvin, Juanes, and Reik. In an interview with Billboard, he expressed a desire to collaborate with Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli. Yatra believes that contemporary musicians commit an ""error in associating ballads with boring and slow and old"", and hopes to rejuvenate intererest in ballads for a younger audience.However, his music contains elements of other genres; Desire Thompson of Vibe described his song ""Traicionera"" as a ""trap-EDM blend"".

Despite growing up in Florida and being fluent in English, Yatra sings almost exclusively in Spanish. Yatra explains, “My goal was always to be a singer in Spanish. And I really wanted to understand where I come from and live it. A lot of times I went to Colombia and, even though I spoke Spanish and was always speaking Spanish with my parents, I still felt like an outsider. I wasn’t 100 percent part of it. I wanted to give my roots the importance they deserve. ”His June 2019 song ""Runaway"" was his first foray into bilingual songwriting. In December 2019, he collaborated with South Korean boy group Monsta X for the song ""Magnetic"", which features verses from Yatra in Spanish and a bridge from Monsta X in Spanglish. Sara Delgado of Teen Vogue called the song a ""truly international pop hit"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sebastian+Yatra"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

9,drake,5937684,835585752,"Aubrey ""Drake"" Graham (born October 24, 1986) is an Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and businessman. Drake was an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s. Intent on pursuing a career in music, he left the series in 2007 after releasing his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.

Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum. His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same, were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late and collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of which earned platinum certification in the U.S. His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records. The dancehall-influenced album sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over 10 years. The album's second single, ""One Dance"", topped the charts in several countries, and became his first number-one single as a lead artist. That year, Drake led both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts simultaneously for eight weeks.

Views achieved quadruple platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. It became Drake's best-selling album to date. Its lead single ""Hotline Bling"" peaked at number two on the Hot 100 and received Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song, as well as ""One Dance"" which was proclaimed the song of the summer in 2016.

Early life
Drake attended both Forest Hill Collegiate Institute (left) and Vaughan Road Academy (right) during high school.
Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practicing Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Drake's mother, Sandra ""Sandi"" Graham (née Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. His parents met after Dennis performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he first interacted with Sandra, who was in attendance. He is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day school, and formally celebrated becoming a Bar Mitzvah in a religious service.

Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Dennis' limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the United States until Drake's early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, however, Dennis would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer. His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song titled ""Drake's Dad"". Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell records, which Drake vehemently denies.

Drake was raised in two Toronto neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end until grade six, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighborhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move, Drake replied, ""[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement; my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.""

He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school. He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighborhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighborhood, Drake described the school as ""not by any means the easiest school to go to."" Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background, and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school. He later graduated in October 2012.

Career - 2001–2005: Degrassi: The Next Generation
At 15, eager to begin as an actor, a high school friend introduced Drake to his father, who was an acting agent. The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks a basketball star who became physically disabled after a classmate shot him. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, ""My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV"". He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, returning for sporadic appearances until his character graduated from school. Overall, Drake appeared in a total of 145 episodes.

2006–2009: Early mixtapes and So Far Gone
Lil Wayne, the founder of Young Money Entertainment, would sign Drake to the label in 2009.
After becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as ""pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it."" The mixtape was released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies. In 2007, he released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single ""Replacement Girl"", featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever-unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with ""Replacement Girl"" being featured on the channel's ""New Joint of the Day"" segment on April 30, 2007. The song also saw Drake sample ""Man of the Year"" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including ""Ransom"", ""Forever"", and a remix to ""Brand New"". Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.

In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles ""Best I Ever Had"" and ""Successful"", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs ""I'm Goin' In"" and ""Fear"". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.

Due to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as ""one of the biggest bidding wars ever"". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album titled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means.

Drake then joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of ""Best I Ever Had"" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He underwent surgery later that year.

2010–2012: Thank Me Later and Take Care
Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.

On March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single ""Over"", which peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, ""Find Your Love"", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[76] The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, ""]Care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image]."" The third single and fourth singles, ""Miss Me"" and ""Fancy"" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.

Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.

It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire on May 8, and he had also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.

Beginning his second effort in fall 2010, Drake announced his intentions to allow for Noah ""40"" Shebib to handle most of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me Later, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and others. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be Take Care. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, ""I didn't get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed many of the songs and sonically I didn't get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round."" Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.

In January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie, to focus on the album. ""Dreams Money Can Buy"" and ""Marvins Room"" were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track listing, while ""Marvins Room"" gained Gold certification by the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio. Drake would soon release the song's music video on June 28.

""Headlines"" was released on August 9, acting as the lead single for Take Care. It was met with positive critical and commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12. It was eventually certified Platinum in both the United States and Canada. The music video for the single was released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game in January 2012. ""Make Me Proud"" was released as the album's second single, on October 16. It was the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number nine the following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88. ""Make Me Proud"" soon became Drake's fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.

Prior to the album's release, Drake had planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne, however, it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne. He had also begun collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled Y.O.L.O., but the duo decided against the project, in favor of increased concern for their respective studio albums.

Take Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. John McDonnell of NME dubbed it ""an affecting masterpiece"" and commended its ""delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive lyrics."" Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal found Drake's ""technical abilities"" to be improved and stated, ""Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up."" Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice called it ""a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West."" Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented the depth of Drake's ""moral psychodramas"" and stated, ""the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying power."" It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial success, eventually being certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the US.

The album's third and fourth singles, ""The Motto"" and Take Care"", were released on November 29, and February 21, 2012 respectively. Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with ""The Motto"" credited for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States. The music video for ""Take Care"" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, ""None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] - make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it."" The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year. The song was also featured on the channel's ""Pop Songs You Must Hear"" list of 2011. ""HYFR"" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified Gold. It would later win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video in 2012, and the channel also ranked him at number two on their ""Hottest MCs in the Game"" list.

In promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip-hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million. He then returned to acting, starring in Ice Age: Continental Drift as Ethan.

2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and commercial mixtapes
During the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer's influence over his next album. Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics prevalent previously.

In January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off of his third album at the conclusion of the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of his third album. The album's second single, ""Hold On, We're Going Home"", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful single off of the album, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song's music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the video. Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing the album's third single, ""Too Much"", alongside featured artist Sampha.

Nothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favorable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in 808s & Heartbreak. The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further promoted by the ""Would You like a Tour?"" throughout late 2013, to early 2014. It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million. Drake then returned to acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night Live, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what ""kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters"". Drake also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city. In late 2014, Drake announced that he had begun recording sessions for his fourth studio album.

In 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the Romeo Santos song Odio. He also appeared on a remix of Tuesday by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard's Rhythmic chart and number twelve on the ""Hot 100"", and released ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"" as a non-album single. The latter went double platinum in the United States.

On February 12, 2015, Drake released If You're Reading This It's Too Late onto iTunes, with no prior announcement. Despite debate on whether it is an album or a mixtape, its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money Records, a scheme that was rumored to allow Drake to leave the label. However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and If You're Reading This It's Too Late sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall. Drake proceeded If You're Reading This It's Too Late with a collaborative mixtape with Future, which was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week.

What a Time to Be Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Drake the first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the same year since 2004. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units. Drake also appeared on the cover of The Fader for their 100th issue.

2016–2017: Views and More Life
Drake announced in January 2016 that his fourth studio album would be launched during the spring, releasing the promotional single ""Summer Sixteen"" later that month. The album was originally titled Views from the six, but would later be shortened to Views. ""Summer Sixteen"" debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip-hop to more tenured artists. This move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as ""goodly brash"" or ""conventionally disrespectful."" It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake popularizing the term ""The Six"" when referencing Toronto. Drake also crashed a Bat Mitzvah in New York City on February 20, performing at the event.

Drake soon released the album's lead singles, ""Pop Style"" and the dancehall-infused ""One Dance"", on April 5. Both debuted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with ""One Dance"" becoming Drake's first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist. The single also became Drake's first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed the album's release date of April 29, and followed it up with various promotional videos. On October 15, ""One Dance"" became Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016.

Views was previewed in London, before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being made available to various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later to release a short film titled Please Forgive Me, starring frequent collaborators, Swedish twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta. As of 2019, Views remains Drake's best-selling album.

Drake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as the show's musical guest. Later, Drake was named as a member of the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury. During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the music video for ""Child's Play"" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics. On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views. At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Drake received the most nominations, with 10, winning the awards for Album of the Year and Best Hip-Hop Video. Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the course of the tour in Europe. Seven additional dates were added a day later due to overwhelming demands.

Soon after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed he would be releasing a project titled More Life in December, however he later pushed the date back to the new year. The project was described as a ""playlist of original music"", rather than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album. He was later revealed to be Spotify's most streamed artist for the second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion streams for all projects on the service, which is more than double the amount of streams he had in 2015. Drake later secured his second and third Grammy Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony. Despite multiple setbacks, Drake announced More Life would be released on March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials released through Instagram. Upon release, More Life received mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200, earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It also set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever streamed album in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music alone. The album also garnered 61.3 million streams on Spotify, dethroning Ed Sheeran's ÷ as the highest opening on the service in a single day. He later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins in a single show. Billboard also reported Drake had been present on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has the most recorded entries by a solo artist.

He then released the single ""Signs"" on June 24, as well as reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset. The singles marked his first releases since More Life, with ""Signs"" was initially released as a collaboration between Drake and French fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the ""Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2018"" fashion show. The event also had a playlist exclusively from OVO Sound, curated by label co-founder Oliver El-Khatib. Drake later hosted the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of Virginia Black. Drake then appeared in The Carter Effect documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince Carter, who was the first superstar player to appear for the Toronto Raptors since the franchise's inception in 1995. The documentary also featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and LeBron James.

2018: Scorpion and return to television
After rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer Pi'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017. Two songs would later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on January 20, 2018, marking Drake's first solo release since More Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring on a remix of the Jay-Z song ""Family Feud"" with Lil Wayne, as the lead single of the latter's Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape. Scary Hours featured the songs ""Diplomatic Immunity"" and ""God's Plan"", which both debuted within the top-ten, with the latter eventually breaking various streaming records as it debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was Drake's second as a solo artist to reach number one.

Drake earned his 70th top 40 hit after featuring on the Migos song ""Walk It Talk It"", which debuted at number eighteen, and peaked at number ten. He later featured on BlocBoy JB's debut single, ""Look Alive"", which was released on February 9, 2018. The song's entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper with the top 10 hits on the Hot 100, with 23. He then featured on a remix to ""Lemon"", a song originally released as collaboration between band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, Drake announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was releasing a single later that night. On April 6, ""Nice for What"" was released, alongside a music video, which featured several female celebrities.

After ""Nice For What"" replaced his own ""God's Plan"" on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace their former number-one debut, Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion, with a planned release date of June 29, 2018. He then released ""I'm Upset"" on May 26, as the album's third single. Scorpion was then released as a double-album, and marked Drake's longest project, with a run-time of just under 90 minutes. The album broke both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it gained 132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming service, respectively. It eventually sold 749,000 album equivalent units in its first week of sales, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.

Shortly thereafter, Drake collaborated with British hip hop promotion Link Up TV on July 7, releasing a freestyle as a part of the promotion's 'Behind Barz' segment, before releasing another freestyle a week later after featuring on Charlie Sloth's long-running Fire in the Booth program on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Drake then earned his sixth number-one hit with ""In My Feelings"" on July 21, which also spawned the viral ""#InMyFeelingsChallenge"" or ""#KiKiChallenge"". The success of ""In My Feelings"" also made Drake the record holder for most number one hits among rappers. Soon after, he released the music video for ""Nonstop"", which was filmed in London during his surprise performance at the Wireless Festival.

He then appeared on the album Astroworld, featuring uncredited vocals for the song ""Sicko Mode"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Drake announced in July 2018 that he planned to ""take 6 months to a year"" to himself in order to produce television and films, including Euphoria. He then began the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour with co-headliners Migos on August 12. This preceded collaboration with Bad Bunny titled ""Mia"", which featured Drake performing in Spanish. He later received the award for Hot Ticket Performer at the 2018 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 16. During a performance in Edmonton on November 7, Drake announced his intention to begin composing his next project in early 2019.

2019–present: Upcoming album
In February 2019, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rap Song, for ""God's Plan"", at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. During his speech, producers abruptly cut to a commercial break, leading viewers to speculate they were censoring his speech during which he criticized The Recording Academy. A legal representative for the Academy then released a statement stating ""a natural pause [led] the producers [to] assume that he was done and cut to commercial,"" and added the organization offered him an opportunity to return to stage, but he declined.

On February 14, Drake re-released his third mixtape, So Far Gone, onto streaming services for the first time to commemorate its 10-year anniversary, and later collaborated with Summer Walker on a remix of Walker's song ""Girls Need Love"", marking his first release of 2019. On April 10, 2019 during a London performance on his Assassination Vacation Tour, the OVO leader told the crowd he was working on his new album before the show. On June 8, Drake appeared on Chris Brown's single ""No Guidance"". On June 15, Drake released two songs, ""Omertà"" and ""Money in the Grave"", on his EP The Best in the World Pack to celebrate the NBA Championship win of the Toronto Raptors. On August 2, he released the compilation album Care Package, consisting of songs released between 2010 and 2016 that were initially unavailable for purchase or commercial streaming; it debuted at number one.

Artistry - influences
Drake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West, Jay Z, and Lil Wayne, while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah, and Usher. Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his ""biggest inspirations"".

Musical style
Drake has credited Kanye West (left) and Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical influences. Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism. His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as ""ting"", ""touching road"", ""talkin' boasy"" and ""gwanin' wassy"". Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip-hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing. He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.

The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional or boastful. However, Drake is often revered for incorporating ""degrading"" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between ""pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata."" Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as ""hyper-reality rap"", which is characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as being distinct from the ""real world.""

Public image
The Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States, with his single, ""The Motto"", which includes, ""You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO."" Drake later popularized the term ""The Six"" in 2015 in relation his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city. Furthermore, the subject matter of his artistry often revolving around relationships, have had widespread impact on social media through photo captions commonly used to reference emotions or personal situations. However, his lyrical contents have had a negative reception from fans and critics deeming him as sensitive; a trait that is understood as being antithetical to hip hop culture. June 10 was declared ""Drake Day"" in Houston, Texas. In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines, in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance. In 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States. He would also donate $200,000 in order to aid relief efforts in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey. In February 2018, following the single ""God's Plan"" debut at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Drake donated $50,000 to a Miami homeless shelter and giving a University of Miami student $50,000 to help with her tuition. Drake then ""kept up the spending spree"" by donating the rest of the song's video budget, $996,631.90, to several charitable causes and regular people across Miami.

The music video for ""Hotline Bling"" went viral, due to Drake's eccentric choices in dancing. The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake's unconventional nature on the song, causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, spawning several parodies. Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exampled by the video for ""Hotline Bling"". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6"" Classic Boots. This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose, in which various items of clothing were produced. Drake had also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the ""Air Jordan OVOs"". Moreover, his style and dress sense have caused GQ magazine to describe him as ""[one of] the most stylish men alive"".

Controversies - legal issues
In 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on ""Marvins Room"". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties. Despite Drake's legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling ""Jimmy Smith Rap"", a 1982 single by jazz musician, Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who stated Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on ""Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2"", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop. Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement. Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics on when collaborating with YG on the song ""Who Do You Love?"". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year. In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.

In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel ""Chubbs"" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also says the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering. The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu, after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference; the judge ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense.

Feuds
Drake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident and released a song criticizing Drake weeks later. Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute.

In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe magazine. Drake would later respond on ""6 God"" and ""6PM in New York"", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment.

Further controversy arose in July 2015, when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during recording sessions for ""RICO"", one of the lead singles off of Mill's second studio album. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller. Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for ""R.I.C.O."". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for ""R.I.C.O."", ""10 Bands"", and ""Know Yourself"". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, titled ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back"", in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with ""Wanna Know"", before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later. Despite subliminal disses from either artist, the feud has not been officially reignited. Drake would further seek to denounce Funkmaster Flex during his Madison Square Garden shows on the Summer Sixteen Tour. Following Meek Mill's sentencing of two to four years for probation violation, Drake stated ""Free Meek Mill"" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on ""Family Feud"". Pusha T would also use the same rationale to criticize Drake on ""Infrared"" in 2018, prompting Drake to respond with the ""Duppy Freestyle"" diss track on May 25. Pusha T would directly respond to the track through ""The Story of Adidon"" on May 29, which presented several claims, including an accusation of Drake fathering a secret child. The pair is considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, with Drake yet to respond to ""The Story of Adidon"".

In 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through ""4PM in Calabasas"", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on ""No Shopping"" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song. However, French Montana claimed that Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake, he has yet to officially respond to Budden. In the same year, Drake mocked Kid Cudi for his mental health, drug use and suicidal urges on ""Two Birds, One Stone"" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter. Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.

In mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator, Kanye West. In an appearance on the talk show The Shop in October, Drake recounted several business meetings with West, who voiced his desire to ""be Quincy Jones"" and work with him, in order to replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson. West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, which was agreed to as Drake ""felt a genuine vibe"" from West, and after West gifted him the beat to ""Lift Yourself"", which inspired Drake to begin writing to the instrumental. West then requested Drake to travel to Wyoming to continue working, and arrived a day after close friend 40. 40 said West was working on an album; contradictory to his previous aim of just wanting to ""give [Drake] beats"". Drake responded by saying West stated he would release in late 2018, and they should continue on. However, upon his arrival in Wyoming, Drake ""[spent] the majority of time working on [West's] music"", only exploring his own after playing the producer the song ""March 14"", which addresses Drake's relationship with his newborn son and co-parent. This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T. West would also release ""Lift Yourself"", and produce ""Infrared""; actions that greatly displeased Drake. This prompted him to denounce West in several songs and live performances. West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018.

Drake has purported to have been in reported feuds with DMX, Kendrick Lamar, Common, The Weeknd, XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez, and Ludacris, although the latter three have been reported to be resolved.

Business ventures - Endorsements
Prior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient. In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger King and Whataburger. Business magazine Forbes commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships ""combined heavily"" for Drake's reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the highest-paid celebrities during that period.

Main article: OVO Sound
During the composition of Nothing Was the Same, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, and business partner, Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the trio to team up to form OVO Sound. The name is an abbreviation derived from the October's Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects. Warner Bros. Records currently distribute the label.

Drake, 40 and PartyNextDoor were the label's inaugural artists. The label houses artists including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, OB O'Brien, Roy Woods, dvsn, Plaza, and Kash Doll, as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Mike Zombie, Nineteen85, and Future the Prince. OVO Sound has released six albums, with two certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Toronto Raptors
On September 30, 2013, at a press conference with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke, Drake was announced as the new ""global ambassador"" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. This would also be the setting where Drake was given The Key to the City. In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities, beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary. He began by hosting an annual ""Drake Night"" segment with the organization, which began in 2013.

Apple Music
Following the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million. This saw all future solo releases by Drake becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers. Drake had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted More Life. Drake's partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform's sharp success, as it attained 10 million subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists, such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services. Through signing with the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before the smartwatch saw public release.

Virginia Black
Two months prior to the release of Views, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based whiskey. This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring's Restaurant in Toronto. The beverage was created and also distributed alongside Proximo Spirits, as well as with Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008. The company described the partnership as ""fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey.""

The product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically. The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music and various tours, such as being part of the ""Virginia Black VIP Lounge"" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016. The company later aired commercials with Dennis Graham, which featured the tagline of ""The Realest Dude Ever"" (in reference toward ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to various European countries in 2017.

Personal life
Drake lives in Hidden Hills, California, since 2012. He also owns a property in Toronto, which was built from the ground-up in 2017, and a Toronto condo adjacent to the CN Tower. He owns a Boeing 767 airplane.

Drake's paternal uncles are bass guitarist Larry Graham and musician Teenie Hodges. Graham achieved both critical and commercial success as a member of the band Sly and the Family Stone, while Hodges featured as the lead guitarist and songwriter for Al Green, and contributed heavily on much of his work in the 1970s, including the hits ""Take Me to the River"", ""Love and Happiness"", and ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"".

Drake is a father to one son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French artist Sophie Brussaux. Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumors after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017; Drake eventually confirmed his fatherhood on the album Scorpion in 2018.

Drake dated singer Rihanna off-and-on from 2009 to 2016. He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums, and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said ""she's a woman I've been in love with since I was 22 years old."" On becoming a single parent, he mused on the talk show The Shop:

As life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don't have the fairy tale, like, 'Oh, Drake started a family with Rihanna and this is like so perfect.' It looks so good on paper. By the way, I wanted that too at one time.

Other artists
There are several other artists that have performed under the name Drake:
1) heavy metal act
2) Jason Drake
3) 60s garage rock
4) Polish sea folk band
5) character from the film “The Pebble and the Penguin” <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Drake"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

12,imagine dragons,3536673,209252811,"Imagine Dragons is a pop rock band which formed in 2008 in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. The band consists of Dan Reynolds (vocals), Wayne Sermon (guitar), Ben McKee (bass) and Daniel Platzman (drums). The band released four EPs - ""Imagine Dragons"" (2009), ""Hell and Silence"" (2010), ""It's Time"" (2011) and ""Continued Silence"" (2012) - before releasing their debut full length album ""Night Visions"" on 4 September 2012.

The band's single ""It's Time"", which previously appeared on the ""It's Time"" and ""Continued Silence"" EPs in addition to appearing on ""Night Visions"", is the group's biggest hit, reaching #33 on the Billboard Hot 100.

In a dark kitchen in the middle of a sweaty night in Las Vegas, all 6’4” of Dan Reynolds is hunched over a laptop, slapping beats on the table and crooning lyrics into a tiny microphone.  Before long, he and the other three members of pop rock band Imagine Dragons would be playing “It’s Time,” that same laptop-demo-turned-supersized-anthem, from the roof of a parking garage to a wave of thousands of screaming fans.  This song title to the single from their 2012 debut KidInaKorner/Interscope release “Continued Silence EP” is an all too apt descriptor of the band’s hard-earned success—but it’s also emblematic of the deep-seated anxiety Reynolds and the rest of the band experienced leaving behind any realistic expectation of a normal job to do the thing they love most. 

A third-generation Las Vegas native, Reynolds is no stranger to the adage “the house always wins,” choosing to pave his musical career with a near obsessive work ethic and hundreds of unused demos rather than roll the dice with the first songs that sprung from his mouth.  It’s no surprise, then, that he was drawn to guitarist Wayne Sermon, another founding member of Imagine Dragons.  Having practically grown up in a recording studio and graduated Berklee College of Music, Wayne had been practicing his guitar through meals and other socially inappropriate situations as long as he could remember; he challenged Dan in a way that was both uncomfortable and exactly what they both needed.  When they began writing songs together and recognized something special was happening, Wayne called up his Berklee friend Ben McKee, who promptly dropped out of school with only a few credits left, moving across the country to play bass for the band.  This sort of reckless/genius behavior is typical for Ben, who has an uncanny penchant for spicy food and a suitcase full of unbelievable road stories.  More recently, the band was joined by drummer Daniel Platzman, another Bostonian schoolmate who seems way too nice to be playing rock and roll until you actually see him in action.

Several tours and three self-released EPs later, Imagine Dragons had made a serious name for itself, particularly in the west coast circuit.  Although their songs vary from nearly whimsical and light to brooding and powerful, listeners are drawn to the inherent honesty in the music.  The only rule of thumb for the band, it seems, is to write from a true place; the result is songs that literally run the spectrum of human emotion.  Attend a concert, and it becomes clear that the live performance of deeply personal songs has a real effect on people.  And the band itself is not immune, as demonstrated when Dan literally passed out into the drum set during a finale song, sending cymbals and drum stands crashing while the rest of the band played on until the close.

Great songwriting is bound to be noticed eventually.  As proof that the harder you work, the luckier you get, one of those people who noticed was Grammy winning producer Alex da Kid (Eminem, Rihanna).  Alex and Dan began collaborating on projects, and soon the band had developed a relationship with Alex and his team.  The alchemy resulting from Alex’s hip hop sensibilities and Imagine Dragons’ anthemic rock is nothing short of explosive.  The byproduct of this creative collision is “Continued Silence,” a six song in-your-face sonic grenade that breaks musical boundaries and yet is strangely relatable by its improbably diverse audience. 

Despite it all, on any given day when they aren’t on the road playing shows, you can still find Imagine Dragons huddled away in a rehearsal room somewhere, banging out song after song in search of the next perfect track.  Like most things in Vegas, the band is angled at going big or going bust.  For the sake of those who love great music, we hope it’s the former. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Imagine+Dragons"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

13,zayn,1868816,95644644,"Zayn Malik is a multi-talented English singer-songwriter best known as one of the founding members of the boy-band-of-a-generation One Direction. Born Zain Javadd Malik on January 12, 1993 in the working-class town of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England, Zayn honed his vocal talents and stage command at a young age. Growing up as a mixed race Pakistani-English Muslim in a postindustrial British town presented some difficulties, which resulted in a number of primary school changes. His talents were eventually fostered at Tong High School, where he delved into performing arts and stage production, even starring as Danny Zuko in the school's production of Grease. In 2010, he auditioned for The X Factor but was eliminated (along with his future One Direction bandmates, who also auditioned solo). The quintet was later brought back as a group and Simon Cowell dubbed them One Direction. Despite finishing in third place, their popularity exploded and would not slow their trajectory until the very end.

After the show, Cowell immediately signed them to his label, Syco Records, kicking off a craze that hadn't been seen since the turn of the millennium with the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC. From 2011 to 2014, One Direction released an album each year, each one more successful than the last. Their fourth album, Four, would turn out to be the last with Zayn. In March 2015, while the band was on the On the Road Again Tour, Malik abruptly parted ways with One Direction a week after his final appearance with the group in Hong Kong. Citing stress and a desire for a simpler life out of the spotlight, Malik later revealed that he simply wanted to make music that he could listen to and enjoy.

Striking out on his own, he signed with RCA Records and moved to Los Angeles, where he began working on his solo effort with Naughty Boy (Beyoncé, Sam Smith). The two soon parted and Malik turned to Frank Ocean collaborator James ""Malay"" Ho for production help. His debut single, ""Pillowtalk,"" was released in late January 2016, debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, and featured a distinctly more adult-themed alt-R&B sound, similar to the Weeknd and Miguel. His full-length debut, Mind of Mine, was released in early 2016 and topped the Billboard 200 chart. Late that year, he returned with the single ""I Don't Wanna Live Forever,"" a collaboration with Taylor Swift and Bleachers' Jack Antonoff that appeared on the soundtrack to Fifty Shades Darker. Second studio album, ""Icarus Falls,"" was released in December 2018. The album contains 27 tracks including six previous singles he has been released. His song with Sia, ""Dusk Till Dawn"" and and his song with PartyNextDoor, ""Still Got Time"" were initially only in Japanese edition of the record. However, in August 2020 these songs were added to the tracklist in streaming services internationally.

In September 2020, Zayn released ""Better"" which is the lead single of his third album ""Nobody Is Listening"" . Later, on January, one week before the album release, Zayn released ""Vibez"" as second single from the album. One week later Zayn released the album. Zayn described this album as ""his most personal project"".

Malik has now been released by RCA Records and is an free agent he remains at his home in Pennsylvania recording music.

14,piso 21,272067,4694532,"Juan David Castaño (el llanero), David Escobar (Dim), Juan David Huertas (El profe) y Pablo Mejía (Pablito), son los integrantes del grupo que ahora suena en las emisoras de la ciudad de medellin, Piso 21.

El mayor tiene solo 26 años y el menor 21. Son jóvenes, sí, pero ya son conscientes de su éxito y más que un grupo, ellos se consideran una familia, pues lo más importante, antes de cantar, es la unión y la lealtad a su amistad.

Todo comenzó en junio del año 2007 cuando se conocieron en un asado que organizó un amigo que tenían en común. Conversando se dieron cuenta de que los cuatro eran músicos y terminaron cantando hasta las 6 de la mañana.

Días después El Profe buscó a Dim y al Llanero y les propuso formar un grupo, pero Dim dijo que sí con la condición de que también incluyeran a Pablito, quien estaba de viaje en ese momento en Contadora, Panamá.

Fue tanta la emoción y la ansiedad por crear el grupo que inmediatamente llamaron a Pablito a Panamá y el aceptó sin dudarlo.

Paso a paso
Su segundo encuentro, o mejor dicho su primer ensayo, fue en el club house de un amigo del edificio San Mitchel, en el piso 21, desde donde se podía ver la ciudad d medellin completa. Este se convirtió durante varios meses en su ensayadero oficial y era allí donde pasaban noches enteras montando las canciones.

""Durante esas noches soñábamos con que algún día escucharían nuestras composiciones en todas esas casa que veíamos desde allá"", cuenta Dim.

""Y creo que lo estamos logrando, pero ahora la idea es que también nos escuchen en aquellas de las que solo veíamos la luz, arriba en las montañas"", continúa El Profe.

Su nombre
A la hora de pensar en cómo se llamarían, dieron muchas vueltas y hasta lo consultaron con sus familias y sus profesores.

Al principio le buscaron por el lado de sus iniciales o pensaron en jugar un poco con los nombres de David y Pablo, pero luego de intentarlo por muchos lados, se les ocurrió Piso 21, pues fue a esta altura donde realmente conformaron el grupo.

Pero a este nombre también le han encontrado una metáfora, pues según ellos, indica que para arriba es adonde quieren llegar, dando pasos lentos, pero seguros y muy largos.

Precisamente antes de empezar cada concierto, el grupo se reúne para gritar su frase favorita ""Piso 21, vamos pa'arriba papá"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Piso+21"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

16,the weeknd,4470383,825716775,"Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, popularly known as The Weeknd (born February 16, 1990 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), is a Canadian R&B/hip-hop musician, singer-songwriter and record producer. He chose his stage name in tribute to when he was 17 years old, when, along with his friend La Mar Taylor, he dropped out of high school, took his mattress, and ""left one weekend and never came home"". However, his estranged former producer Jeremy Rose claims the name was his idea. The letter E was excluded to avoid trademark problems with the Canadian band The Weekend.

The Weeknd gained widespread critical acclaim for his three mixtapes: House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence, which he later compiled to make a remastered, three-disc album titled Trilogy after signing his record deal with Republic. In 2013, he released Kiss Land, which was considered to be his debut studio album.

In 2014, he dropped “Often,” a remix of Beyonce’s “Drunk In Love,” and “King of the Fall.” The Weeknd released two songs in collaboration with the film Fifty Shades of Grey, with Earned It becoming his solo breakout hit.

His second studio album became highly-anticipated, with riveting singles like  The Hills and Can’t Feel My Face leaving fans hungry for more. Beauty Behind the Madness was released on August 28, 2015.

His third studio album, Starboy, was released on November 25, 2016. The Daft Punk-assisted title track led the project as its first official single, released on Wednesday, September 21, 2016, before becoming his third number one track in the United States, as also his home country, Canada. The effort was a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 albums chart with over 348,000 copies sold in its first week, all eighteen tracks debuting on the Billboard Hot 100, receiving a GRAMMY Award for the Best Urban Contemporary Album, category at the 60th annual ceremony, overall for the second time in his music career and being ranked as the third most popular album of 2017 in the U.S.

Next came the My Dear Melancholy EP, released on March 30, 2018 and revolving around his breakups with Bella Hadid during summer of 2016 and Selena Gomez in October 2017. With the lead single, Call Out My Name, the Canadian singer earned the largest first-day Spotify stream count of any song released in 2018 at that time and his eighth Top 10 entry on Hot 100.

Tesfaye’s fourth studio album (and his first in three years), After Hours was officially released on March 20, 2020, and is named after a 1985 movie directed by his idol, Martin Scorsese. It was primarily supported by November 2019-released singles Heartless and Blinding Lights, with the pair becoming his fourth and fifth #1 singles in the US and the latter his first #1 single in the UK. The title track and In Your Eyes were also released as singles.

Although widely expected to receive multiple nominations for After Hours, Tesfaye failed to receive any nominations for the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021). Tesfaye took to his social media to criticize the Recording Academy, claiming corruption. Speculation arose that the announcement of his then-upcoming Super Bowl performance as well as the discrepancy of being nominated as pop music versus R&B contributed to the snubs. On February 5, 2021 The Highlights was released, as his second greatest hits album. Tesfaye performed at the Super Bowl LV halftime show on February 7, 2021 after announcing he would perform in November 2020. He reportedly spent $7 million on his performance at the show. Despite having a mixed response, the show resulted in a surge in streaming and downloads for Tesfaye's After Hours album as well as for the seven other songs he performed.

His fifth album, Dawn FM was released on January 7, 2022, continuing the writing and production work with Swedish pop svengalis Max Martin and Oscar Holter. The album was preceded by the single Take My Breath in August 2021, with Sacrifice announced as the second single. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

19,camila cabello,1962458,102902552,"Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao (born March 3, 1997), known by her stage name Camila Cabello, is a Cuban-Mexican-American singer and songwriter. She is a Latin-influenced pop performer who first came to prominence as a founding member of the girl group Fifth Harmony. Born in Cojimar, Cuba, Cabello moved to Miami, Florida at the age of six. Growing up in a Spanish-speaking environment (born to a Cuban mother and Mexican father), she fostered her love of music by listening to Celia Cruz and Alejandro Fernández. At the age of 15, she auditioned for The X Factor in Greensboro, North Carolina. Even though she was eliminated (along with her four future groupmates), Simon Cowell recognized her talent and combined the girls to form the quintet girl group Fifth Harmony.

Despite finishing in third place, they went on to be the most successful contestants from that season. The group's debut EP, Better Together, was released in October 2013, with acoustic reworkings, Spanish versions (Juntos and Juntos Acoustic), and a remix album following a month later. Their debut single, ""Miss Movin' On,"" was the highest-charting U.S. X Factor single at the time, a feat beaten only by each successive Fifth Harmony single.

The group's debut LP, Reflection, was released in early 2015, featuring the hits ""Sledgehammer"" (written by Meghan Trainor) and ""Worth It,"" featuring rapper Kid Ink. While backstage on Taylor Swift's 1989 world tour, Cabello wrote a duet with Canadian singer/songwriter Shawn Mendes. ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was released in November 2015 and immediately hit the Billboard Top 20. Fifth Harmony's sophomore set, 7/27, was issued in 2016, supported by a world tour and the hit single ""Work from Home.""

Inspired to pursue her own creative endeavors, Cabello paired with rapper Machine Gun Kelly for the October 2016 single ""Bad Things."" Well received, the track made a slow climb toward the top of the Billboard singles chart, and ultimately garnered the singer her first Top Ten song as a solo artist. That December, Cabello announced her departure from Fifth Harmony. Following her exit, Cabello collaborated with Cashmere Cat on ""Love Incredible"" and Pitbull and J Balvin on ""Hey Ma"" from The Fate of the Furious soundtrack.

In May 2017, Cabello released her debut (non-album) solo single, the Sia Furler co-written ""Crying in the Club,"" which peaked in the Top 40 of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The promotional (non-album) single,""I Have Questions,"" was released a few days later. She also joined Bruno Mars as the opening act on his 24K Magic World Tour. New writing and recording sessions for her album were influenced by the success of her single ""Havana"" featuring Young Thug, which postponed its original release date and influenced the change of the record name from “The Hurting, The Healing, The Loving.” to “Camila.”

In early 2018, she returned with her debut full-length solo album, Camila, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. It featured production by Frank Dukes, Jarami, and others. Buoyed by the number one single ""Havana,"" featuring Young Thug, and ""Never Be the Same,"" the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.

In April 2018, Cabello embarked on the Never Be the Same Tour, her first as a solo artist. She was featured in ""Sangria Wine"", a song she recorded with Pharrell Williams. Cabello released the song live during her headlining tour. In May 2018, Cabello made a cameo appearance in Maroon 5's music video for ""Girls Like You"" featuring Cardi B. In the same month, she began performing as the opening act for American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift in her Reputation Stadium Tour in between the European leg of the Never Be the Same Tour. Cabello was featured in the remix version of ""Beautiful"", a song from American singer Bazzi. The song was released on August 2. On October 9, 2018, Cabello released the video single, ""Consequences"", having first surprised 12 of her biggest fans in advance, with a ""Most Amazing Mystery Gift & Personal Letter"".

On June 21, 2019, Cabello released ""Señorita"" with Canadian singer Shawn Mendes, along with the music video. The song debuted at number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and marks Mendes' and Cabello's second collaboration, following ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" released in 2015. In August, ""Señorita"" climbed to the number one position, making it Cabello's second single to top the Hot 100 chart as lead artist. According to the IFPI, ""Señorita"" was the third best-selling song of 2019 globally. She was featured on Ed Sheeran's ""South of the Border"" along with American rapper Cardi B, released in July 2019.

In October 2018, Cabello announced she would start working on new music in the new year after the holidays. In December 2018 she was nominated for two Grammys: Best Pop Solo Performance for a live version of ""Havana"" and Best Pop Vocal Album for Camila. Her performance at the ceremony made her the first female Latin artist to open the show. Cabello announced her sophomore album, Romance, which released December 6th, 2019. It debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 Chart and features two collaborations with Canadian singer-songwriter, Shawn Mendes and American Rapper, DaBaby. The fourth single, My Oh My, which featured DaBaby, has reached the top 20 in many countries and peaked at 12 on the Billboard hot 100. 

In July 2021, Cabello began teasing new music to her Instagram, captioning one of her many stories with ""ready?"" Shortly after, Cabello released 'Don't Go Yet' on the 23rd of the same month, the first single of the album. On the same day, Cabello confirned that the album featuring the single would be titled ""Familia"" (directly translating to family) and was set to be released that year.

On September 3rd 2021, a musical adaptation of Cinderella, directed by Kay Cannon for Sony Pictures starring Cabello was released internationally. This was little than a month after the premiere at Greek Theatre on August 30th 2021. The film had mixed reviews from the general public, and was given a 41% on Rotten Tomatoes. The soundtrack, however, was positively received by approx. 60% of the same audience. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Camila+Cabello"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

23,the neighbourhood,3222407,282724050,"The Neighbourhood is an American alternative rock/dark pop band that formed in Newbury Park, California, USA in August 2011. The band consists of Jesse Rutherford, Jeremy Freedman, Zach Abels, and Mikey Margott. Brandon Fried (drums) was kicked out of the band on November 15 2022 after groping allegations. Bryan Sammis (drums) left the group in January 2014.

The band released their first EP, I'm Sorry... in January 2013, where their single Sweater Weather reached #1 in the U.S. Alternative Tracks and #8 on the U.S. Rock Tracks and #33 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also charted at #68 in Canada. Their first album, I Love You. was released on April 23, 2013. 

In early 2012 a mysterious band appeared online. The group, The Neighbourhood, revealed no biographical information, no photos and no backstory, offering only a moody track titled ""Female Robbery."" Fans and the press were confounded, scouring the Internet for any information that might lead them to the identity of these musicians. Pieces of the puzzle, some reflecting reality and some not so much, began to emerge. The Neighbourhood were a quintet. They were from California despite the British spelling of their name. They had a second track, ""Sweater Weather,"" which had an accompanying -- and equally dark -- video.

Although The Neighbourhood's identity remained hazy, it became clear that the music they were making felt transformative to critics and fans alike. The evocative combination of rock instruments with R&B and hip-hop aesthetics seemed, in many ways, revelatory, a reimagining of sounds that seemed to make people clamour for more information with even greater fervour. In April, BBC Radio One DJ Zane Lowe, an early champion of the group, let it slip that The Neighbourhood was the handiwork of musician Jesse Rutherford, a resident of Newbury Park, CA. By early May, as the band unveiled a free, self-released EP titled ""I'm Sorry,"" it became understood that the identity of this young band was, ultimately, secondary to the music itself.

So who is The Neighbourhood? In essence, the group, which was formed in August 2011, is a collection of five friends who make music together. They're headed by Rutherford, a 21-year-old singer who has dabbled in various genres, including hip-hop, before crafting the merge of sounds that categorizes The Neighbourhood's style. Their debut EP was produced by Justyn Pilbrow, who brought Emile Haynie on board to collaborate on ""Female Robbery."" The EP, recorded at the end of last year, is composed of shadowy, emotional music with visuals to match. And it's all part of the band's master plan.

""I always have a strong vision before I go into anything,"" Rutherford says. ""I don't know how to make music any other way. It was all in my head, and that vision for the music was to make hip-hop beats with guitars and I was going to sing and rap over them. We wanted to do that hip-hop aesthetic on an indie platform.""

""I'm Sorry,"" a five-song disc, is a precursor to the band's debut album, which is also being produced by Pilbrow and Haynie. The album, expected out in March 2013, will expand the group's moody sensibility, which pairs brooding layers of instrumentals with Rutherford's hip-hop-inspired croon. The style, which the band has dubbed ""black and white"" due to its confident inspirations, is based largely on rhythm, as evidenced by the EP. ""When I started in music I started doing drums and then I started doing vocals,"" Rutherford explains. ""And then I combined the two together because to me rapping is just rhythmic vocals. I think the rhythm of hip-hop is really what got me into it. It's not just words being said; it's about how the words are said.""

In the end, all you need to know about The Neighbourhood is in that music and in those words. There are more facts, more pieces of the puzzle, more information to unveil. But what's the fun in being given the full picture when you can slowly discover it for yourself? It's better to leave some mystery lingering. Because, after all, it's that unknowing that brought The Neighbourhood to people's attention to begin with. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Neighbourhood"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

26,natti natasha,306648,4361358,"Natalia Alexandra Gutiérrez, known by her stage name Natti Natasha, is a Dominican reggaeton singer, songwriter, and actress. Hailing from Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Natasha grew up surrounded by endless musical influences and enrolled in Santiago’s School of Fine Arts at the age of seven where she developed her singing abilities, describing her time at the school as “one of the best of her life.” Her studio experience would begin as a teenager when she would record songs as a hobby and later alongside friends.

This all led up to her decision to make the biggest and riskiest move of her life, and that was to move to the United States. She settled in the Bronx, New York, or “the City of the Dreams and Dreamers” for young, aspiring musicians like her at the time. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Natti called the move “one of the craziest moves anyone ever did in her family,” and that she often looks back at the decision and wonders what she was doing. Natti would hop from studio to studio, working without pay, but to her, this was a way to get her name out there. A producer friend from Santiago would soon step in and lend her his New York studio.

Natti’s first-ever break came when icon Don Omar signed her to his record label, the Orfanato Music Group, and the pair would go on to make history for years to come. Their collaborations “Dutty Love,” “Tus Movimientos,” “Perdido en tus Ojos,” and a “Hold Ya” remix with Gyptian made waves across Latin America and introduced the world to future reggaeton royalty. Her debut project, an EP titled “All About Me” was released on March 28, 2012.

Natti would continue to make big career moves throughout the years including her departure from Don Omar’s record label and signing onto Pina Records in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2017 when her big breakout would come once and for all. Not only did she record and release a collaboration titled “Otra Cosa” alongside the legendary Daddy Yankee, but she also released what was arguably the biggest song of 2017. “Criminal” featuring Ozuna became an instant hit upon its release, the music video amassing over 1 billion views in just five months and becoming the most watched music video by a female singer released that year.

2019 saw the release of her much-anticipated debut album, “ilumiNATTI,” on February 15. 15 tracks made up the project with two collaborations in total, “Te Lo Dije'' with Anitta and “Soy Mía” with Kany García. Standout track “La Mejor Version de Mi” would transform into a bachata hit with its remix featuring bachata king Romeo Santos.

Natti’s sophomore album titled “NATTIVIDAD” would be released two years later on September 24, 2021 with 17 tracks featuring several chart-topping collaborators such as Becky G, Maluma, and Prince Royce. The release was followed up by the six-episode docuseries titled “Everybody Loves Natti” which documented her pregnancy and relationship with fiancé Raphy Pina. The series premiered on November 19, 2021 on Amazon Prime Video and was generally well received. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Natti+Natasha"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

34,dani martín,61449,966478,"Best known as the frontman of Spain's biggest power pop group, El Canto del Loco, singer/actor Dani Martín proved he could go it alone after juggling a music career with several critically acclaimed acting roles. Born Daniel Martín Garcia in Madrid in 1977, he regularly entertained his family with impersonations of his favorite singers as a child and received his first taste of exposure as a 14-year-old on the TVE show Rock Out. 

After attending the Cristina Rota and William Layton drama schools, he teamed up with guitarist Iván Ganchegui in 1994 to form El Canto del Loco, who went through various lineup changes before releasing their 2000 self-titled debut album. The band went on to become one of Spain's biggest pop/rock acts, scoring four chart-topping albums, A Contracorriente (2002), Estados de Ánimo (2003), Zapatillas (2005), and Personas (2008), in a hugely successful six-year period.

However, Martín simultaneously continued to showcase his acting talents, appearing on both the big screen in gay-themed comedy I Love You Baby, Bigas Luna's comedy Yo Soy la Juani, and Pedro Almodóvar's Broken Embraces, plus the small screen in medical drama Hospital Central, cop show Four Countdown, and sitcom Los Hombres de Paco. After El Canto del Loco decided to take a hiatus in 2009, Martín began work on his debut solo record with producer Bori Alarcón, the result of which was 2010's Pequeño, a highly autobiographical and deeply personal record written in the wake of his sister's death. It was a formidable success, hitting number one in Spain and spending more than 18 months on the charts. Three years went into the making of his second solo album, Dani Martín, which spent four weeks at number one in Spain and also charted in Mexico and Italy. Tour dates consumed most of 2014, culminating in the release of his live album Mi Teatro in October 2014.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Dani+Mart%C3%ADn"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

35,ellie goulding,3346543,125561969,"Ellie Goulding (born Elena Jane Goulding, 30 December 1986 in Hereford, England) is an English singer-songwriter. Having caught the public's attention in 2010 with her singles ""Starry Eyed"" and ""Guns and Horses,"" British vocalist Ellie Goulding quickly rose to the top of the charts with her infectious electronic pop sound. Although she started out writing songs in a folk-inflected style, she eventually grew into a more electronic-influenced artist, touching upon dance music and ambient synth pop. With her unique soprano warble and knack for writing catchy yet emotionally earnest songs, Goulding, much like her predecessors Kate Bush and Imogen Heap, stands at the forefront of contemporary mainstream music and arty, independent-minded pop.

Born in Hereford, England, she later moved to the country's east coast to study drama at the University of Kent. Goulding had developed a love for folk music as a teenager, and her time at university also exposed her to electronica. After two years, she took a break from her studies and moved to West London, where she pursued a career as an alternative singer/songwriter and befriended producers like Starsmith and Frankmusik, who gave her songs an electro-pop twist. In 2009, Goulding began building an audience via the Internet, where early tracks like ""Starry Eyed"" and a cover of Sam Sparro's ""Black & Gold"" were posted on tastemaking MP3 blogs such as Discodust. Goulding soon graduated from the blogosphere to print media, gaining praise from mainstream publications like The Guardian and fielding offers from record labels. She ultimately signed a major-label deal with Polydor Records and began making preparations to release her debut album. In the meantime, she penned songs for Diana Vickers, Gabriella Climi, and others.

During the final weeks of 2009, Goulding topped the BBC's Sound of 2010, a poll conducted by British music critics and industry insiders to identify new talent. Building on that momentum, she released Lights -- a sparkling debut album that splashed Goulding's vocal flutter across a landscape of acoustic and synthesized instruments -- in March 2010. Lights topped the U.K. charts during its first week and spun off ""Starry Eyed"" as a Top Five single (it also charted well in Ireland and New Zealand). Later that year, the album was re-released as Bright Lights, featuring seven new recordings (including a cover of Elton John's ""Your Song,"" which peaked at number two).

In 2012, Goulding returned with her sophomore album, Halcyon, which showcased an even more sonically adventurous, electro-pop-infused sound. In 2013, a deluxe reissue featuring ten extra songs was released; entitled Halcyon Days, it acted as a supplement to the original release. Two of its new songs, ""Burn"" and ""How Long Will I Love You,"" were among her biggest hits. The following year, she was featured on Calvin Harris' Top Ten U.K. hit ""Outside,"" participated in Band Aid 30's update of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?,"" and entered the U.K. Top Ten once more with ""Beating Heart,"" a song released on the soundtrack for Divergent. Another soundtrack single, ""Love Me Like You Do,"" added to the success of Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015.

That same year, Goulding released her third studio album, Delirium, which featured collaborations with Max Martin, Greg Kurstin, and others. The pop-leaning Delirium included the single ""On My Mind"" and peaked at number three on the U.S. and U.K. charts. Goulding returned in 2017 on ""First Time,"" a collaboration with electronic producer Kygo.

In 2018, Goulding joined Tap Management after almost a decade with First Access Management.[107] She appeared on a collaboration with Sean Paul on his Mad Love the Prequel EP titled ""Bad Love"", released on 29 June 2018.[108]

On 12 April 2019, Goulding released the single ""Sixteen"".[113] Goulding said of the single, ""...That age was such a pivotal year for me in many ways and this song is so close to my heart. It takes me back to the reckless days of being a teenager and I hope it reminds us all about the innocence of youth.""[114]

Goulding released ""Hate Me"" with American rapper Juice Wrld on 26 June 2019.[115][116] It was premiered by Zane Lowe as his 'World Record' on Beats 1.[117] In July, Goulding stated that her next material to be released would be the songs ""Woman I Am"" and ""Start"".[118] In November, she released her rendition of Joni Mitchell's Christmas song ""River"", which topped the UK Singles Chart, becoming her third UK number one single and the last UK number one song of the 2010s.[119]

On 13 March 2020, Goulding released the new single ""Worry About Me"" which was created in-collaboration with Blackbear.[120] In a radio interview with Heart the same month, she revealed that the album ""kind of comes in two parts"", adding that ""the first side is something written entirely by me which was fun and I wrote most of it in New York when I was living there a few years back. I play the guitar and I play the bass and piano and then I'm singing a lot of vocals. It's very classically influenced because I love classical music. There's a lot going on, it's a big soundscape and one big film. The second half is my kind of alter ego songs.""[121] On 21 May she released single ""Power"" and on 30 June single ""Slow Grenade"" with Lauv.

Goulding released her fourth studio album, Brightest Blue, on 17 July 2020. Originally scheduled for 5 June 2020, the album's release was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album debuted at the top of the UK Album Chart, becoming Goulding's third album to do so,[122] as well as at No. 2 in Scotland.[123] It reached the top 10 in Ireland[124] as well as the top 40 in over ten countries including Australia, Germany and the United States.

Goulding announced on an Instagram Q&A that she would be releasing new music which was not part of the Brightest Blue era at the end of January 2021.[125] On 21 January, she released a collaboration with electronic duo Silk City, titled ""New Love"".[126] On 30 September, Goulding performed ""Anything Could Happen"" as part of the opening ceremony for Expo 2020, held in Dubai.[127]

On 19 June 2022, Goulding performed at Rock in Rio in Lisbon, Portugal. After the concert, she announced that she would be releasing new music in July. The following day, she blacked out all her social media profiles.[128] Back in July 2021, during an interview with Joe Wicks, she described the forthcoming album as ""a dance record. It's electronic pop, a dance thing from outer space"".[129] On 4 July 2022, she announced the release of ""Easy Lover"" featuring Big Sean, which was released on 15 July.[130] The single did not enter the UK Singles Top 100, but peaked at number 31 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart Top 100.[131] It was followed by ""All by Myself"", a collaboration between Goulding and producers Alok and Sigala, on 7 October.[132] Goulding released the single ""Let It Die"" along with its video on 19 October and announced the same day that her fifth studio album Higher Than Heaven would be released on 3 February 2023.[133][134]

39,panic! at the disco,3919744,241072164,"Panic! at the Disco was an American pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 by childhood friends Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, Brent Wilson, and Brendon Urie. Following several lineup changes, Panic! began operating as the solo project of frontman Urie from 2015 until the project's discontinuation in 2023.

Panic! at the Disco recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Popularized by the second single, ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, Pretty. Odd. (2008), was preceded by the single ""Nine in the Afternoon"". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. In 2009, Ross and Walker formed a new band, the Young Veins, leaving Urie and Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco.

Continuing as a duo, Urie and Smith released a new single, ""New Perspective"", for the movie Jennifer's Body, and recruited bassist Dallon Weekes and guitarist Ian Crawford as touring musicians for live performances. Weekes was later inducted into the band's lineup as a full-time member in 2010. The band's third studio album, Vices & Virtues (2011), was recorded solely by Urie and Smith in 2010, produced by John Feldmann and Butch Walker. Crawford departed once the tour cycle for Vices & Virtues ended in 2012.

As a three-piece, Urie, Smith, and Weekes recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, in 2013. Prior to the release of the album, Smith unofficially left the band due to health and drug-related issues, leaving Urie and Weekes as the remaining members. The duo recruited guitarist Kenneth Harris and drummer Dan Pawlovich as touring musicians for live performances.

In 2015, Smith officially left the band after not performing live with them since his departure in 2013. Shortly thereafter, Weekes reverted to being a touring member once again, resulting in Panic! becoming Urie's solo project. In April 2015, ""Hallelujah"" was released as the first single from Panic! at the Disco's fifth studio album, Death of a Bachelor (2016). In December 2017, Weekes officially announced his departure from the band.

Austin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York. He was raised by his father, Richard Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip-hop, country, and rock. When Malone was nine years old, he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys. Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game Guitar Hero.

Malone has always had a love for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event. According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band. He says soon afterward he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip-hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.

According to Malone, he chose ""Post Malone"" as his stage name when he was 14 or 15. The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone, but Malone later explained that ""Post"" is his last name, and he used a ""rap name generator"" to get ""Malone"".

In August 2016, Malone issued an apology for his album, Stoney, being late. It was available for pre-order on November 4 and was finally released on December 9.

In 2001, the band regrouped, with guitarist James Valentine added to the line-up, and pursued a new direction under the name: Maroon 5. At this point, Jesse Carmichael switched to playing the keyboards and this has become his main instrument in the band (although he also plays rhythm guitar to this day).

The stylistic range of left-field pop artist Kali Uchis is reflected in the variety of her collaborators – an extensive genre-crossing list that includes Tyler, the Creator, Gorillaz, Daniel Caesar, Juanes, and BadBadNotGood. A singer, songwriter, and producer, as well as a video director, Uchis truly arrived on her own with the self-released Por Vida (2015), an EP that led to a deal with Virgin EMI. By the time Uchis released her lively debut full-length, the Top Five Billboard R&B/hip-hop hit Isolation (2018), she had already been nominated for Grammy awards through her featured appearances on Daniel Caesar's ""Get You"" and Juanes' ""El Ratico.""

Kali Uchis experienced the majority of her upbringing in Virginia and also spent time in her parents' native Colombia. As a teenager growing up in Alexandria, just south of Washington, D.C., she learned to play piano and saxophone and also developed a deep interest in visual arts. Her recorded debut was made in 2012 with the self-released mixtape Drunken Babble. Within three years, she had several singles to her credit, including ""Know What I Want"" and ""Lottery,"" typically promoted with videos she directed, as well as collaborations with Snoop Dogg, GoldLink, Tyler, the Creator, and Major Lazer. Following the 2015 independent release of Por Vida, a free digital-download EP with tracks produced by Diplo, Kaytranada, and Tyler, Uchis started releasing her material through major-label Virgin EMI. A DJ Dahi-tweaked version of Por Vida's ""Ridin Round,"" issued that November after a move to Los Angeles, was the artist's first single for the major label. ""Only Girl,"" a relaxed Kaytranada production featuring Vince Staples and the Internet's Steve Lacy, followed in April 2016. She was also featured that year on Daniel Caesar's ""Get You.""

Throughout 2017, Uchis added to her discography of featured appearances via tracks by Juanes, Gorillaz, Tyler, Bootsy Collins, and Miguel, and she previewed her debut album with the singles ""Tyrant"" (featuring Jorja Smith) and ""Nuestro Planeta"" (featuring Reykon). By the end of the year, ""Get You"" had been nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best R&B Performance, and Juanes' ""El Ratico"" made Uchis a Latin Grammy nominee when it was up for Record of the Year. January 2018 saw the release of the BadBadNotGood-produced single ""After the Storm"" (featuring Tyler and Bootsy). Uchis released her debut album, Isolation, three months later. It debuted at number 32 on the Billboard 200 and entered the R&B/hip-hop chart at number four.

62,doja cat,2914613,344947758,"Doja Cat rose from viral novelty track buzz to mainstream superstar with her smooth, hypnotic, R&B-flecked pop songs of sexuality, friendship, and personal power. She gained some significant attention with her early releases, but it was her 2019 sophomore effort, Hot Pink, that took her to the top of the Hot 100. Subsequent charting singles and collaborations with SZA and Saweetie further solidified her star power, and made the arrival of her 2021 album Planet Her all the more hotly anticipated. A number two Billboard 200 hit, Planet Her also earned several Grammy nominations. Singles followed, including her savvy 2022 cover of Hole's ""Celebrity Skin"" 2022's ""Vegas"" off the Elvis soundtrack, and 2023's trip-hop-inflected ""Attention"" all of which spotlighted Doja's adventurous, genre-crossing sensibilities. The latter track and ""Paint the Town Red"" appeared on her fourth album, 2023's Scarlet, which found her digging deep into her rap and hip-hop roots and became her third consecutive album to hit the Top Ten of the Billboard 200. Doja Cat was born Amala Zandile Dlamini in 1995 in Tarzana, California, the daughter of South African actor Dumisani Dlamini and painter Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer. After moving to New York for a few years, she returned to California with her mother. As a child, she studied piano and took tap, ballet, and jazz dance lessons. She also discovered surfing and breakdancing. By her teens, she was teaching herself to sing and listening to an eclectic mix of hip-hop, indie rock, R&B, and electronic music. Doja also began recording songs on her computer and in 2014 released her debut EP, Purrr! She quickly found herself with a viral hit with the track ""So High"" More singles followed, including the languid ""Nunchucks"" and ""No Police"" each one grabbing attention online. Another single, ""Mooo!"" arrived in 2018 and quickly went viral. On the heels of that success, Doja Cat issued her full-length debut album, Amala, which found her expanding upon her dreamy, meme-friendly sound with more hip-hop-, pop-, and R&B-infused tracks, including ""Candy"" and ""Roll with Us"" In 2019, she issued an expanded version of Amala that added the singles ""Juicy"" and ""Tia Tamera"" featuring Rico Nasty. Her sophomore album, Hot Pink, was quick to follow; with features from Smino, Gucci Mane, and Tyga, the 2019 LP leaned more into the sexually wry aspects of her ever-shifting persona. A Top Ten hit on the Billboard 200, the album's fifth single, ""Say So"" pushed her even further up the charts. After making a steady rise in the Hot 100 at the start of 2020, the multi-platinum track finally hit number one in May, boosted by a Nicki Minaj remix. After picking up a couple of American Music Awards, Doja carried the momentum from her breakout year into 2021. She began appearing alongside established celebrities more frequently, adding a guest feature to Saweetie's single ""Best Friend"" contributing to an Ariana Grande remix with Megan Thee Stallion, and releasing the SZA-assisted single ""Kiss Me More"" All of this led up to the June 2021 release of her third full-length studio album, Planet Her. It featured guest spots from Young Thug, The Weeknd, JID, and others, and its cover art was shot by photographer David LaChapelle. The album, which reached number two on the Billboard 200 and topped the R&B albums chart, also garnered Grammy nominations for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album.

65,anne-marie,1015962,17736050,"Essex, England-born Anne-Marie Nicholson was no stranger to performing by the time her debut EP dropped in 2015, having shared the stage as a 12-year-old with none other than Jessie J in a West End production of Whistle Down the Wind. She also auditioned for Les Misérables without telling her parents, and was offered a part. It was a risk that paid off, as it served to open her parents' eyes to her singing ability. Aside from West End commitments, the intervening years between her days as a child star and the advent of her career as a pop singer were spent becoming a world karate champion no fewer than three times, an art form she credited with teaching her discipline and focus, two essential traits of becoming a successful musician.

After a chance meeting with an aspiring singer/songwriter, she managed to secure some studio time in Elton John's Rocket Studios, and, after hearing what she could do, she was subsequently picked up by Elton's management company Rocket Music. Anne-Marie released a demo in 2013 entitled Summer Girl, which drew some attention to the singer, most notably garnering a fan in Ed Sheeran. Despite the encouraging start to her solo career, things were put on hold to give her more time to develop as an artist.

Having guested on tracks by dubstep supergroup Magnetic Man, London-based garage duo Gorgon City, and progressive house trio Raized by Wolves, Anne-Marie caught the attention of Brit and MOBO award winners Rudimental. She was featured alongside Dizzee Rascal and Will Heard on two tracks from their second album, 2015's We the Generation, and spent two years touring with the band, playing some of the world's biggest stages and best-known festivals.

The summer of that year also saw the release of Anne-Marie's debut EP on Rudimental's then-new record label, Major Tom's. The aptly titled Karate EP featured three tracks and a Chloe Martini remix, and producers Josh Record and Two Inch Punch worked with her on the record. Both the lead single ""Karate,"" a slick fusion of electro-grime and R&B, and the follow-up ""Gemini,"" garnered some very positive reviews and led Anne-Marie to gigging as a solo artist. In early 2016, the single ""Do It Right"" reached the U.K. charts, and several months later ""Alarm"" hit the Top 40 in several charts around the world.

In 2017, Anne-Marie scored a hit single when she featured on Clean Bandit's multi-platinum ""Rockabye"" with Sean Paul. The song topped the charts across Europe and in Australia, breaking into the Top Ten in Canada and the U.S. She followed with the solo singles ""Ciao Adios"" and ""Heavy,"" which both charted in the U.K. and Ireland. Both tracks appeared on her debut full-length, Speak Your Mind, which saw release in April 2018. The record also featured the track ""Friends,"" written and recorded with American dance producer Marshmello. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Anne-Marie"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

68,mark ronson,2650797,42247633,"Mark Ronson  (born 4 September 1975) is a sought-after producer, who's worked with such diverse artists as Miley Cyrus, Jay-Z, Lily Allen, Robbie Williams, Bruno Mars, Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Duran Duran and comedian Jimmy Fallon. 

Born in London, he is the son of writer Ann Dexter-Jones and real estate tycoon Laurence Ronson. His mother later married Mick Jones, lead guitarist of multiplatinum selling rock band Foreigner. He has two sisters: fashion designer Charlotte Ronson and DJ Samantha Ronson. He spent his childhood in a wealthy suburb of London where he lived on the same street as Paul McCartney‘s family. When his parents divorced at age 8, he moved to New York, where he made friends with John Lennon's son, Sean Lennon.

Ronson played guitar and drums from an early age, but it wasn't until moving to New York City with his mother that Ronson discovered DJ culture. At age 16, already a fan of such popular hip-hop artists as Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys, Ronson began listening to the various hip-hop mixtapes released every few months by DJs. Inspired, Ronson confiscated his father's record collection and began trying his hand at mixing. 

The young DJ with the diverse taste soon caught the ears and eyes of various socialites and New York celebrities, including fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger, who featured Ronson along with other sons and daughters of celebrities in a 1997 fashion campaign. A year later, hip-hop mogul Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs hired Ronson to DJ his fabled 29th birthday bash. These and other high-profile gigs boosted Ronson's ""hip quotient"" and helped promote his more serious-minded music career. Fusing his eclectic turntable skills with his knowledge of musical instruments and songwriting, Ronson eventually embarked on his first solo project. Featuring such diverse guest artists as dancehall rapper Sean Paul, hip-hop artist Mos Def, Jack White of the White Stripes, and Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, Ronson's debut album, Here Comes the Fuzz, bowed for Elektra in 2003.

Ronson's second album, Version, adds to his eclectic style. In this sophomore album, Ronson fuses a range of musical genres from Daniel Merriweather to Ol' Dirty Bastard to Phantom Planet with an up tempo contemporary funk sound. All the songs on this album are covers of previous Billboard top-10 pop songs, with a jazzy twist.

Career

Attending Vassar College and then New York University (NYU), Ronson became a regular at downtown hip-hop spots and made his name as a DJ on the New York club scene in 1993. He was soon one of the most respected DJs and was being called on for celebrities' private parties. Ronson is known for his diverse, genre-spanning selection, influenced by both the hip-hop scene of New York and the more rock influence of the UK, amongst others.

He moved on, however, to producing music. After producing Nikka Costa's song ""Everybody Got Their Something,"" Ronson signed a record contract with Elektra Records. His first album Here Comes the Fuzz was released in 2003 and was a critically acclaimed success that featured artists of all genres, despite initially poor sales. The most well known song from the album, "" Ooh Wee"" samples "" Sunny"" by Boney M and features Nate Dogg, Ghostface Killah, and Trife Da God. He has since produced multiple songs on the albums of singers Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse, Lily Allen, and Robbie Williams.

In 2004, he formed his own record label, Allido Records, a subsidiary of Sony BMG's J Records, along with his longtime manager Rich Kleiman. The first artist he signed to Allido was rapper Rhymefest, most well-known for winning the Grammy for co-writing Kanye West's ""Jesus Walks"".

In March 2006, Ronson released a cover of Radiohead's "" Just"" as a single. In certain areas, such as the UK, it gained major radio play. It also saw release as part of Exit Music: Songs with Radio Heads, a full Radiohead covers CD, in April, later appearing on Ronson's second album, Version, which was released in the UK on 16 April 2007. It includes other covers of a diverse selection of rock & pop songs including: Kaiser Chiefs' "" Oh My God"" (featuring guest vocals from Lily Allen), an instrumental version of Coldplay's "" God Put A Smile Upon Your Face"", Britney Spears' ""Toxic"", Ryan Adams' ""Amy"", Maxïmo Park's "" Apply Some Pressure"", The Zutons' ""Valerie"" and Kasabian's ""L.S.F."".

70,men i trust,1717203,86402801,"Men I Trust is Dragos, Emma, Jessy, Mathieu and Alexis. Founded in 2014, the indie dance band from Montreal, Canada loves smooth sounds, calm melodies and simple rhythms that relax, but make your right foot tap and your chin bounce on the beats. They record, mix, master and shoot their music videos. 

Jessy and Dragos knew each other since their fourth year of high school. Back then (mid-2000’s), Dragos had somewhat of a background in classical piano and Jessy mastered the dark and esoteric art of the metal guitar solist.

In 2012, while finishing his master’s degree in audio postproduction at Laval University, Dragos spent most of his days and sleeping hours at the “LARC” studio working on his solo projects. He randomly met Jessy again, who was finishing his bachelor degree in Jazz guitar, in one of the faculty’s hallways and talked about doing a French-Touch / Italo-Disco track together. Some weeks later, they did just that. And it worked out so well that they decided to extend their collaboration to a whole project where many singers such as Odile Marmet-Rochefort, Gabrielle Shonk, Helena Deland and Geoffroy Sauvé, would be involved.

Between 2012 and 2016, all of Jessy’s and Dragos’ releases were made as part of Dragos’ masters and (dropped) PhD studies in order to gain access to the LARC’s infrastructure and to develop a unique sound.


Emma was a fortuitous encounter. In 2015 a mutual friend presented her to Dragos through a video posted over the Internet. She was casually singing and playing the guitar around a campfire with some of her friends. Emma’s voice was different, being less clear, more grainy and fragile with a mysterious twist that caught their attention. They reached her and tried recording one song called “Out in myself”, which turned to be one of the band’s easiest to record.

Jessy and Dragos then invited her to join them on live shows with Odile at the beginning of 2015. The womans' voices blended wonderfully together and the band got lots of positive feedback from the experience. Emma has been part of Men I Trust since then.

With their second album “Headroom"", Men I Trust truly became a trio. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Men+I+Trust"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
71,dua lipa,2746572,261617306,"Dua Lipa (born August 22, 1995) is an English-Albanian singer-songwriter. She was born in London of refugee parents from the Republic of Kosovo, growing up between both countries until fully moving back to London at age 15.

Dua Lipa began to write her name in the music industry. Lipa gained attention from the specialized media as an artist after the release of her debut album in 2017,  ""Dua Lipa"" (self-titled). It won the third position on the UK Albums Chart and featured eight singles. ""New Rules""  and ""IDGAF"" have become global hits, reaching the number 1 position in countries such as Australia, Belgium, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, as well as reaching the top ten positions in more than 30 countries, including the USA for ""New Rules"" . The album featured the hits ""One Kiss"" with Calvin Harris, ""Be The One"", ""Scared To Be Lonely"" with Martin Garrix, ""No Lie"" with Sean Paul and many others.  It later received 5 nominations at the BRITs Awards, the most important British awards ceremony in music. She also won with her debut album two Grammys, ""Best Dance Recording"" for her song ""Electricity"" with Silk City, and moreover the ""Best New Artist"" award. ""Dua Lipa"" (self-titled) is the most streamed female album of all-time on Spotify.

But Lipa's great success would even come in her second album ""Future Nostalgia"", which made the promising young woman a true pillar of world pop music. Having hits such as ""Don't Start Now"", ""Break My Heart"" and ""Levitating"" , the album is currently the most played female album of the 2020's decade on Spotify and secured a Grammy at the 2021 ceremony for ""Best Pop Vocal Album"" and was present among the nominations for ""Album of the Year"". It also won the Brit Award for ""Album of the Year"". ""Future Nostalgia"" is the 2nd most streamed female album of all-time on Spotify. ""Don't Start Now"" became her most streamed hit on Spotify, nominated for ""Record of the Year"" at the Grammys. It was the biggest female song of the year 2020.

The British phenomenon has captured an all-time record on the Billboard Hot 100, all thanks to the success of ""Levitating"". The track became the longest-charting female song on the chart, with 77 weeks, being the 4th song overall to reach this astonishing feat. The same track became the biggest hit of 2021 in the United States and globally without ever reaching #1, proving once and for all that the disputed #1 position on the Billboard Hot 100, that she still doesn't have reached, doesn't define the success of an artist. For Lipa, it seems that longevity is more important than an instant success.

Her song, ""Cold Heart""  with  Elton John and  PNAU, was one of the biggest hits of 2022. She had during that year a sold-out global stadium and arena tour with ""The Future Nostalgia Tour"", marking her as a definitive icon of the beginning of the 2020's decade, especially in the European continent, her main music market.

She began her third album cycle in 2024, while also making her acting debut that year with ""Barbie"" and ""Argylle"" in 2024. Her third album, ""Radical Optimism,"" was released on May 3rd, 2024. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Dua+Lipa"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

87,kodaline,1287633,26196701,"Kodaline is a Dublin-based Irish alternative rock quartet. Originally known as 21 Demands, the band made chart history in March 2007, when their debut single ""Give Me A Minute"" topped the Irish Singles Chart; becoming the first independently released track to achieve the feat. In 2005 the band made it to the final of RTE-broadcast programme 'You're a Star' in Ireland, coming in second place, and then in 2011 they changed their name to Kodaline. 

Growing up in houses just two minutes away from each other in Swords, a working class town near Dublin airport, Stephen Garrigan  and Mark Prendergast met aged eight, when they were the only boys in the school choir. Skip forward six years and they recruited Vinny May , also situated a stones throw away and together set about forming the first of myriad bands. The line-up for Kodaline was recently completed by the addition of bassist Jason Boland . The band's name, incidentally, means absolutely nothing. For the moment they wanted something they could take ownership of.

The band became a YouTube sensation with their music video for the song 'All I Want' which tells the heartbreaking beauty-and-the-beast type story. On October 4th 2013 Kodaline released another music video for this song called 'All I Want part 2"" this again tells us about the man. 

On June 17th 2013, Kodaline released their first studio album, In a Perfect World, with 11 tracks including 'All I Want', 'Pray', 'Love Like This' and 'High Hopes'. The oldest track on their album is 'High Hopes' which was based on a series of breakups that members of the band were facing during that time.

Teaching each other the principles of songcraft, the music they came up with some of which can be found on their self titled EP isn't wan or introspective or self-serving. Instead, it's bold, epic and stirring. Currently maintaining an air of understated mystery, Kodaline are soon set to unveil themselves to the world with these first four tracks recorded with Steve Harris (producer for Dave Matthews band, mixer for U2).

Singles have featured in a number of TV shows, including 'Remember the time' in Grey's Anatomy and 'All I Want' in ""The Vampire Diaries"". This song was also used ,very effectively, as the backing music in the 2012 Google Zeitgeist advert.

Also, on the 15th of January, Kodaline received the EBBA for the people's choice award along with another award for the best Irish Act.

While hanging out in his neighborhood, Meek met three guys and formed the group, “BloodHoundz,” which consisted of Mel Love, Dat Nigga Leel and Young Pooh. The group lasted for fives years and Meek ventured on his own.

With a solo career in tow, Meek became one of Philadelphia’s hottest underground rap artists on an independent label. In 2007, Meek debuted his Flamerz series, which stands for hottest songs and released his first mix tape, Flamerz 1, which featured the hit single, “In My Bag.”

In 2008, Meek debuted the highly anticipated Flamerz 2 –“Hottest In Da City,” which showcased more of his lyrical abilities with the singles, “So Fly,” “Prolli,” and “Hottest In Da City.” Upon release of Flamerz 2, it caught the attention of founder and President of 215Aphillyated Records, Charlie Mack. Mack was immediately impressed with Meek that he signed him to his management company. During the same year, he met the founder and owner of Grand Hustle, TI. TI was impressed with his lyrical ability that he offered him an opportunity to travel to Los Angeles to meet with him along with the Warner Brothers Records, within one week both record companies offered him a deal. Meek was overwhelmed by the offers; however, he felt collaborating with TI was an opportunity of a lifetime and chose his label. An ecstatic Meek was on top of the world; a record deal and the chance to work with one of hip hop’s greatest rappers and then a set back occurred. He was arrested, charged with a crime and order to serve seven months in jail.

Meek pre-released three singles from his third mix tape Flamerz 2.5 – “The Preview” in August of 2009, which featured the chart topping hits, “Make ‘Em Say,” “Imma Da Ish,” featuring Ms. Jade and “Starting Something,” in honor Michael Jackson. Within the first two weeks of its release, Clear Channel added it to their play list, which is an anomaly in the music business. In June of 2009, Meek began immediately working on his freshman album – Flamerz 3, “Hottest In America – Gangster Grill Edition,” hosted by DJ Drama and featuring the songs: “Baby Girl,” “Hottest In America,” and “I’m Killinem.” The highly anticipated cd is set to be released on January 19, 2010. Despite his stint in jail, Meek’s fans remained loyal, he currently boasts of 13 million hits on My Space and 20 million viewers on You Tube. Meek Mill has recently just signed to Rick Ross's Maybach Music Group.

In the future, Meek plans to establish the Meek Mill Foundation, which will mentor young males between the ages of 12-24 on the importance of “Education over Incarceration.” He gives a shoutout to the next artist coming up named shizz.. He also plans to collaborate with United Community Action Network and the Lifers of Graterford Prison to address the violence plaguing our cities.

2015 - BEEF WITH DRAKE
In July 2015 Meek attempted to air out Drake for ""not writing his own raps"" via popular social media site Twitter. These tweets resulted in a huge reaction from the hip hop community, however, the stunt went awry when Drake (Aubrey Graham) decided to respond. Drake released the diss track ""Charged Up"" during an Apple Music stream and an immediate response from Meek was demanded. Funkmaster Flex announced he would debut Meek's response live on Hot97. However, the track never came. After four days there was still no sign of a response from Meek, prompting Drake to release a second diss track ""Back To Back."" The response to this was huge and a harsh blow to Meek's career. Two days later Meek finally released ""Wanna Know."" This track received largely negative reviews and it was clear to most that Drake had won the beef. On August 2nd at the annual OVOfest, Drake truly roasted Meek Mill; performing ""Back To Back"" in front of various memes poking fun at Meek to a raucous Toronto crowd. Many fans believed this to be the nail in the coffin spelling the end for Meek's career.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Meek+Mill"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

90,sheck wes,735199,9884219,"Harlem and Milwaukee raised Senegalese rapper Sheck Wes' popularity started in the late 2010's, despite debuting almost a decade earlier. 

His debut single ""Live Sheck Wes"", released in 2016, found some moderate success on the streaming app SoundCloud.

He was later signed to a joint deal in 2018 with Kanye West's ""G.O.O.D. Music"" and Travis Scott's ""Cactus Jack"" label, and his debut project, ""MUDBOY"" was released on October 5th of that same year.

Despite not being a single, Travis Scott's ""ASTROWORLD"" album track alongside Juice WRLD and Sheck Wes titled ""No Bystanders"" charted in some countries, including the USA, where at #31 it was Wes' first entry in the country.

Following the track's mild success, the song ""Mo Bamba"", off his aforementioned debut album and inspired by his friendship with the basketball player of the same name, became a smash hit over a year after its release, reaching the top positions of charts all around the world, including a #5 in Canada and a #6 in the USA.

Part of the single's popularity was due to an Internet meme were Know-it-all, a character from the animated 2004 film ""Polar Express"", was supposedly asking a group of people if they wanted to hear the above-mentioned hit single by Sheck Wes or label mate Travis Scott's track ""SICKO MODE"".

His following singles ""Do That"", ""Chippi Chippi"" and ""Enzo (with DJ Snake featuring Offset, Gucci Mane and 21 Savage)"" failed to enter any important charts. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sheck+Wes"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

91,gucci mane,2399227,50610363,"Radric Davis (born February 12, 1980 in Birmingham, Alabama), better known by his stage name Gucci Mane, is an American rapper and CEO of 1017 Brick Squad Records. In 2005 he released his independent debut album, Trap House, which featured the successful single ""Icy"" that he recorded with Young Jeezy. He has since released a further three albums including 2006's Hard To Kill, 2007's Trap-A-Thon and 2007's Back To The Trap House. His sixth studio album, The State vs Radric Davis, was released in December 2009, just weeks after he was sent back to prison for 12 months for violating his probation. He was released in May 2010 and will now release his seventh studio album, The Appeal: Georgia's Most Wanted, sometime at the end of 2010.

It’s said that art mirrors life. In hip-hop’s case, there’s always been a deliberate entanglement of perception and reality. Fans demand their MCs be real…but never too real. Successful hip-hop is about the hint of the danger, the tease of it, the mystique. Hip-hop is about balance.

Gucci Mane is an artist striving for that balance, volatility versus musicality. Controversy, including a feud with former collaborator Young Jeezy, has grabbed the headlines, with insufficient regard paid to his considerable mic skills, raw talent, and business acumen. Gucci is looking to wrest his name from public speculation and let his own words do the talking.

“I wish everybody well who’s making money in this rap game,” the Atlanta-raised rapper says, dismissing the controversy that followed him in the past. “My own rap game is going so good, I’ve got so many things on my plate at my label, that I don’t got time for other people’s business.” With a deal with Asylum Records as the boss of his own label, So Icey Entertainment, Gucci does indeed have a full schedule with no time to dwell on the past.

“I live my life with no regrets. I just wish that a lot of things never happened, but anybody can wish,” says Gucci. Sounds like a man with his eyes on the prize. And you’d expect nothing less from an artist who ground his way to the top via the hustle of independent records. Signing to Big Cat Records in the wake of his local single “Black Tee,” he dropped his debut record, Trap House, in May 2005. The independent album moved an impressive 140,000 units, largely on the strength of the “Icy” single, featuring Jeezy. Clamor over song rights sparked dispute, and the resulting rift grew.

Controversy notwithstanding, Mane’s independence was cemented: “I was on the independent scene for about two years,” he recalls. “It’s crazy! You gotta go into your own pocket to support your craft. You need other avenues to have money coming in, to support your stuff. You might win, you might lose, and it’s a gamble out there with the independent circuit. One thing you’d better have is good music because without that, you go downhill fast in the independent game.”

Good music firmly in hand, Gucci was fast approaching stardom when more tragedy befell him. But let’s backtrack; how did the man born Radric Davis in Bessemer, Alabama, become Gucci Mane, mouthpiece for Atlanta stuntin’? Mane remembers little from his time in Alabama, just that it was rural, and that it’s changed dramatically since he left at the age of nine. “I gotta shout out Alabama though, because they holdin’ it down,” he affirms. “Every time I go there to do a show, I’m impressed with how hip-hop culture has taken root.”

Mane’s identity coalesced when he moved with his mother to Atlanta. “I lived all of my adolescent and adult life in Atlanta,” he explains. “I’m from East Atlanta Zone Six; it was hard, man, it was real rough. I grew up in the Starter jacket era: they’d take your Starter jacket, your 8Ball jacket, they’d take your hat, your shoes. It was just no holds barred on the streets, dog eat dog. If you missed the bus, you had to be crewed up or you’d get jumped. It was wild when I came up.”

It’s a bleak portrait. When asked to describe his home life more vividly, Mane offers a look into his contemplative side, a side honed as a schoolyard poet. “I was just a young dude in a single parent house most of my life. I can’t complain that much. I would guess it’s like any black child growing up in a single parent household. There are a lot of people who know how that is. I didn’t have a lot coming up; but what I did have, I appreciated. I was blessed to have a caring mother to raise me right and to help me with my business ventures; she’s been there through the whole struggle. There’s a lot that goes along with that; it made me who I am today.”

A stepfather would enter the picture during Mane’s adolescence, introducing not only a male figure, but also inspiration for Mane’s unusual moniker. “My father came in, the original Gucci Mane; that’s what people in the neighborhood called him, and that’s where I get my name from. From then on, I grew up the son of a hustler and a schoolteacher; it was the best of both worlds because I was educated twice.” Drawing inspiration from a pantheon of rappers before him –Big Daddy Kane, LL Cool J, Ice Cube, the Beastie Boys, N.W.A—Mane went on to release Trap House, a lethal brew of his signature sound: “I call my music straight Gucci: going hard and whatever beats you make you for me, if I’m feeling it, if I’m rocking with it, I’m gonna crush it. When you hear me, you hear a lot of pain, a lot of hood; you hear what’s going on in the inner city in Atlanta.”

Unfortunately, Trap House was ill timed; the month of its release, Gucci was accused of murder and jailed for two days. Eventually deemed to be acting in self-defense, and without sufficient evidence to hold him, Mane was exonerated. But the ordeal left an indelible imprint on the man. “I learned to keep better company, watch where I go, and be mindful of my surroundings at all times,” he reveals. “Watch what I say, watch what I do and how I do it, just keep myself out of the wrong crowd.”

“I always stand up man,” he continues. “I’m one of the toughest guys I know. It’ll take a lot more than that to break me down.” Undeterred, Mane was back in the studio, preparing 2006’s eerily apropos Hard To Kill. The buzz from Hard To Kill vaulted Gucci Mane from regional commodity to national treasure, and major labels responded accordingly: “There was a bidding war going on, and I liked Atlantic’s approach. They made it known that they wanted me, they felt where I was going and that I could grow with them.”

Asylum/Atlantic Records welcomed Gucci Mane in early ’07, granting him his own imprint, So Icey Entertainment. With it comes an entire stable of artists, the So Icey Boyz. As the Boyz ready for their own exposure –“I got them in training; they be in the weight room, pumping iron, doing pushups, shopping at the mall, buying ice”—Gucci is focused on his magnum opus, Back to the Trap House. “I started working on the album, and by the third song, I was like ‘This is going back to the Trap House.’ I started feeling the same way I did when I made my first album. It had the same feel to it, the same freshness. And I had the same hunger and desire I had when I first started rapping.”

“Since I went major, I want everybody to know I’m still keeping it street, keeping it hood,” Gucci maintains. “I’m trying to take it back to all my fans that I had when I first started my career. And at the same time, I’m trying to open up my new album to a new fan base. So it’s a mix for everybody coming together, like my first album was.” Gucci has always prided himself on his innate ability, and his refusal to let guest appearances dictate the tone of his records. “I just want people to know I’m a great songwriter, man,” he asserts. “I’m passionate about what I do, and it’s choreographed strategically when I do it. I bring a lot of experience, creative wordplay, and a crazy style. And my albums, I record most of the songs without writing them down; it’s a God-given gift and I just get paid for it. It come from God, it’s like wondering what makes a bird fly. He made me a poet like the great poets of the past.”

But don’t mistake Gucci’s confidence for self-absorption. The vicissitudes of his career have dictated a longer view. Lyrics aside, he’s less preoccupied with visible means and more so with acting as an emissary from his under-repped block. “I’m not the one to glorify what goes on in the hood,” he insists. “We have everything there, the whole range from violence to people getting on the bus and going to work. There’s a lot more to the hood than just drugs. It’s a bigger story, there’s a big picture. I went to school in that neighborhood, I worked there, I trapped there, I hustled there, and I got my name there. I’m proud to be from East Atlanta Zone Six, and I claim there. I hold that on my back and carry that, to be the first one from there to really rock.”

And Gucci’s professional aims have matured as well. While other rappers stress platinum plaques, Gucci hasn’t forgotten the route he took to stardom. “I made a lot of CDs on my own. People fucked with me and supported me, and just made me the man I am today. That’s my blueprint right there, and I stay mindful of it. So now, my only concern is that people feel my music; at the end of the day, I do it for people to feel it. If one person feel it, two people feel it, I feel like my job’s been done.”

Fortunately for Gucci, he should be prepared to welcome an army of new fans with Back to the Trap House. But longstanding fans shouldn’t fear; they’ll recognize “Freaky Gurl,” reprised from its previous appearance from Hard To Kill. Luda, upon hearing the joint, asked for a guest spot on the remix. Said remix now appears as the lead single on Back to the Trap House, following in Gucci’s theme of mating old and new. Over a bouncing, meandering beat from Cyber Sapp, the two cook up the requisite concoction of whips, chips, and chicks. Also look out for “Bird Flu,” the album’s number two single, laced by New-York based Supa Sonics. Elsewhere, firm guest verses from Rich Boy and Pimp C of UGK round out Gucci’s regional flavor, while Bay-area producer Zaytoven (of “Icy” renown) locks down Gucci’s West Coast appeal.

Gucci Mane has something for everyone, and with the struggles of the past in his rearview, Gucci is settled in for his ride to the top. “I’m best known for controversy but I’m trying to gain respect as a songwriter and entertainer. I plan to hit them so hard with this album; who knows what the future will bring. I’ll be banging them out till I can’t bang no more.”

92,sherine,142865,2706655,"Sherine Abdul Wahhab, (Arabic: شيرين عبد الوهاب, also credited as Sherine Ahmed) is an Egyptian singer, born October 10, 1980 in Cairo. She is popularly known simply as Sherine شيرين (AKA Shereen, Sherin). She started her musical career with her successful debut single, ""Ah Ya Leil"".

Born in Cairo, Sherine is a graduate of a prominent Egyptian music academy. Upon graduating, she sought a record company to represent her and manage her musical career. She met up with Free Music Productions' owner and manager Nasr Mahrous. Mahrous signed and released a debut album with fellow singer Tamer Hosny. The album included solo singles, as well as duets. Titled Free Mix 3, it is one of the mix-tapes Mahrous usually produces but was exclusively for these two artists. Although Sherine was a new artist with Free Music, Tamer had signed with Mahrous earlier.

The album included Sherine's debut single, ""Ah Ya Leil"", which garnered huge success in Egypt and throughout the Middle East. Critics and audience were impressed with Sherine's vocal abilities, but wanted her to revamp her image. The song included local musical styles from traditional Egyptian tarab voice techniques to usage of traditional Egyptian music instruments common to the Shaabi genre. Hosny's single, along with the music video, were also received very well and this mixtape was considered a milestone in Free Music's short history.

in 2002, Sherine released her first album as a solo artist titled Garh Tany. The album's first single was the title track, ""Garh Tany"", and it was well-received. The single consisted mainly of repetition, with intensive manipulation in voice tones and pitch. This is also considered to be a traditional Egyptian voice technique. The music video was released one week earlier from the album release, and the album made huge success in the Egyptian and wider Middle Eastern music market. By North American standards, the album would be the equivalent of certified platinum.

Sherine's second single from the album was ""Sabri Aleel"", which was an uptempo song, uses slight traditional techniques, but included Nai, Tabla, Heavy Bass and multi-layered voices of Sherine in the choruses. The music video's version of the song was different from the album's, and it was titled ""Sabri Aleel - Melody Mix"". The song was exclusively broadcast on Melody Hits channel.

Sherine's acting career is short, as she just starred in one comedy movie titled Medo Mashakel. In the movie, Sherine sings and one of the singles sung in the movie was broadcasted on music channels. The song was titled ""Balak"". It portrays Sherine, as one of the movie's scenes, getting on stage in a friend's wedding and performing the song. The song didn't get as much attention, as it wasn't released on any record.

A compilation album for Sherine was released under the title Roo'. The album included the movie-song ""Balak"", along with few other songs of her such as ""Afriqiya"" and other songs of Tamer Hosny. The album was considered unofficial, as it wasn't released under Free Music label since Sherine was still signed with the company.

By this time, and before releasing the single ""Ma Btefrahsh"", it was reported in magazines and tabloid-newspapers that Sherine was having a fall-out with Nasr Mahrous, but it was not confirmed. Sherine was on hiatus during that time, as she didn't release any singles nor albums for quite a while, and according to some sources, Sherine was mad at her producer and manager, Nasr Mahrous, for not fulfilling the terms of agreement in their contract.

In early 2005, Promotions for Sherine's new song, ""Ma Btefrahsh"" showed up on Melody Hits, and a week later the music video was released. The song became quite popular, and it was heavily rotated on Melody Hits. The song was almost like a comeback to Sherine. It was featured in a mixtape along other singles by fellow Free Music artists, such as Bahaa Sultan, Soma and Tamer Hosny. The mixtape featured another single by Sherine, ""Einak"". Both songs were frequently aired on Radio channels.

In August 2005, Sherine's new single was also promoted on Melody Hits TV, and it seemed certain that this was going to be one of the album releases as she had said earlier in TV interviews. The promotion shows a camera following Sherine's bare feet walking, up to a chair where she sits, but it doesn't show her face. Another promo had a sample from her second single ""Mafeesh Marra"".

More than a week later, the single, titled ""Lazim Aïsh"" was released. It was also produced and directed by Nasr Mahrous, the song took a different form as it was a ballad. This was the title track as well. The album, Lazim Aïsh, was released. The album also would be certified platinum as it was wildly successful. It was the best selling album in the Arab World in 2005. Later on, the second single music video of ""Mafeesh Marra"" was released, it was an uptempo, fun, hip song which the audience were delighted by its new and unique sound.

In spring 2006, Sherine was chosen to perform the songs for the movie ‘An al-Ishq wa’al-Hawa. The movie’s theme song, Keteer Bi’she’, was a major hit in Arabic music channels.

Recently, she released ""Lebnan Fel Alb (Lebanon's in the Heart)"". It is dedicated to Lebanon and the victims who fell in the Israeli-Lebanese conflict. The music video is made up of footage of the damage in Lebanon after the recent war. It also includes video footage of tourist spots of the country.

94,armin van buuren,1607100,55885171,"Armin van Buuren (born Armin Jozef Jacobus Daniël van Buuren, December 25, 1976) is a trance (mostly progressive trance and uplifting trance) music producer and DJ from the Netherlands. His musical career started in 1995.

He has been named number one in the prestigious DJ MAG Top 100 poll four times in a row, from 2007 till 2010 and for the 5th time in 2012. He's the first DJ in the history of the DJ Magazine to achieve that and an indication of his prolific output over more than 14 years he’s been dj’ing and producing. Being the official World’s Most Popular DJ is just one of his many achievements, but the driving force behind his success is an overriding passion for electronic dance music.

2008 began with the success that the number one DJ seems to attract; he was awarded with the prestigious Buma Cultuur Pop Award in January. This was followed by being voted as the Best Trance Artist in the Beatport Music Awards in March; judged on the musician’s artistic achievements, national and international success, it is evident that Armin van Buuren has become one of the decade’s most influential trance acts.

Even a basic list of recent successes reads like a lifetime of work: ‘Best Album’ for artist album ‘Shivers’ at both the Dutch Release Dance Awards and the prestigious Edison Awards; ‘Best Compilation’ for ‘A State Of Trance’, in 2006, claiming the ‘Best European DJ’ award in 2007 and ‘Best Mix Radio Show’ at the Miami Winter Music Conference in 2006 and 2007, for radio show ‘A State Of Trance’ – now broadcasting on a massive 40 FM stations as well as satellite and internet radio, with over 26 million listeners a week; a 5th year residency in Ibiza at Amnesia and over 50,000 downloads every week from podcasting high end chart-bothering positions all over the world for singles, albums and compilations , with single “Rush Hour” used as the theme tune to the UEFA European Youth Championship; the #1 entry in the Dutch album charts with his artist album ‘Imagine’, the #1 entry of the DVD registration of ‘Armin Only ‘ Imagine’ – the landmarks just keep coming!

The 350th episode and the 7th year of the hit radio show ‘A State of Trance’ was celebrated in May 2008 with an eight hour live broadcast from Antwerp in Belgium to over 40 radio stations internationally. Fans were invited to a free party with a line up that had been voted for by the show’s listeners; another example of the importance the DJ places on the satisfaction of his fans. Considering the popularity of the radio show the introduction of ‘A State of Trance Podcast’ was a natural progression. The weekly podcasts which contain highlights and Armin’s favourite tracks from the previous episode ensure that trance lovers across the world will never miss another episode!
Sold-out shows for Armin Only in 2005 and 2006 created eager anticipation of the third edition, which kicked off in a sold-out Jaarbeurs in Utrecht in 2008; over 16,000 fans attended and were enthralled by the DJ’s nine hour set. The theme of the night was ‘Imagine’, described by Armin as “the celebration of our sensations both in life and in clubland.” Fans all around the world should not despair, as ‘Armin Only’ tour dates have also been set for Romania, Poland, Belgium and Australia; the DJ will also be touring in England, Scotland, Ibiza, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, and the USA, with expected dates in, for an example, the Czech Republic.

Born in Leiden, Holland (on December 25, 1976) to a musical family, Armin indulged his passion for music from a young age. He spent all the money he earned with his paper round on records. His mum won a computer when he was 10, gaining Armin’s interest. “So as a little nerdy kid I was writing my own basic programmes, and learnt about the technology from there.” He progressed from making low-profile mix tapes for friends to higher profile mixes when he discovered experimenting with different sequences on his computer through his uncle. “I was so stunned by what I saw him doing on the computer, that I got addicted to creating music right there and then!”
“I loved dance music immediately – this great rebellious sound that was so different to the ‘beautiful’ songs of the years before”. Armin cites electronic pioneer Jean Michel Jarre as a major influence (famed for his awesome visuals as well as his groundbreaking synth sounds), as well as Dutch producer Ben Liebrand, who later mentored him in his mixing and producing.
In the early days, Armin thought it was wise to have something extra in case the DJ’ing didn’t work out. So he studied for a law degree. The final year of his course was inevitably stretched as he juggled his studies with his increasingly hectic schedule; his rise to fame included lots of productions and remixes, as well as playing out to packed clubs every weekend. It took him three years to graduate, but his determination made him succeed!

Armin’s own productions have all made a huge impact and quickly gain worldwide acclaim; his latest artist album titled ‘Imagine’ entered the Dutch Album Top 100 Chart at number one; this is the first time a dance producer has ever accomplished such a feat in the history of Dutch music. The first single to be taken from this album, ‘Going Wrong’ with DJ Shah featuring Chris Jones, entered the Dutch Singles Chart at number five. The ‘Armin Only DVD’ was also released and reached the acclaimed number one spot in its second week. His back catalogue includes Blue Fear, Communication, Sound of Goodbye, Shivers, Rush Hour, Burned With Desire, Exhale, Love You More, This World Is Watching Me, and Yet Another Day. While the remix offers flood in, Armin only takes on tracks that he really loves. He uses exactly the same criteria for his compilations, meaning that every release from Armin or his long-running Armind label is a bone fide stormer that’s earned its place. His output includes tracks for the cult TV series 24, and the likes of Motorcycle’s As The Rush Comes.
Armin is a dedicated trance lover, but isn’t imprisoned by a single genre, saying “What makes trance work so well is that it doesn’t stick to one style, and can incorporate electro, minimal, whatever it likes.” His desire to showcase more of the great music he hears, along with the number of people sending him tracks they wanted to release, led to the obvious step of starting his own label, Armada, in 2003.

The label is a joint venture between Armin, Maykel Piron (former head of A&R for Warner Music) and David Lewis, who'd previously managed Armin. ""What we wanted was a company that could offer everything for an artist: representation, a booking agency, and a record company. Artists can choose full management, or to just release a record or play out at gigs. Armada lets the artists choose what they want without telling them what to do"".
Armin is now a fully-fledged artist in his own right, having made his songwriting debut on his album, the award-winning Shivers; The events continue to get bigger and bigger, and Armin regularly headlines the likes of Sensation White, Global Gathering, Dance Valley, ZoukOut, Mysteryland, Coachella, Beats In Brazil, Trance Energy, Fort Dance, Summer Days – basically whether you’re in Australia, Russia, the Middle East, the US or Europe, you can catch Armin van Buuren at a club or festival near you!

96,tom misch,681498,17816974,"“Apparently, I have a sound , and people can hear it,” Tom Misch claims modestly. For someone with a cohesive and sprawling body of mellow beats behind him, he seems mildly bewildered that this is the case. “I try so many genres that it’s hard sometimes to pinpoint. I guess my sound is uplifting, soulful, funky — and happy more than it is sad.” It’s a perfect description of his debut album, due in 2018, which brings together low-slung hip-hop beats, glittering disco, and noodling jazz instrumentation in a way only Misch can.

If Misch seems surprised, it’s because his fanbase has developed naturally. He never set out with any grand plan when he began making beats, and uploading roughly three tracks a week to Soundcloud at 16. “ I prefer a more organic approach to making music, but also to building a fanbase,” he reflects. “I don’t want a big push on my music as I don’t want to be as big as possible.” And yet, he’s rapidly become one of the U.K.’s most exciting emerging new artists, gaining 1.1 million monthly listeners on Spotify and playing a sold-out tour of the U.K., U.S. and Europe in 2016. Collaborating with a clutch of fellow trailblazers like Novelist, Loyle Carner, and Zak Abel, he’s accumulated a total of 75 million streams across all platforms to date — and it all started in his bedroom.

Misch’s earliest introduction to music came via his artistic family, including his psychiatrist father, a passionate violinist, who would take him to concerts and the opera as a child. He sang in a choir at school, and picked up the violin himself at the age of four. When one of his older sisters took up guitar and later abandoned it, nine-year-old Misch inherited the instrument, and taught himself to play Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Nirvana songs. Today, he also plays bass, banjo, and a smattering of keys.

It was one of his sister’s boyfriends who introduced him to the music of J Dilla at 15, and from then on, Misch was hooked. He took up Music Technology at school the following year, and began learning how to create his own “really chilled out, boom-bap kind of ‘90s hip-hop” on Logic Pro. “When I wasn’t at school, I’d be making beats,” he says. “It was just what I did.” As he began sharing his tunes on Soundcloud, he found the response was overwhelming. “You put songs out and you build a fanbase — it’s kind of addictive.”

A collaboration with his sister Laura, on the jazz-inflected “Follow,” was a major turning point for both siblings after it was uploaded to influencer YouTube channel Majestic Casual. The track features Laura on sax and Tom on beats and vocals, intertwined to mesmeric effect. “That was the point where I was like, okay, maybe I could do this as a career,” Misch reflects. “Suddenly it had 100,000 plays.” Shortly afterward, Soulection co-founder Joe Kay commented on one of Misch’s productions on Soundcloud, asking the teenage prodigy to guest on his radio show.

Soon afterward, in 2014, Misch contributed to Soulection’s White Label series, weaving together obscure jazz samples, guitar, and vocals to create the perfect summer listen (including the dreamy fan favourite “The Journey”). His Beat Tape series collected the best of his hip-hop instrumentals, the 5 Day Mischon project featured collaborations with grime MC Novelist and singer-songwriter Zak Abel, and his 2016 Reverie EP brought the official release of Misch’s most sophisticated songs to date. As well as soulful singers Carmody and Jordan Rakei, he struck up a collaborative relationship with fellow south Londoner Loyle Carner, whose mellow bars flow over Misch’s productions like a breeze on a hot day. Both artists form part of the much-hyped scene of singer-songwriters emerging from south east London, including King Krule and Cosmo Pyke. Each has a DIY mindset and a brooding, poetic approach to lyricism that weaves them loosely together. “There’s definitely a certain sound,” reflects Misch. “Everyone’s music in south London is really chilled. It reflects the vibe of this part of London — it’s laid back.”

Misch has lived in south London all his life, and he loves it so much that his new single, “South of the River,” is dedicated to it. “I much prefer the general vibe of south London,” he says. “I love this area, Peckham, Dulwich, Forest Hill. Singing that line — You should come south of the river — it just felt really good.” With its string arrangements mirroring disco synth stabs and a funky bassline, it’s an irresistible bop that nods clearly to Misch’s danceable new direction.

One of the biggest influences on Misch’s sound has long been jazz. With a degree in jazz guitar, Misch is an avid listener of Robert Glasper, Roy Hargrove, Cory Henry, and jazz-influenced songwriters like D’Angelo and Erykah Badu. “It’s kind of a warm feeling, when you hear a certain chord progression,” he explains.

In the making of his debut album, he’s also been drawing on inspiration from disco, house, and techno, discovered through the portal of producers like Kaytranada and Motor City Drum Ensemble. The euphoric feel of 1970s and ‘80s disco (think Earth Wind and Fire or Gwen McCrae), and the thump of nightclubs like Fabric or Corsica, inspired him to bring more movement into his songs. “I want people to dance at my live shows, I want to bring more energy,” he says. “When you’re in a club and you can feel the bass...I want people to have that experience.”

Misch’s sound is true to its roots — he still makes his tracks in the same bedroom studio in his parents’ house, and his mum produces his artwork. (“ Her work is very DIY, just like my music, and feels homespun,” he explains.) But he’s never afraid to explore new territory. “I think it’s really important to make music that hasn’t been made before,” he says. “I’m trying to work out what my sound is, and pursuing that.” Fans might think they know his style, but Misch is a restless experimentalist, keen to spend endless hours honing his craft. One of his favorite new songs is a “Brazilian-sounding” jam that reflects how deeply he feels about his work. As he puts it: “It’s about how you can’t take away my love for music. I’ll always have that.” <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Misch"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

97,kina grannis,524897,6061950,"Kina Kasuya Grannis (born August 4, 1985, of Japanese, English, Irish, French, and German descent) is a Japanese-American guitarist and singer-songwriter from Orange County, CA. She started performing in 2001 after getting over her shyness. Kina independently released her first full-length album, Stairwells, on February 23, 2010. Her music is both sweet and melancholy, but always filled with hope. 

Kina started playing shows at the age of four in front of her stuffed animals. Now she plays in front of people, though it wasn’t the quickest transition for the admittedly shy songstress. While attending college at USC, Kina often retreated to the secluded stairwells around campus where she could write and sing without being heard. Protected by their quiet confines, she found a safe haven and a creative outlet for her music. Armed with a guitar and a cup of tea, Kina wrote in every stairwell she came across. And it was within these stairwells that she developed her confidence as a songwriter and her poise as a performer.

In 2007, Kina joined YouTube, made a music video and entered herself into a contest. A few months later, her video for “Message From Your Heart” aired during the Superbowl and its 97 million viewers (or 194 million eyeballs, depending on how you’re keeping track) and she walked away with a record deal. Since then, Kina has regularly posted her songs on YouTube, amassing many millions of views, and toured throughout North America. Her songs have been heard on television shows such as ABC’s General Hospital and MTV’s College Life. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kina+Grannis"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

On June 13, Migos released their mixtape Y.R.N. (Young Rich N***as), which features the lead single ""Versace"", to critical acclaim. Brandon Soderberg of Spin gave it 8 out of 10 stars, commenting that it ""is a super-cut of Dirty South vibes"" and compared the three members to Gucci Mane, Soulja Boy, and Future.

On October 28, 2016, Migos released the first single of their new album Culture. The single was titled ""Bad and Boujee"". The song was produced by Metro Boomin and features vocals from fellow American rapper Lil Uzi Vert. The music video for the single was released on October 31. The single went on to top the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Migos' first number one single in the US. Their second album, Culture, was released on January 27, 2017. In April 2017, Migos were featured on Katy Perry  song ""Bon Appétit"" from her fifth studio album, Witness.

The album contains twenty-four tracks, featuring production from Metro Boomin, Dun Deal, Murda Beatz, Travis Scott, Zaytoven and others.

In October 2018, Quavo stated that Culture III would be released in early 2019. The album was then delayed and re-scheduled for release in early 2020. However, the album was pushed back again, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Quavo spoke to Billboard in March 2020, and announced the group's decision to hold off on the release of Culture III, explaining it was largely due to their inability to properly roll out the album once social distancing rules went into effect in most states in the US. Instead, the group will first release Quarantine Mixtape in the lead-up to Culture III. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Migos"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

106,twice,1323055,367055960,"There are numerous artists who have performed under the name Twice:

1. TWICE (Korean: 트와이스; Japanese: トゥワイス)  is a nine-member South Korean girl group formed by JYP Entertainment through the 2015 reality show SIXTEEN. The group is composed of: Nayeon (나연), Jeongyeon (정연), Momo (모모), Sana (사나), Jihyo (지효), Mina (미나), Dahyun (다현), Chaeyoung (채영) and Tzuyu (쯔위). 

On February 11, 2015, Park Jin-young announced that the lineup of JYP Entertainment's upcoming seven-member girl group would be decided through SIXTEEN, a competition survival show that would air on Mnet later that year. The show began on May 5 and ended with Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung as the winners. Park then announced that he would be increasing the size of the group from seven members to nine by adding Tzuyu, who was the ""audience's pick"" since she was the most popular contestant by the show's end, and Momo, who was added by Park himself since he felt the group needed someone with her performance abilities. The decision was controversial at the time with many people complaining about eliminated contestants being able to join the group.

The group debuted on October 20, 2015 with the extended play The Story Begins and title track ""OOH-AHH하게"". TWICE rose to fame in 2016 with their single ""CHEER UP"" from their second mini Page Two; the song charted at number 1 on the Gaon Digital Chart and became the best-performing single of the year. It also won the title of ""Song of the Year"" at two major music awards shows: Melon Music Awards and Mnet Asian Music Awards. Their subsequent single ""TT"" from their third extended play TWICEcoaster : LANE 1 claimed the top spot for four consecutive weeks. The album was the highest selling K-pop girl group album of 2016, which sold 350,852 copies by the end of the year. Within 19 months after debut, Twice has sold over 1.2 million units of their four extended plays and special albums.

On January 3, 2017, the music video for ""TT"" hit 100 million views, becoming the fastest K-pop group music video to do so and breaking Twice's own record previously set by ""Cheer Up"". Later in that same year, ""TT"" would also become the first video by a K-pop female act to surpass 200 million views. On January 10, JYP Entertainment announced Twice's first solo concert tour within just a year and four months after debuting in October 2015. The three-day sold-out concert titled Twice 1st Tour: Twiceland – The Opening was held on February 17–19 at the SK Olympic Handball Gymnasium. A tour across Thailand and Singapore was also scheduled after the first stop in Seoul. After the Korean leg of the concert tour, Twice released a reissue of their third mini on February 20 titled TWICEcoaster: Lane 2 along with its lead single, ""Knock Knock"". The album sold 266,645 units in February 2017 alone. The title track was regarded as one of the best songs of 2017 by many critics at the end of the year.

In April, JYP Entertainment announced that Twice would be releasing a new Korean album in May before heading to Japan. On May 15, Twice released their fifth extended play SIGNAL. The title track ""Signal"" was produced by Park Jin-young, the founder of their entertainment label. This marks their first collaboration with Park. The mini contained six tracks, including ""Eye Eye Eyes""--co-written by members Jihyo and Chaeyoung—and ""Only 너 (Only You)"" written by former Wonder Girls' member HA:TFELT.

The group officially debuted in Japan on June 28, 2017 under Warner Music Japan with the release of their first compilation album titled #TWICE.

In 2012, the pair met on SoundCloud and struck up a musical connection, leading Shpresa Lleshaj to travel from Stockholm to Minneapolis to meet Cole Randall in person. They returned to Sweden together and immediately began work as Flora Cash. 

They released their debut EP, Mighty Fine, on December 12, 2012. Their second EP, Made It for You, came out on June 13, 2013. That year, Lleshaj and Randall also married. A third EP, I Will Be There, followed on September 20, 2014.

After independently releasing a handful of songs and two EPs, the pair signed with Swedish label Icons Creating Evil Art, after which they released, Can Summer Love Last Forever?, in March 2016. The seven-song mini-LP earned them nominations for two GAFFA awards, as Swedish Artist of the Year and Swedish Newcomer of the Year.

Flora Cash broke into the mainstream with their song “You’re Somebody Else”; a track from their debut full-length album, Nothing Lasts Forever (And It’s Fine), which Steve Baltin, writing for Forbes Magazine called “arguably the most intriguing song on radio this past year.”. The song reached #1 on Alternative Radio and achieved RIAA Platinum Certification in the United States.

The duo performed several times on American television after making their debut on The Late Late Show with James Corden and toured with Sir Sly, Joywave, lovelytheband, Judah & the Lion and AJR throughout 2018 and 2019.

In early 2020, Flora Cash released ‘Baby, It’s Okay’ on Sony’s RCA Records, which featured Billboard charting singles ‘Missing Home’ and ‘They Own This Town.' <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Flora+Cash"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

121,the chainsmokers,2274786,69111497,"A production duo featuring Andrew Taggart and Alex Pall, the Chainsmokers mix dance and pop into a chart-topping sound that spawned hits like ""Roses,"" ""Closer,"" and ""Don't Let Me Down."" Pall and Taggart first made a name for themselves by creating remixes of their favorite indie bands that garnered tens of millions of streams. The duo released its official debut single, ""#Selfie,"" which celebrated and skewered 2010s narcissism, in January 2014. The track's bouncy beats and self-obsessed words hit number one on the Billboard dance chart and sold over ten million copies. Meanwhile, ""#Selfie""'s video featured cameos by Snoop Dogg and David Hasselhoff, fueling the song's viral popularity to hundreds of millions of views. More singles, including ""Kanye"" and ""Let You Go,"" followed.

In 2015, they issued the Bouquet EP on Disruptor Records, a softer and more indie-flavored effort that featured the single ""Roses,"" which was certified double-platinum and hit number one on the Top Dance Songs chart. The song also earned the Chainsmokers nominations for the Billboard Music Awards in the Top Dance/Electronic Artist and Top Dance/Electronic Song categories. After playing over 300 shows in 2015, including dates at festivals like Lollapalooza, Firefly, Tomorrowland, and Ultra, the duo returned in 2016 with the platinum-certified ""Don't Let Me Down,"" a collaboration with Pittsburgh pop singer Daya that topped the Billboard dance chart and would later win a Grammy. That year, the Chainsmokers also performed as part of the Tilt Tour, the first ever fan-sourced tour. In addition, Pall and Taggart host two SiriusXM shows: Nice Hair, a monthly mix; and the weekly YouTube EDM 15.

The follow-up single to ""Don't Let Me Down"" would carry the duo to new heights. Featuring Halsey on vocals, ""Closer"" began its slow climb to the top of the singles chart in the summer of 2016. Once it hit number one, it remained in the top spot for over ten weeks, breaking the record previously held by Drake's ""One Dance."" As their chart dominance continued, they released the Collage EP, which joined their two Top Three singles with new collaborations featuring Phoebe Ryan, XYLØ, and Charlee.

122,vansire,1436274,31245916,"Vansire is a dream pop band from Rochester, Minnesota consisting of Josh Augustin and Sam Winemiller. They are currently signed to Spirit Goth Records. Vansire has performed at ROCKChester and First Avenue, played a live session with Audiotree, and collaborated with artists such as Chester Watson, Jeremiah Jae, and Mick Jenkins.

Vansire formed as band members Josh Augustin (vocals, synths, guitar, and drums) and Sam Winemiller (bass, guitar, and synths) were attending Century High School in Rochester, Minnesota. Augustin and Winemiller met while playing together on the school's drumline and continued to find themselves performing together through school activities (such as concert band and pit orchestra), something the duo says contributed to their creative synergy and friendship, which later helped in Vansire's formation.

In the summer of 2015, Winemiller approached Augustin after practice for the school's drumline with an idea to make a band ""that sounds like Mac [DeMarco]"". The pair's early recordings were made by holding instruments to the internal microphone of an iPad running GarageBand. Augustin and Winemiller, initially unsure of what to call their new project, turned to an online random word generator that landed on ""vansire"", an alternative name for the Marsh mongoose. From there, the two continued to record together in their basements, living rooms, and bedrooms under the new Vansire moniker.

In August 2016, Vansire self-released their first album, ""Reflections and Reveries"". The duo recorded the album entirely in Winemiller's basement in a roughly one-year period from August 2015 to August 2016, and included Winemiller's brother, Issac, on bass for some songs.

During this time, Augustin began studying at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and Oberlin College, while Winemiller started at the University of Minnesota. Despite the distance, the duo vowed to remain committed to the Vansire project, now describing it as ""a long-distance band relationship.""

Vansire released their second album Angel Youth in April 2018 on Spirit Goth Records. Augustin and Winemiller produced and mastered the album themselves, and it is the band's first full-length album that featured collaborations with other artists.

In June 2019, the duo released their single ""Metamodernity"", also recording an Audiotree Live session at Audiotree's studios in Chicago later that August.

In July 2020, Vansire released ""Central Time"", a single featuring Chicago-based rapper Mick Jenkins in their first collaboration together. In an interview announcing the single, Augustin said the single began as an instrumental demo that Winemiller sent him in September 2019, which sat untouched for roughly eight months until the duo returned back to it, finishing it up at the beginning of June 2020.

During this period of the band's history, Augustin said that Vansire found itself leaning in an ""increasingly dance-oriented direction"" with regard to musical sound and that the duo has started to draw influence from more ""dancey, funk-imbued music"".

On October 16, 2020, Vansire released ""After Fillmore County"", a seven-song EP that brought back FLOOR CRY, and featured Philadelphia-based rapper Ivy Sole. In April 2021, Vansire released a remix of Sydney-based producer-artist Swaine Delgado's ""F Me Up"", their first remix. In May 2022, Vansire released their third LP, The Modern Western World"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Vansire"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

124,exo,832875,136435045,"There are several artists or groups with this name:

1. EXO (Korean: 엑소) is a Chinese-South Korean boy band based in Seoul. Formed by S.M. Entertainment in 2011, the group consists of twelve members separated into two subgroups, EXO-K and EXO-M, performing music in Korean and Mandarin, respectively. EXO rose to fame with the release of their best-selling first album XOXO (2013), which contained the breakthrough hit ""으르렁 (Growl)"". XOXO was a critical and commercial success, winning both Disk Daesang at the 28th Golden Disk Awards and Album of the Year at the 15th Mnet Asian Music Awards. It eventually went to sell over one million copies, putting EXO as the fastest-selling Korean artist in twelve years. Their EP Overdose (2014) made EXO the highest-charting Korean male act on the Billboard 200.

2. The polish underground rapper is known for his relaxing, jazzy style and humorous lyrics. ""Exotyka"" is his  second album released on 16 Wersow an independent, warsaw-based label. First one was called ""Masaz Glowy"".

3. The modern rock band from Chicago, USA was formed in the late 90s, and toured with several notable acts (including Trapt) before disbanding in 2006 at the death of one of the members.

4. The french-speaking christian band, founded in 1989 when the South-African Chris Christensen and his American wife Laura met the Swiss Thierry Ostrini. They have written several worship songs sung in french-speaking churches. Their first album (recorded in Brussels) was released in 1995. A specific profile has been created at EXO Groupe. Please update your music library tags.

5. A Russian Metal Band from Saint-Petersburg 

6. Helsinki based three-piece EXO play a hybrid of riff based doom, post hardcore and pseudoscientific space rock, the last being a non-audible element. EXO strips off all of rock music's unnecessary elements, thus displaying the steady foundation of bass and drums. Their trademark sound is economic yet massive.

7. Behind the codename EXo (mind the capital X) we find Gheorghi Penkov -a person known for his numerous activities, both in art and science. 27 years old, he already has a definite musical experience -as a DJ, producer, promoter, music journalist and beatbox/darbuka performer. Jorro, as his friends call him, is open to every genre as long as it brings experiment and new ideas. EXo’s interest in music production and mixing dates back to 1995 when he initially got interested in interactive multimedia demos. Together with friend Martin Hristov, Gheorghi starts the demo group Ancient Media, that in consequently released the two demos – Idleness (’96) and Water Illusions (‘97). Demos are highly technological short video productions (10 mins) that render audio and video in realtime. This early interest in multimedia triggers EXo’s passion for electronic music. Between 19982001 he produces ambient and downtemp tracks under the SentagriS moniker. Unfortunately most of these never get released, since in 90s there is no label or company interested in such sound in Bulgaria,... net-labels are yet to come. Years later, two of these tracks are included in the digital releases Wamoxyn (2003, Z-dimension) and Acnod Tucmod Tipo (2007, Contone Records). With his typical perfectionism and endless energy, EXo continues his search for new sound experimenting with electronics, beat-boxing and darbuka/djembe drums. Soon after he finds the drum and bass that and it takes over his focus. EXo joins H.M.S.U. by appointment with Dimitar “Targy” Dimitrov, and is with the organization since it’s very first days. By that time he's a junior drum and bass DJ, one that in the course of time gets totally devoted to the classic drum and bass (it's what we nowadays call oldskool). After H.M.S.U’s third openair festival EXo’s focus starts to slowly shift towards jungle, and eventually dub music. During his sporadic 2003-2005 appearances on H.M.S.U. events he selects mostly roots and tech dub. Then suddenly, in 2005, he finds a new sound that fundamentally changes his view on bass music, and puts his musical roaming to an end. In 2006, EXo becomes the first DJ to pioneer the fresh dubstep genre in Bulgaria -the audience is schoked, yet fascinated by the unexpected beat. But that’s enough of a reason  for dubstep to become EXo’s primary focus in the years to come. Consequently he proves himself as the leading dubstep DJ in the country – always with up to date selection of uncompromised sound quality. Up to date EXo has presented dubstep on more than 50 venues, and for the listening pleasure of Bulgarian, Romanian and Greek audiences. He has performed on one stage with artists like Luke Envoy and Mary Anne Hobbs /BBC Radio1/. In 2007, on two big venues, HMSU’s Summer Open-air Festival 2007 and at Drum and Jazz 2007, EXo presented his experimental live dupstep project together with popoular drummer Victor Alexandrov. Nowdays, EXo is also responsible for the logistics and coordination of number of H.M.S.U. activities. He and Martin Popov are the leading promoters for more than 50 events. Since mid 2005, EXo is involved in every single H.M.S.U. event. EXo also drives the Mirizma events – a musical platform for experimental and downtemp performances.

8. Ukrainian group EXO is made by ex-members of Skryabin band Rostislav ""Roy"" Domishevsky and Sergij ""Shura"" Gera (also member of ""Dazzle Dreams"" and ""Druga Rika""). By this time they have made only one album in 2004. Guyz are following the style of old Skryabin.

125,fleet foxes,2288141,103383555,"Fleet Foxes is an American indie folk band formed in Seattle, Washington in 2006. The band consists of Robin Pecknold (vocals, guitar), Skyler Skjelset (guitar, mandolin, backing vocals), Casey Wescott (keyboards, mandolin, backing vocals), Christian Wargo (bass, guitar, backing vocals) and Morgan Henderson (upright bass, guitar, woodwinds, violin, percussion, saxophone).

Led by singer-songwriter Robin Pecknold, the band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP Sun Giant and their debut album Fleet Foxes on Sub Pop. Both received critical praise and reviewers often noted the band's use of refined lyrics and vocal harmonies. Fleet Foxes' second studio album Helplessness Blues was released on Sub Pop in 2011. Following a hiatus between 2013 and 2016, during which Pecknold pursued an undergraduate degree, Fleet Foxes reunited to record their third album, Crack-Up, released on Nonesuch Records in 2017. The band's fourth album, Shore, was released on Anti- in September 2020.

Formation and early years (2005–06)
Robin Pecknold and Skyler Skjelset both attended Lake Washington High School in Kirkland, a suburb of Seattle, and soon became close friends. Pecknold and Skjelset bonded over an appreciation of Bob Dylan and Neil Young and began making music together. Their parents influenced their musical tastes early on—Skjelset's mother Peggi was a keen listener to both Dylan and Hank Williams while Pecknold's father Greg was a member of The Fathoms, a local 1960s soul group. The two shared an interest in the music of Dylan and Brian Wilson. Pecknold played bass for Seattle's Dolour on a US tour in 2005, shortly before forming the first incarnation of Fleet Foxes.

Originally going by the name ""The Pineapples"", a name clash with another local band prompted a change and Pecknold decided upon ""Fleet Foxes"", suggesting that it was ""evocative of some weird English activity like fox hunting"". Pecknold took up the role of principal songwriter, both singing and playing guitar, while Skjelset played lead guitar. The original lineup was filled out by Casey Wescott on keyboards and backing vocals, Bryn Lumsden on bass and Nicholas Peterson on drums and backing vocals.

Pecknold's late-sixties pop style caught the attention of the Seattle producer Phil Ek and he helped them record their first demo in 2006, the self-released Fleet Foxes EP. Ek was impressed with the band's songwriting, and on hearing Pecknold for the first time, noted, ""It was obvious he had talent coming out of his ass."" By late 2006 the Seattle press began to take notice of the band; Tom Scanlon of the Seattle Times stated that he was impressed with the band's lyrics and musical maturity. By the end of the year, Lumsden had been replaced on bass by Craig Curran, who would also handle many of the band's vocal harmonies.

With growing popularity on the local circuit, the band set about making their first album in early 2007, spending time in the studio with producer Ek in addition to recording material at home. However, funds for recording were tight, so the band members cobbled together what funds they had, which limited the time they had in the studio, and so the majority of the tracks were recorded in various band members' apartments, other spaces, or the basement of Pecknold's parents' house.

Sun Giant and Fleet Foxes (2007–08)
Fleet Foxes were becoming increasingly popular and by late 2007, they had attracted over a quarter of a million song plays over two months on their Myspace site. Although the band had not released any of their recordings, they benefited from word of mouth exposure and their success soon translated into a record deal, signing with Warner Music subsidiary record label Sub Pop on January 18, 2008. According to Sub Pop's A&R, Sue Busch, at the time of signing the band was still a relatively primitive set-up, being without manager or legal representation. Robin's sister Aja Pecknold then assumed the role of band manager. The band's frontman, Robin Pecknold, attributes much of their success and popularity to illegal file sharing.

The band tracked their second EP, Sun Giant, at Bear Creek Studio and performed overdubs and mixed at Seattle's Avast! Recording Co., around the same time in preparation for upcoming tours. Fleet Foxes began their spring tour with another Northwest band Blitzen Trapper on February 28, 2008. Before the recording of the EP, bassist Curran was replaced by Christian Wargo, whose voice, like that of his predecessor, would become an important part of the band's harmony blend. The band's performances, first at the SXSW festival in March 2008, and then the Sasquatch! festival in May 2008, moved the band into the public consciousness, notably attracting attention from the European press for the first time.

Sun Giant was released internationally on April 8, 2008 and the group's brand of folk, rock and pop, marked by their use of vocal harmonies, was well received by the press. Despite the warm critical reception, the group said that the EP did not represent their full ambitions, serving merely as a CD to sell while on tour. In May 2008, the band chose to extend their North American and European tour until September in support of their forthcoming album. At this time Josh Tillman replaced Peterson on drums and backing vocals. Their first full-length album, Fleet Foxes, was released shortly afterwards on June 3, 2008. The album achieved similar critical success as the previous EP. Fleet Foxes received four out of five stars from Rolling Stone, which compared it to the likes of the Beach Boys, Animal Collective, and Crosby, Stills & Nash, and a 9.0 out of 10 in a review by Pitchfork Media, sharing the website's album of the year rank with the Sun Giant EP. The Guardian was particularly complimentary, awarding the album five stars and declaring it ""a landmark in American music — an instant classic"". On June 24, 2008, Fleet Foxes went to No. 1 on the CMJ Radio 200 Chart. The album achieved an average rating of 87/100 from 30 critic reviews on the aggregator website Metacritic.

While the group enjoyed moderate success in the United States, Fleet Foxes was better received in Europe, selling over 200,000 copies in the five months following its release. The sales were matched with critical plaudits and their debut album won Uncut's first ever Music Award 2008 prize. Uncut's editor, Allan Jones, said the album ""showed impeccable musicianship, and although you could trace its antecedents, it sounded totally unique. Fleet Foxes was just a glorious debut."" The band sold out music venues for their tours of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, reaffirming their growing popularity.

At the end of 2008, Fleet Foxes was rated album of the year by Billboard's Critic's Choice and in Metacritic's end of year best album round-up it appeared in 17 lists, topping six of them. Furthermore, it had sold over 408,000 copies in North America and over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom, making it the first gold certificate record for UK label Bella Union. Their growing profile enabled the band to make televised appearances, playing on Vincent Moon's La Blogotheque in December 2008 and on Saturday Night Live the following January. In 2009, they toured in Europe to favorable reviews; the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said their show in Paradiso induced goosebumps. In 2008 and 2009, the band played globally ending the tour in September with a final European leg.

Helplessness Blues (2009–12)
Pecknold said that he would have liked the album to be released in 2009; however, the band's touring schedule delayed rehearsals of the new songs until February 2009. These sessions took place in a rented house outside Seattle, but were mostly scrapped, losing the band $60,000 of their own money. Further delays ensued because the drummer, Tillman, was scheduled to play a solo tour in Europe and North America throughout the 2009–10 winter. Pecknold later sent some demos to producer Phil Ek and expressed the hope that the second LP would emerge in late 2010.

In December 2009, Pecknold said he wanted the new LP to sound ""less poppy, less upbeat and more groove-based"". He referenced the 12-string guitar sound from Roy Harper's folk album Stormcock, saying, ""That will be the primary sonic distancing from the last record."" He wanted the band to record very quickly, with ""vocal takes in one go, so even if there are fuck-ups, I want them to be on there. I want there to be guitar mistakes. I want there to be not totally flawless vocals. I want to record it and have that kind of cohesive sound. Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, to me, is the best-sounding album because it sounds like there were only six hours in the universe for that album to be recorded in. So I want it to have that feeling."" The band eventually began recording in April 2010 in various locations (including West Hurley, New York) under the label Reciprocal Recording and decided to scrap the earlier idea of a fast recording (though according to the band many of the initial vocals were done in one take). The album features a new six-piece band line up, with the addition of the former Blood Brothers bassist Morgan Henderson on upright bass and woodwind instruments.

The album, Helplessness Blues, was released on May 3, 2011 with a cover illustrated by the Seattle artist Toby Liebowitz and painted by Christopher Alderson. The title track was released via free download on January 31, 2011, and the album's fourth track, ""Battery Kinzie"", was premiered in the UK on Zane Lowe's radio show on March 22, 2011. The Sub Pop record label released a downloadable music video of the track ""Grown Ocean"", with footage of the album's recording, on its website in support of the album. A 12"" vinyl double A-side single of ""Helplessness Blues"" and ""Grown Ocean"" was released for Record Store Day on April 16, 2011. On November 1, 2011, Pecknold's brother, Sean Pecknold, released the official music video for ""The Shrine / An Argument"".

Helplessness Blues was nominated as Best Folk Album at the 2012 Grammy Awards, held February 12, 2012.

Departure of Tillman and hiatus (2012–2016)
On January 18, 2012, after the band had finished touring for the album, drummer Tillman announced that he had left the band. He would go on to reinvent himself and record several albums as Father John Misty, notable for his ironic sense of humor in lyrics and media as well as often criticizing both the record industry and society in interviews and on stage.

In October 2020, Pecknold reflected on Tillman's departure during a Reddit AMA: ""[Josh] ""quit"" the band after recording drums for Helplessness, got into narcotics and made his first Father John Misty album while I was making Helplessness in Seattle. Then Sub Pop offered to put out his album, but only if he delayed it for a year or so and toured Helplessness with us. Which we all weakly agreed to going through with, but it quickly became obvious he'd rather have just been doing that project instead, and I would have rathered that as well. So that tour I had to endure being around a lot of substance abuse, sabotaged shows, just general ill treatment, shit-talking, all while paying him for songs he didn't have anything to do with. It sucked!""

On June 15, 2013, an image of a home recording set-up–including a laptop computer, microphone and guitar–was posted on the Fleet Foxes Facebook page with the caption ""Step one"". On June 16, 2013, an image of a broken mandolin with the caption ""Step two"" was posted. These images were later deleted, but led to speculation that the group was working on a new project, possibly a third studio album. On April 23, 2014, Robin Pecknold posted to the band's Facebook page that he had moved to New York to get his undergraduate degree at the Columbia University School of General Studies, a liberal arts college of Columbia University in New York City.

Crack-Up (2016–2018)
On May 18, 2016, while answering fan questions on his Instagram account, Pecknold confirmed that Fleet Foxes were working on new material with drummer and frequent collaborator Neal Morgan, best known for his work with Joanna Newsom and Bill Callahan. Describing Morgan as a ""full Fox"", Pecknold also admitted he ""had to up my songwriting game for homeboy."" However, when Pecknold posted a photo of the band minus Morgan on Instagram, he clarified that Morgan was one of three drummers involved in the new album, and that for the time being Fleet Foxes would consist of Pecknold, Skjelset, Wescott, Wargo, and Henderson as a ""five-piece 'core band'"", but they would still use a drummer for live performances and additional musicians for certain shows. Pecknold also said that the new material would be ""a different vibe"" compared to Fleet Foxes' previous output. On November 14, 2016, the band confirmed (via their Facebook account) that their new album was nearly complete.

On December 25, 2016, Pecknold posted a photo on his Instagram account which showed four albums in the Fleet Foxes' queue in his iTunes library: the first studio album Fleet Foxes; the Sun Giant EP; the second studio album Helplessness Blues; and an unknown third album entitled Ylajali. This led to speculation that the band's third album would: 1) be named after a character from Knut Hamsun's novel Hunger; 2) contain a photo from Japanese photographer Hiroshi Hamaya as the cover art; and 3) be released through Nonesuch Records, since the label's logo can be seen on the album cover.

In an email newsletter on January 1, 2017, production company Mason Jar Music confirmed that Fleet Foxes was working on a new album, since they contributed to the production. The album was called Crack-Up, after an F. Scott Fitzgerald essay of the same name. The album is a concept album and was recorded at Electric Lady Studios and Sear Sound in New York City.

On March 7, 2017, Fleet Foxes announced their third studio album, Crack-Up, released on June 16, 2017 via Nonesuch Records, a new label for the band. The lead single, ""Third of May / Ōdaigahara"", was released the same day. On April 4, 2017, the band posted the album trailer for the new album on YouTube. The trailer briefly presents various songs from the album and shows some images while they were recording them. The video was made by Sean Pecknold, Robin's brother.

On May 15, 2017, Fleet Foxes made their live return at the Wilma Theatre in Missoula, in which they performed nine songs from Crack-Up along with a selection of older material and a cover of ""In the Morning"" by Bee Gees. The band's current live line-up includes Matt Barrick of The Walkmen, who is also the most heavily featured of the three guest drummers who contributed to Crack-Up. Barrick has continued to play with the band, but has not become an official member. The new album also included the sounds of a brass quartet called The Westerlies.

On October 10, 2017, the band announced the release of a new EP, entitled The Electric Lady Session, for Black Friday Record Store Day 2017. The EP was released on November 24 of that year, and is a collection of live performances of four songs from Crack-Up, originally recorded for their session at Fordham University’s radio station WFUV. For Record Store Day 2018, the band released another EP, entitled ""Crack Up (Choral Version)""/""In The Morning (Live in Switzerland)"", in collaboration with the Icelandic female choir, Graduale Nobili.

Born in Prishtina, Kosovo in 1990, Ora's family moved to London where she was raised. According to the Hot Right Now Songfacts, during her early teens Ora attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School, whose other notable alumni include Emma Bunton and Amy Winehouse. 

Her first UK exposure came after several collaborations with British singer Craig David. In 2009, she also auditioned for BBC talent competition 'Your Country Needs You' – to select the United Kingdom's entrant for the Eurovision Song Contest – but withdrew her application.

In 2009, she signed a recording contract with Jay-Z's label Roc Nation and relocated to America. The How We Do (Party) Songfacts reports that when Ora visited Clear Channel with Jay-Z to present music and videos from her debut release, the executives were so enthused by what they heard that they organised for How We Do (Party)  to be immediately premiered on DJ JJ's afternoon show on New York's top hit music station WHTZ (Z100). Her debut album ORA was released on 26th August, 2012.

In December 2015, Ora filed a lawsuit against Roc Nation, seeking release from the label and citing that the contract she signed in 2008 is ""unenforceable"", due to California's ""seven-year rule."" The complaint stated that she's ""only been permitted to release one album despite creating multiple additional records for release"" and that her relationship with Roc Nation is ""irrevocably damaged."" Her complaint also pointed out a breach of contract, reporting that Roc Nation breached the recording agreement by improperly taking twenty percent commission of her income. In January 2016, Roc Nation filed a counter-lawsuit against Ora for breaking her recording contract. They reached a settlement in May 2016. In June 2016, it was reported that she signed a new record deal with Atlantic Records and Warner Music Group.

The lead single, ""Your Song"", reached the UK top ten; and the subsequent singles, ""Anywhere"" and ""Let You Love Me"", reached the top five in the UK.

Recientemente ya llegaron a presentarse en Mexico especialmente en Monterrey donde realizaron bailes masivos logrando en el auditorio coca cola un lleno impresionante de alrrededor de 20,000 personas y en el lugar de origen de la cumbia, Colombia, siendo el primer grupo argentino del genero de cumbia villera en trascender tanto internacionalmente.

La banda fue creada por Pablo Lescano. Anteriormente Pablo había integrado la prestigiosa banda Amar Azul en calidad de teclista. También fue el creador, el compositor y el alma del primer grupo de ""cumbia villera"" de Argentina Flor de Piedra, aunque no participó como músico en ella. Quién si lo hizo fue Romina Lescano, su hermana, que luego lo acompañó en Damas Gratis.

El estilo que empezó a asomar con Flor de Piedra alcanzó el máximo de profesionalismo con Damas Gratis. Hizo explosión y se consolidó en un indiscutible éxito relegando decenas de imitaciones a rol secundario.

Damas Gratis, sin letras románticas, melodías melosas ni carilindos colocó nuevamente a nuestra música tropical en los más variados sectores sociales, logro alcanzado por muy pocos grupos en la historia de la movida tropical.

La música y el ritmo de Damas Gratis continuó avanzando hasta trascender los límites de la música tropical, así lo reflejan diversos artículos publicados en diarios líderes en sus respectivos países como ser: Clarín, La Nación, El País, Buenos Aires Herald y revistas como Noticias o Rolling Stone, que también se ocuparon de este fenómeno que revolucionó la movida tropical y a la vez ubicó en los canales de televisión un rico debate alrededor de la cultura de las villas.


 Música de películas  [editar]Las melodías de Pablo Lescano siguen rompiendo fronteras culturales, ya que el filme del argentino Pablo Trapero ""El Bonaerense"", llegó a Francia al ""Festival de Cine de Cannes"" y su banda de sonido es de Pablo Lescano con ""Damas Gratis"".

He found his passion for both singing and dancing at the age of 9 with influences from The Jackson's: An American Dream and The Temptations movies; imitating no less than the greatest. Jacquees participated in his first talent show in fifth grade at Canby Lane Elementary School performing the Jackson 5's, ""I Want You Back,"" winning 1st place.

In 2007, Jacquees was introduced to his manager, Orlando Grind, by Dexx Lee. After years of performing in local talent shows, Orlando soon introduced him to Russell ""Block"" Spencer, founder and CEO of Block Entertainment. When Jacquees started going to the studio he merely blended with the team and wasn't given the opportunity to express his true talents. ""When you see work being done around you but not for you, you tend to get discouraged,"" says Jacquees. At that time, Block's focus was only rap, not R&B. It wasn't until summer of 2009 when Block witnessed how talented Jacquees was and shifted his vision. Jacquees began to work closely with Block Entertainment recording and gaining more exposure with the release of his first single ""Krazy"" featuring Grand Hustle's own, T.I. 

Jacquees has recorded with label mates, Gorilla Zoe and Scotty, T.I.P, and an upcoming Atlanta rapper, J-Real. Jacquees dreams to work with established artist Lil Wayne, Drake, Justin Bieber, Bow Wow, Lil' Chuckee, Chris Brown, and many more. ""All of these artists started out at the age I am and are successful in the industry. I look up to them and dream that I will be just as successful as they are,"" Jacquees explains. ""Only better!"" 

""It's truly a blessing to have the opportunity to work with the artist and producers I have already worked with,"" says Jacquees. ""I pray to God every night that I continue on this journey and achieve what I've always dreamed of doing. With God on my side, I know this is only the beginning and there is more to come."" With that in mind, Jacquees will achieve any and everything he wants out of the music industry.

148,chris lake,628535,6428874,"Globally recognised as one of the most exciting, forward thinking and cutting edge producers on the scene, Chris Lake's rare ability to create tracks that fuse elements of house, electro and techno has not been lost on his fellow peers. His innovative productions continue to receive wave after wave of support from such luminaries that include Sasha, Danny Howells, Justin Robertson, Sander Kleinenberg and Carl Cox, whilst Pete Tong leads the way in championing the unique sound that has established Chris as one of the world's elite.

An avid producer since 2001, Chris's breakthrough came in 2005. His tracks 'One Too Many' and 'Release' caught the attention of the world's press and A&R bosses, but it was the release of his smash hit 'Changes' that catapulted his name into the record boxes of DJs across the planet.

'Changes' became Radio 1's 'Essential New Tune' twice, reaching number 27 in the national charts and picking up column inches in tabloid papers and magazines; turning the once underground buzzer into a worldwide hit.

Chris's DJ schedule duly sky rocketed and over the past 2 years, he has travelled to all four corners of the globe taking in Asia, South America, USA, Australia and Africa. He has graced some of the biggest clubs on the planet that include Ministry Of Sound, Space, Warung, Spybar and Amnesia together with countless festivals - Global Gathering, Creamfields and the Extrema festival in Holland.

In 2006, Chris set up Rising Music as an outlet for his new productions. Rising swiftly became the benchmark for pure underground house - releases that included 'One Too Many', 'Fantasy' and 'Release' have set the standard, whilst Chris has also shown that his A&R head is amongst the best in the business by signing artists that include Sebastien Leger, Micky Slim and Deadmau5.

Chris's success continued in 2007 with his track 'Carry Me Away' hitting the coveted number one spot on the USA Billboard Dance Chart, thus etching his name into the dance history books and propelling his US profile into the stratosphere.

Further collaborations in 2007 with Deadmau5 on 'I thought inside out' and Sebastien Leger 'Word/Ghost' once again proved Chris's versatility in the studio, and with both productions hitting the Beatport Top spot, Chris continued to cement his status as one of the world's finest producers.

And of course there is the small matter of Chris remixing some of the biggest names in the music scene. Robbie Williams, Kylie Minogue, Mark Ronson, Lily Allen, Deadmau5 and the Rogue Traders are amongst some of the names to have received sublime workouts from Chris, and support has been immense; not only from Radio 1, but every major radio station around the world.

Radio 1 has also allowed Chris to show his unrivalled ability in the art of DJ'ing. His Essential Mix in August 2007 was yet another defining step in his career as he unveiled two hours of sublime techno, electro and tech house to keep a worldwide audience of millions captivated. His mix was voted as one of the best since the inception of the Essential Mix series, and reminded everyone why Chris is at the top of his trade.

2008 has seen Chris's profile grow even bigger with his global DJ tours, top quality releases, and an eye for the new media world via his new Podcast series - the latter of which has made i-Tunes' 'new and notable' for the last three months. Meanwhile his stunning track 'Only One' taken from his One E.P has held its place in Beatport's Top 5 for more than two weeks, and is currently climbing the US and Australian dance charts faster than ever.

His latest track doing the rounds is 'If you knew', a track Pete Tong reckons is ""sounding like a cross between 'Changes' and the song 'Pjanoo' never had - conventional but huge... and we haven't had a song like this for a while.""

Chris shows no signs of slowing down, and with demand for his sound even higher than ever, you can be sure to see his name up in lights for many years to come.

She is known for her blend of indie pop, dream pop, and electronic music. She grew up in a creatively and musically supportive environment; her mother, Kärsti Stiege, was a photographer and former member of the band Tant Strul, while her father, Johan Zachrisson, was a musician in the Swedish reggae/progg band Dag Vag. Her brother, Zacharias Zachrisson, also pursued a music career. The family moved frequently, living in Stockholm, Portugal, Nepal, and India, which exposed her to a variety of cultural and musical influences from a young age. These experiences would later inform her music style and creative outlook.

At 19, Lykke Li spent several months in Brooklyn, New York, immersing herself in the local music scene before returning to Sweden. She went back to Brooklyn two years later at age 21 to record her debut album, Youth Novels, which was released in Sweden on January 30, 2008. Produced by Björn Yttling of the band Peter Bjorn and John along with Lasse Mårtén, Youth Novels gained international acclaim for its confessional lyrics and minimalistic production. It was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland in June 2008 and in the United States on August 19. Her single ""Little Bit"" from the album captured widespread attention, gaining praise from the indie community and the music site Stereogum, which described her style as a blend of soul, electro, and “powdered-sugar pop.”

Building on the success of her debut, Lykke Li continued to release music that explored themes of love, heartache, and introspection. Her follow-up albums, Wounded Rhymes in 2011 and I Never Learn in 2014, showcased a more mature, emotionally charged sound, with Wounded Rhymes earning her two Swedish Grammy Awards for Artist of the Year and Album of the Year in 2012. Alongside her solo career, she collaborated with prominent artists like Kleerup and Röyksopp, lending her vocals to the tracks ""Until We Bleed,"" ""Miss It So Much,"" and ""Were You Ever Wanted."" Her growing popularity led to notable appearances on shows like Conan and Skavlan in early 2011, helping her reach an even broader audience.

In 2016, Lykke Li co-founded the band LIV alongside members of Miike Snow and Peter Bjorn and John, further expanding her creative pursuits. Two years later, she released her fourth album, So Sad So Sexy (2018), marking a shift towards a more mainstream pop sound infused with late-2010s production influences. Her 2022 album, Eyeye, saw her return to a more introspective and sonically experimental approach, once again showcasing her characteristic blend of melancholic lyrics and innovative production. Over her career, Lykke Li has built a reputation for her sensuous, ethereal vocals and innovative musical style, solidifying her place as a significant figure in contemporary indie pop and electronic music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lykke+Li"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band’s last full-length release, Destroying the World to Save It, attained number 21 on the Native DJ World Charts for best album of 2005. 
  
IKON has frequently toured Australia, Europe and the UK. IKON has played on the same bill as The Sisters of Mercy, H.I.M., Soft Cell, Death in June, London After Midnight and The Mission. IKON has performed at the Eurorock Festival (2001) in Belgium and at the M’era Luna Festival (2002) in Hildesheim, Germany before an audience of more than 15,000 people. The band has also appeared three times at the world’s largest goth festival, Wave Gotik Treffen in Leipzig, Germany, in 2003, 2005 (during that year Anthony Cornish joined the live line-up on guitar) and 2011. 

In 2007, the band embarked upon ‘The Burden of History’ tour of Europe to mark the release of the singles collection (1992-2007) of the same name. The  EPs League of Nations (2007) and Amongst the Runes (2008) demonstrate a progression in IKON’s signature sound, providing a taster of the forthcoming album Love, Hate and Sorrow (to be released in September 2009). While retaining the essence of influences such as Joy Division, early New Order and Death in June, the future for IKON promises to add further texture to the band’s style. Love, Hate and Sorrow embraces more melodic song structures without entirely relinquishing the shadowy threads that are interweaved in the lyrics, art work, and music of one of the world’s most successful and enduring darkwave bands. The single ""A Line on a Dark Day"" from the album will also be made into the band's first video clip.

2) A UK collaborative project of Elliot Ireland and Alex Rizzo, the people behind the Jalapeno label. They utilise a wide range of guest vocalists and instrumentalists to create an interesting fusion of dnb, jazz, downtempo and triphop. They have released a self-titled album and at least 2 singles, 'The Dove' and 'Tricolour'. The album took a long time to make and was created in 7 different countries with 8 different collaborations, in languages such as Portuguese and English.

From the Jalapeno Records Website on Ikon:
""As for the Ikon sound it's tricky to categorise: bossa nova melodies seem to seep effortlessly into epic cinematic productions, which mutate into slick drum and bass rhythms.""
""Musically the group cites most genres as being influential to the Ikon sound, particularly jazz, funk, soul and hip hop.""
""What the hell is Ikon about? ""Happy coincidences,"" opines co-founding member Alex Rizzo with a smile."" 
""Ikon is about producing lush, imaginative music and recreating sounds in an original way. Give us a keyboard a string, synth or computer- Rolf Harris's stylophone and we'll play it- the quirkier the better. If there's a sound we wanna emulate we'll try and get the original materials: like a 60s bass and a 60s mic to get the right effect.""

Dinos naît le 30 novembre 1993 à Douala, au Cameroun, et arrive en France à l'âge de 4 ans avec sa famille où ils s'installent dans la cité des 4000 à La Courneuve, en Seine-Saint-Denis. Il sort son premier projet, Thumbs Up, en 2011, puis commence à se faire un nom dans les Rap Contenders, où deux MCs s'affrontent a capella.

En mai 2013, Dinos signe sur le label Def Jam France et, le 3 juin 2013, sort un EP intitulé L'alchimiste en référence au livre du même nom de Paulo Coelho.

Courant 2014, Dinos quitte Def Jam France pour Capitol Music France et sort, le 14 avril 2014, un second EP intitulé Apparences, porté par le titre Namek; lequel rencontre un certain succès.

Après une longue période d'absence sur le devant de la scène il annonce son premier album Imany qu'il ne sortira que 2 ans après. Entre l'annonce de cet album et la sortie de celui-ci, il sort Pas Imany mais presque en 2016. Dinos marque son retour le 8 décembre 2017 avec le titre Flashé. Le 30 mars 2018, il dévoile le single Les pleurs du mal. Le 27 avril 2018, Dinos sort Imany, son premier album studio. Malgré un succès critique quasi-unanime, l'album ne fait que 3.131 ventes lors de sa première semaine d'exploitation. Il faut cependant préciser que cet album est très personnel et ne comporte aucun son destiné à être un succès commercial Le 20 août 2018, il participe à Colors, émission musicale allemande très populaire sur YouTube, et livre une prestation live de son titre Argentique. Il participe au projet 93 Empire produit par Affranchis Music (Sofiane), ou il est présent sur 2 titres (Drive By feat Sadek et Ixzo et Viens dans mon 93 feat Sofiane et Hornet La Frappe). Le 7 décembre 2018, l'artiste sort une édition « Deluxe » et qui comprend 7 titres inédits, dont Placebo, qui aura un grand succès sur les plateformes de streaming.

Un an et demi après Imany, le 4 octobre 2019, Dinos sort le titre XNXX, premier extrait de son album Taciturne, qui sort le 29 novembre de la même année. Viennent ensuite les titres Mack le Bizz Freestyle et Oskur, tous deux clippés. Avec Taciturne, Dinos écoule 7815 exemplaires en 1 semaine d'exploitation. Un score honorable d'autant plus que Dinos a sorti son album le même jour que Gradur et SCH, deux rappeurs habitués aux grands succès commerciaux. cela ne l’empêchera pas d'avoir son premier disque d'or plusieurs semaines avant la sortie de son dernier album Stamina,

Le 27 novembre 2020, il publie Stamina, son troisième album. Alors que l'album a réservé son lot de surprises, notamment la présence de featurings cachés, il a aussi rencontré un franc succès, que ce soit critique mais aussi commercial. Et pour preuve, selon les chiffres de ventes annoncés par Ventes Rap, ce troisième album de Dinos s'est écoulé à 23 236 équivalent ventes en première semaine.

174,katy perry,6129368,329698808,"Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson, known professionally as Katy Perry (born October 25, 1984 in Santa Barbara, CA) is an American singer, songwriter, and television judge. The story of who was born into a totally Christian environment and who years later would become a pop music star. Muse of those who feel different or excluded, Katy Perry got her first guitar (from the church) at the age of thirteen and dreamed of it, as many young people do. The difference is that she did it. She broke free from the shackles of faith (without ever losing it) and set out to live through songs about her experiences. The result? Aside from Michael Jackson, only she was able to place five songs from the same album at the top of the charts.

 After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name 'Katy Perry' and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.

Perry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, One of the Boys, a pop rock record containing the controversial U.S number one song ""I Kissed a Girl"" and ""Hot n Cold"". Three subsequent albums have topped the U.S. Billboard 200. The disco-influenced Teenage Dream (2010) spawned five chart-topping U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles–""California Gurls"", ""Teenage Dream"", ""Firework"", ""E.T."", and ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"" — a record tying her with Michael Jackson's ""Bad"". Its follow-up record Prism (2013) was inspired by her divorce, and incorporates pop and dance along with themes of self-reflection, everyday life, and relationships. With the music videos for its chart-topping songs ""Roar"" and ""Dark Horse"", Perry became the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on Vevo.  Her 2017 electropop album,  'Witness' featured a political subtext and a theme of liberation. Her sixth studio album 'Smile' followed in 2020.

Perry has nine U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one singles and has received various awards, including four Guinness World Records, five Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award. She has been included in the annual Forbes lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011 to 2019. Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. Perry is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 18 million albums and 125 million singles worldwide. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled ""Katy Perry: Part of Me"" in 2012, and voiced Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs and its sequel in 2013. Her Super Bowl halftime show performance is the most watched in history. Perry also began serving as a judge on American Idol in 2018. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

180,red velvet,1113117,196622717,"There are three artists who go by Red Velvet:
1) k-pop
2) Italian musician
3) future funk

1) Red Velvet (레드벨벳) is a five-member South Korean girl group formed by SM Entertainment in 2014. The group consists of Irene (아이린), Seulgi (슬기), Wendy (웬디), Joy (조이), and Yeri (예리). Their name is a play on their dual concept of ""red"" and ""velvet;"" the ""red"" half is their brighter and bubblier side, while their ""velvet"" image is their softer, more mature and elegant concept.

Debuting in 2014, Red Velvet was originally a four-member group. Three of the original four members of Red Velvet were previously part of S.M. Entertainment's pre-debut team, SM Rookies. Seulgi, the first member who joined the agency, was brought in through an audition in 2007. Irene, the next member to join the company, was cast in 2009. Joy, the member who wasn't part of SM Rookies, auditioned through the SM Global Audition in Seoul in 2012. As part of SM Rookies, several clips of Irene and Seulgi were released on S.M. Entertainment's official YouTube account. The three members were rumored to debut as a group in July 2014, which was then later confirmed by SM Entertainment. With the addition of member Joy, the four-member group would debut as Red Velvet - SM Entertainment's first girl group in five years, after f(x).

Red Velvet's debut single ""행복 (Happiness)"" was digitally released on August 4, 2014. The music video was released on August 1, and later become the second most viewed K-pop video worldwide in August 2014; on the same day, the group made their official debut stage on the music program Music Bank.

Red Velvet released their second digital single ""Be Natural"" on October 13, 2014. It is a remake of a song by veteran SM Entertainment girl group, S.E.S.. The track features Taeyong, former member of SM Rookies' male unit named SR14B, as well as a member of NCT. The group started their promotional activities for this release on October 9, making their first appearance on the music program, M! Countdown. The music video for the song was released on the same day.

On March 11, 2015, SM Entertainment released a video announcing the addition of a new member to the group's lineup—Yeri. On March 14, ""Automatic,"" the group's first music video featuring Yeri, was released. The following day, they released their first mini-album ""Ice Cream Cake"", along with the music video for ""Ice Cream Cake."" It was also announced by S.M. Entertainment that both ""Automatic"" and ""Ice Cream Cake"" would be promoted as double lead singles of the album. 

In early September 2015, S.M. Entertainment announced that the group would be making a comeback, and on September 9, 2015, Red Velvet released their first full length album ""The Red"". The album features ten tracks, including the title track, ""Dumb Dumb."" The album focuses on their ""red"" image, which is supposed to be the group's bright and bold side. On December 18, 2015, the group took part in S.M. Entertainment's special winter project, Winter Garden, alongside label-mates f(x) and BoA, releasing a digital single titled ""세가지 소원 (Wish Tree).""

While promoting ""The Red"", it was hinted at by the members and S.M. Entertainment that there would be a follow up album, but nothing was confirmed at that time. In March 2016, it was announced that the group would make a comeback with the group's second mini album. ""The Velvet"" was released on March 17, 2016 as a direct follow up to their first album ""The Red"". While ""The Red' focuses on the ""red"" half of the group's image, ""The Velvet' focuses on the group's smooth and soft ""velvet"" image. The title track, ""7월 7일 (One Of These Nights),"" is described as an R&B ballad. On March 27, 2016, the group performed the track on music show Inkigayo.

On September 7, 2016, Red Velvet released their third mini-album ""Russian Roulette"". The mini album features seven tracks, including the title track of the same name, ""러시안 룰렛 (Russian Roulette)"". On September 13, 2016, Red Velvet took their first music show win for ""Russian Roulette"" on The Show. The title track peaked at #2 on the Gaon Digital Chart and Billboard's World Digital Songs chart, making it their highest rankings on both charts at the time. On January 27, 2018, the music video for ""Russian Roulette"" became the group's first music video to reach 100 million views.

 A few months later in January of 2017, it was announced that the group would be releasing new music in February. The group's fourth mini-album ""Rookie"" was released on February 1, 2017. The mini-album contains six tracks, including the title track of the same name, ""Rookie"" and ""마지막 사랑 (Last Love),"" a solo track by group member Wendy. 

On July 9, 2017, Red Velvet released their fifth mini-album ""The Red Summer"". The mini-album features five tracks, including lead track ""Red Flavor."" The album was a commercial success, becoming their third #1 win, which made them the K-pop girl group with the most #1 albums on a chart. All five tracks on the mini album debuted in the Top 50 of the Gaon Digital Chart.

Red Velvet revisited their ""velvet"" image by releasing their second full-length album ""Perfect Velvet"" on November 17, 2017 with the lead single ""Peek-a-Boo."" ""Peek-a-Boo"" peaked at #2 on Billboard's World Digital Songs chart. In South Korea, the album and the single ""Peek-a-Boo"" both charted at #2 on the Gaon Album Chart and Gaon Digital Chart. Through the release of Rookie, The Red Summer and Perfect Velvet all in the same year and the success of their albums overseas, Red Velvet achieved a ""top girl group"" status in South Korea in 2017. On January 29, 2018, Red Velvet released a repackage of their previous album titled ""The Perfect Red Velvet"", consisting of three new songs, including title track ""Bad Boy."" This was meant to be the most ""velvet"" track Red Velvet had ever put out.

On March 20, 2018, it was announced that Red Velvet would be performing alongside other selected South Korean artists for an inter-Korean concert in Pyongyang, North Korea.

The extended play debuted at #3 on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart and sold 26,124 copies on its first week of release in Japan.

On July 19, 2018, Red Velvet announced they would be making a comeback soon and had already filmed their music video outdoors in Gyeonggi-do. Excitement was stirred after the announcement of an English language version of previous single ""Bad Boy."" The songs from the new album were performed during Red Velvet's concert Redmare.

The extended play contained seven tracks, including the title track ""Power Up"" and a bonus track of their popular song ""Bad Boy"" recorded in English.

He describes himself as “a soft-spoken but intricate lyricist with a cocky side.” His stage name originates from “jittery,” his grandmother’s nickname for him due to his sporadic behavior as a child.

He first appeared on the Atlanta hip-hop scene with his debut EP, DiCaprio, in 2015. Growing up, JID's first connection with music was through his parents' collection of classic funk and soul LPs. After a stint at Hampton University playing football, JID also hooked up with fellow MCs as part of the Spillage Village collective. By 2012, he had dropped out of college to focus on music, and in 2014 he headed out on what would be a productive tour with EarthGang, Bas, and Ab-Soul. Touring allowed JID to craft his skills, and a year later he recorded and dropped the DiCaprio EP, which saw him team up with a host of producers, as well as EarthGang. While keen to distance himself from the generic abrasive trap sound that had dominated the Atlanta scene, JID wanted to deliver something that was more than just about a beat, and instead focused his time and effort on lyrics as well.

Panzera and Tomasi continued to take a backroom role, writing the lyrics together with Cremona. The project's satirical nature and image, with a laddish frontman and two blonde bombshell singers, made it somewhat analogous to .

The early success subsequently hailed them as the New Artist of the Year at several awards shows, including Golden Disc Awards and Seoul Music Awards.

The group's Japanese debut single, ""好きと言わせたい (Suki to Iwasetai)"", was released on February 6, 2019 under UMG's EMI Records label. Peaking at number 2 on Oricon Singles Chart and with over 250,000 unit sales, the single was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ).

The group was set to release their first studio album, Album page: BLOOM*IZ, on November 11, 2019. However, the release was postponed due to the Mnet vote manipulation investigation. Investigations had revealed that all twelve members of IZ*ONE were selected before the finale of Produce 48. As a result, their showcases, promotions, and several guest appearances were cancelled or put on hold. On January 6, 2020, the members' agencies and CJ ENM reached an agreement to resume the group's activities.

Eventually, BLOOM*IZ was released on February 17, 2020. The album became the best selling girl group album in Gaon Chart history with 480,000 sales as of April 2020. The lead single ""Fiesta"" was also a great success, becoming their biggest hit to date and peaking at #3 in Korea.

On March 10, 2021, Mnet confirmed that IZ*ONE would be disbanding as planned after the expiration of their contract at the end of April of the same year. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/IZ%2AONE"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They debuted on May 2, 2018 with their first mini-album I Am, featuring the title track ""LATATA"". (G)I-DLE are known to be directly involved in the creation of their music, and have been regarded as one of the most successful South Korean girl groups that do not hail from the ""big three"" record labels.

(G)I-DLE reached significant popularity in a short timeframe, receiving their first-ever music show win on SBS MTV's The Show on May 22, 2018, twenty days after their debut. With only one mini-album and two singles, the group earned several rookie awards at major year-end music award shows, including the Asia Artist Awards, Gaon Chart Music Awards, Genie Music Awards, Golden Disc Awards, Korea Popular Music Awards and Melon Music Awards. As a result, many dubbed (G)I-DLE as the ""monster rookies"" of 2018. Their participation in the League of Legends' virtual girl group project K/DA further increased their popularity globally.

After two more Korean releases, (G)I-DLE made their debut in the Japanese market on July 31,2019. Later that year, the group participated in Mnet's Queendom, a survival show where six groups competed to have the highest charting singles. As the rookies amongst older groups, (G)I-DLE finished in 3rd place.  In early 2020, their first world tour I-Land: Who Am I was announced. Originally planned to span 32 cities around the world, the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and an online concert was held in its place on July 5. Both Miyeon and Soyeon returned to reprise their roles as Ahri and Akali for the K/DA songs  ""THE BADDEST"" and ""MORE"".

On January 11, 2021, (G)I-DLE released  I Burn, which quickly became the best-selling album under Cube Entertainment, surpassing Fiction and Fact by B2ST after 10 years with over 200,000 copies sold.

The group continued to promote, releasing ""Last Dance"" as a collaboration with the platform UNIVERSE on April 29.  

For the remainder of the year, the members focused on solo activities, with Yuqi debuting as a soloist with A Page, and Soyeon making her solo comeback with Windy. Miyeon landed MC, acting, and singing opportunities, Minnie made her debut as an actress in So Not Worth It, while Shuhua participated in the Taiwanese variety program Mr. Player.  On August 14, it was announced that Soojin would officially leave (G)I-DLE, with them to continue as a five-member group.

They made their first performance as five on January 17, 2022 during Expo 2020 in Dubai. On February 24, they announced their first full-length album I Never Die, which was released on March 14 to critical acclaim. ""TOMBOY"" became the group's first chart-topper in South Korea on both the Gaon Digital Chart, the K-pop Hot 100 as well as South Korea's Billboard, where it remained for three weeks straight, which earned the group 167 Perfect All-Kills. ""MY BAG"" additionally became the group's highest charting b-side, peaking at twenty-two on the weekly Gaon Digital Chart, thirty-four on the K-pop Hot 100, and nine on South Korea's Billboard chart. On April 27, Miyeon debuted as a soloist with  My.

At the age of 10 he began to demonstrate his talent by singing Reggae in a group called The Youngsters of Reggae. The group consisted of five singers, Bebi King, Lucho Kiss, Mega D and Sicario (Kafu Banton). Zico later on decided to call himself KAFU BANTON after a Brazilian football player named Cafu.

Kafu borrowed his last name from one of the worlds biggest Reggae artists, and his inspiration, Buju Banton. Kafu studied in I.B.J.G College where, through a family member, he met one of the greatest national Reggae singer Ernesto Brown best known as (Ness). Ness introduced the world to Spanish Reggae, and Kafu followed Ness lead, letting himself be known in all kinds of Reggae music competitions at the national level. In October 1996 he won his way to number one in a competition at a club called Patatus 2 Caribe. This gave Kafu the opportunity to record a simple song called Mad Man produced by Rodney Clark El Chombo for Spanish Oil Productions. Kafu then participated in other productions under the label Oilers Music, contributing to Tales from the Crypt 2 & 3 compilations, which captured the attention of the public.

At the time Reggae was at its greatest in Panama, and Kafu along with other known artists of this generation, joined the rebirth of One Love, a group formed by Ness and the Sensations, also featuring Calito Soul, Papachan (R.I.P.), Original Dan and Bigga Man. Two years later, in 1998, due to the labels financial problems, Kafu left Oilers Music and began to work with Proarsa, a label owned by Ramon Bustamante Pucho. Kafu was again involved in various productions with the likes of Creations, Dementes, Da Crew and Sin Censura. In 2000, after having gained valuable production and business experience, Kafu produced his first album called The Best of Me which featured such gems as Pato, Way Way, Ya Estoy Cansado, El Sistema, Good Bye, Pueden Correr. The album made Kafu popular in Panama and abroad. He toured in Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, Colombia, the United States and Spain. Kafu's purpose as a lyricist is to try and change the way many people think, especially kids.

He watched as the Youth around him chose the wrong path in life, and never received the proper guidance. Kafu felt that music that conveys a positive and empowering message, was the most effective way to reach the Youth. Kafu also shares with his fans his struggle as a youth in an impoverished part of Panama, and his rise to better life through music and sheer will and determination. In 2005 Kafu Banton took his career in his own hands but creating events in the U.S and meeting key people in the states that believed in Reggae En Español. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kafu+Banton"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

235,ben mazué,76171,1297713,"Ben Mazue was born to a French teacher and an architect. He entered the music conservatory to study piano. Throughout his childhood, he and his parents lived in Biot and moved to the capital, Paris, in the following years. As a teenager, he decided to stay and settle in Paris while his parents returned to the south of France to Biot.

In addition to his piano studies, he also took courses in medicine. At the end of his various studies, he decided to take up music at the age of 25. In love with the knowledge of rap and soul music, he started to compose and to multiply his experiences as well as his friendships.

With his friend Augustin, Ben Mazue performed for a while as a duo in the bars of the capital and then went on to form a group called La Plage for at least three years. This is how he got the taste for performing on the city's stages and did not stop touring at the first opportunity.

Ben Mazue: an artist with a successful career
Ben Mazué won the Prix de la Découverte de la Sacem at the Festival Jacques Brel de Vesoul 2006. He also won the Paris Young Talent Award in June 2008 and the FAIR in 2010. He then performed a series of shows as the opening act for Anis, Tété and Hocus Pocus. Ben Mazué has also given numerous concerts on his own, notably at the Printemps de Bourges and Francofolies festivals.

He has released several albums, including Common Ground, his first 5-track album, released in 2007. Then, at the end of 2010, he released his second album with the help of guitarists Clément Simounet, Régis Ceccarelli and Jean-Pierre Sluys. Ben Mazué has also signed a contract with Columbia Label, a subsidiary of Sony Music. His first album was released in October 2011.

He released his track Confession, from his rap albums, Addicts and Mes Monuments as a single. The third single from the album, ""C'est Léger"", is sung with singer Pauline Croze. Ben Mazué has had several tours in France. In 2020, he released Paradis, his fourth album, which recounts the summary of his life in the wake of his separation.

Indeed, it is an album that also refers to the island of Reunion, which he affectionately calls his Paradise on Earth. Finally, during the years 2020 and 2021, he becomes with his song Quand je marche, the winner of the Charles Cros prize, one of the high school students of the ACC.

What is Ben Mazue's style of music?
Ben Mazue is without doubt the surprise of the contemporary rap world. This young man from Biot was not destined to be a rapper. However, it was when he arrived in Paris with his parents that he discovered it. It is through this style of music that he tries to drown his feelings on paper that he accompanies with rap music. His music has been influenced by the famous Alain Souchon, Renaud and Jacques Brel.

The essence of his music comes from rap, but also from African music and American soul. These different influences place him at the crossroads between grand slam, rap, soul music and reggae. In 2011, Ben Mazué made his name on the scene with his first album. It is an autobiographical album that raises awareness and shows that taking care of oneself means taking care of others.

Over the years, the artist has made a name for himself through his art and his desire to impact the world through his melodies. As a result, rapper Ben Mazué has become one of the icons of rap music in Europe and even worldwide.

Considered one of the decade's most important superstars of the Middle East & Arab world, Ajram has sold, by 2007, over 30 million records ranking 3rd best selling female artist in Lebanese history. Ajram has secured a sensational status in the Middle East by releasing seven albums to date, numerous music videos and commercials; Ajram has participated in the most significant Arabic festivals and won plenty of awards, most importantly the 2008 World Music Award of best-selling Arab/Middle Eastern artist. Nancy Ajram is the first and only female sponsor and spokesperson of Coca-Cola in the Middle East & Arab world.

Ajram was born on May 16th, 1983 to Nabil Ajram and Rimonda Oun, as the eldest of two siblings, Nadine Nariman Ajram and Nabil Ajram Jr. She started singing at the age of eight, when she appeared for the first time in 1991 at a singing contest for kids on national television in Lebanon.

Ajram studied music following her early success with renowned Lebanese musicians and although she was less than 18 years old, the syndicate of professional artists in Lebanon accepted her as a member because they found her to be an exceptional talent and deserved to be qualified as a professional artist.

His second album, Because of You, was released May 1, 2007. The first single from the platinum-selling album was ""Because of You"".

255,toni braxton,1215098,14386771,"Toni Michelle Braxton (born October 7, 1967 in Severn, Maryland) is an American R&B/adult-pop/contemporary singer, songwriter, and actress who was popular during the 1990s and the new millennium with hits like ""Un-Break My Heart"", ""You're Makin' Me High"", ""He Wasn't Man Enough"" and ""Breathe Again"".

 She has won 7 Grammy Awards. The RIAA named Braxton as one of the top selling R&B artists of all time.

She first burst onto the scene in 1992 on the Boomerang soundtrack, after Anita Baker turned down the opportunity. In 1993 Toni released her self-titled debut album, which stayed at the top of the charts for a year and was a critically acclaimed album.

Toni released her sophomore effort, Secrets in 1996 which also did very well on both R&B and Pop charts. From that album Toni got two #1 hits; ""You're Making Me High ""and ""Unbreak My Heart"", which spent 14 consecutive weeks at #1 on the Billboard top 100, and was a worldwide hit. After 5 Grammy awards and a little break, Toni Braxton came back strong with her 2000 album The Heat. Though not as successful as her first two albums,   The Heat   went on to sell 4 million copies and spawned the huge hits ""He Wasn't Man Enough""and ""Just Be A Man About It"".

Toni has released two further albums, 2002's More Than a Woman and 2005's Libra. Toni's sixth studio album Pulse was released in May 2010 via Atlantic Records. The singles ""Yesterday"" and ""Hands Tied"" were the biggest hits. Subsequent singles to be released from ""Pulse"" include ""Make My Heart"" and ""Woman.""

In January 2011, the WE Television Network confirmed that it had signed Toni and the rest of the Braxton family for a reality series, Braxton Family Values, which will be marketed as one of the network's flagship shows. The series debuted April 12, 2011, and looks at the relationship between Toni, her mother, and her four sisters; Trina, Tamar, Traci and Towanda — all aspiring singers themselves — along with the interpersonal relationships of each family member. The show also looked at Braxton's heavily publicized separation from estranged husband, singer Keri Lewis. Toni parted ways with her long time manager Vincent Herbert (who was also the husband of sister Tamar Braxton at the time), and signed a new management deal with Los Angeles-based entertainment/production company 'The Collective'.

In 2014, Toni released a collaborative album with Babyface entitled Love, Marriage & Divorce; primarily inspired by their individual divorces (Toni with Keri, and Babyface with Tracey Edmonds). The album was supported by the singles ""Hurt You"", ""Where Did We Go Wrong"" and ""Roller Coaster""; and won Best R&B Album in the 57th Annual Grammy Awards (2015).

Toni's long-awaited eighth album Sex & Cigarettes was released on Def Jam in March 2018, which was supported by the singles ""Deadwood"", ""Long as I Live"" and ""FOH"". The album also featured a sole guest appearance from singer Colbie Caillat, and was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Best R&B Album in the 61st awards ceremony (2019).

Signing to Island Records in 2020, Toni released her ninth album Spell My Name in August 2020, featuring collaborations with H.E.R. & Missy Elliott. The album was released to positive reception, but was her lowest-charting album yet, peaking at #163 on the Billboard 200. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Toni+Braxton"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

271,eddy de pretto,64202,1618226,"Eddy de Pretto naît le 2 mai 1993 et grandit à Créteil, dans le Val-de-Marne, aux côtés de son père, chauffeur de poids-lourd et fan de football, et de sa mère, technicienne de laboratoire « passionnée de culture », d'origine réunionnaise. La ville natale à laquelle fait référence sa chanson Beaulieue et à laquelle il doit beaucoup, lui a donné « une certaine rage, une envie de me dépasser. Il y a un peu ce truc de carcan en banlieue, qu'on le veuille ou non : on nous dit qu'on est en marge, qu'on va arriver à rien, qu'on va mal finir. Moi j'avais des rêves plein la tête et une petite voix me disait que j'allais y arriver. L'envie de m'en sortir m'a aidé à y parvenir », raconte-t-il dans une interview.

À l’âge de douze ans, il commence à prendre des cours de théâtre, de chant, de technique vocale et de piano : « Je prenais la télécommande pour faire un micro et je tournais l’halogène pour faire la lumière. Du coup ma mère m’a proposé de prendre des cours de théâtre vu que je n’excellais pas au sport». Il poursuit sa formation à l'Institut supérieur des arts de la scène (ECM-ISAS), à Paris.

Eddy de Pretto fait ses premiers pas d'acteur en commençant par la publicité télévisée, notamment dans le rôle du jeune Jules César pour CanalSat en septembre 201010,11, avant d'entamer dans le monde théâtral et celui de cinématographique : les courts métrages Königsberg de Philipp Mayrhofer en 2012 et Vivre sa vie de Paul D. Meyer en 2013 ainsi qu'une apparition dans le long métrage Paulette (2013) de Jérôme Enrico.

Entre dix-huit et dix-neuf ans, il commence à écrire ses chansons. Il chante la première fois I Believe I Can Fly de R. Kelly devant le public de la Maison des jeunes et de la culture (MJC) de son quartier : « J’étais tout frêle, […] tellement stressé parce qu’il y avait beaucoup de rap et je n’étais pas du tout dans ces codes-là », raconte-t-il dans une interview.

Il participe au Printemps de Bourges, dont il remporte le prix des Inouïs, et à Bars en Trans, et est lauréat des inRocKs Lab 20162. Il se joint également en octobre 2017 au Festival Off Off Off des Nuits de Champagne à Troyes.

Kid et Cure
Il sort son premier EP, intitulé Kid, le 6 octobre 2017. Pour les lives de son EP, il lance les morceaux depuis son iPhone relié à un câble, il n’a pas de musicien excepté un batteur lors de ses concerts.

Début janvier 2018, sur la scène de l'émission de télévision Taratata, il chante Comme un boomerang en duo avec Julien Doré, jadis interprétée par Dani et Étienne Daho15 en 2001.

À la mi-janvier 2018 il lance Random, la première chanson de son futur premier album Cure16, évoquant ses peines de cœur16.

Aux côtés de Gaël Faye et Fishbach, il est nommé dans la catégorie « Révélation scène de l’année » à la 33e cérémonie des Victoires de la musique qui se déroule le 9 février 201817,16,18 : Gaël Faye en est le vainqueur.

Mi-février 2018, il présente son titre Ego sur « une instrumentale épurée et mécanique » et à propos duquel l’interprète s’explique : « Je pose l’éventualité de devenir dingue à cause de la vitesse à laquelle va le projet. À force d'entendre des éloges, le « trop de soi » implose, et c'est le risque que j’expose ici. La peur simple de tomber dans le fanatisme de soi-même par les réseaux sociaux, les mots d'amour, et tout autre signe qui flatte et qui crée ce monstre d'ego. »

Le 2 mars 2018, il sort son premier album Cure, disponible en CD, vinyle et en version dématérialisée. En même temps se révèle le clip de Normal abordant stéréotypes sur l'identité sexuelle, peur d'autrui et homophobie : « Une colère vis-à-vis de gens qui m’attaquaient parce qu'ils n’aimaient pas la personne que je pouvais représenter », explique-t-il dans le magazine Têtu. Le clip est tourné au centre des YMCA, rue de Trévise à Paris dans la plus vielle salle de basket-ball au monde[réf. nécessaire]. Une semaine après sa sortie, le disque se classe numéro un des meilleures ventes d'albums, avec 13 500 exemplaires et « déloge » Grand Corps Malade au Top albums France Fnac. L'album est certifié en France disque de platine. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Eddy+De+Pretto"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

272,mokita,268748,3457270,"There appear to be two bands called Mokita.

1) UK London based Artist/Producer/Songwriter. 
Mokita blends the organic tone of natural instrumentation and plaintive vocals with a unique, subtle, electronic production. Giving bittersweet gems that explore the journey of personal experience, Mokita deliver the intimacy and desire sorely needed in music. Having collaborated with acclaimed producer Mike Nielsen (Jamiroquai, Underworld) and had two tracks 'Made of Stone' and 'Two Words' selected as Record of The Day the music industry's unofficial tastemaker, Mokita was No1. on the Indiestore download chart as well as becoming a published Artist/Songwriter. www.mokitamusic.com
Debut album release via itunes- 'answers within earshot' available 03-11-08 



2) Mokita were a four-piece band from London. They are probably best described as edging into the post-hardcore genre, taking influences from bands such as Fugazi, Nirvana, At the Drive-In, Mclusky, though there are spatterings of the mid-90s Brit sounds of bands such as Radiohead. Their final line up was:
Theo (now in Pocus Whiteface, with previous Mokita drummer Joe)
Muppet
John (formerly of One Time Friend and The Gloves)
Ruth (formerly of The Gloves now in Sinking Cruise Ship Rescue Drama) <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mokita"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
273,c.c. catch,173320,2211473,"Caroline Catharina Müller (born July 31, 1964), known as C.C.Catch, is a German pop singer and composer.

Caroline was born in Oss (the Netherlands). She moved with her family to Germany in the late 1970s. In 1980 she was a member of the girl quartet ""Optimal"". After that (starting in 1985) she cooperated with Dieter Bohlen under the name C.C.Catch.

Dieter Bohlen was the driving force behind her records, writing and producing all the songs. This was the main reason for the ending of their collaboration in 1989. Caroline wanted to participate in the creative process by contributing her own material, but Dieter did not agree.
Her biggest hits are ""I Can Lose My Heart Tonight"", "" Cause you are young"", ""Heartbreak Hotel"" all released in 1985 proved to be major hits in mainland Europe.

Müller went on to have Gold and Platinum selling albums and gain a sizable fanbase. The Caroline Müller and Dieter Bohlen partnership became to wane by the late 1980s. Müller wanted to participate in the creative process by contributing her own material, but Bohlen did not agree. This led to the split between singer and producer in 1989. The same year she recorded in England an album Hear What I Say, partially produced by Andy Taylor of Duran Duran.Produced in London by Andy Taylor, Dave Clayton and Joe Dworniak, it was markedly different in style from her previous releases and contained seven songs co-written by the artist herself.

The album was only a moderate success, possibly because the public had a hard time accepting her drastic change of style. C.C. Catch's former label Hansa might have also contributed to that situation, by simultaneously issuing a compilation of her Bohlen-produced hits. Subsequently C.C. Catch retired from the music business, became interested in meditation and married a yoga teacher in London.

She made her return in 1999 with regular successful concerts and touring. She finally released her new single, ""Silence"", written by Müller herself, in 2004. ""Silence"" became a moderate hit. It just missed the Top 40 of the German Pop chart, peaking at #47. She has continued her career, but with moderate success. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/C.C.+Catch"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The guys went on to adapt their style to be darker, harder-edged, and more punk-influenced, and they reformed as the Alarm, which had more commercial success.
