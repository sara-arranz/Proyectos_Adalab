28,piso 21,272067,4694532,"Juan David Castaño (el llanero), David Escobar (Dim), Juan David Huertas (El profe) y Pablo Mejía (Pablito), son los integrantes del grupo que ahora suena en las emisoras de la ciudad de medellin, Piso 21.

El mayor tiene solo 26 años y el menor 21. Son jóvenes, sí, pero ya son conscientes de su éxito y más que un grupo, ellos se consideran una familia, pues lo más importante, antes de cantar, es la unión y la lealtad a su amistad.

Todo comenzó en junio del año 2007 cuando se conocieron en un asado que organizó un amigo que tenían en común. Conversando se dieron cuenta de que los cuatro eran músicos y terminaron cantando hasta las 6 de la mañana.

Días después El Profe buscó a Dim y al Llanero y les propuso formar un grupo, pero Dim dijo que sí con la condición de que también incluyeran a Pablito, quien estaba de viaje en ese momento en Contadora, Panamá.

Fue tanta la emoción y la ansiedad por crear el grupo que inmediatamente llamaron a Pablito a Panamá y el aceptó sin dudarlo.

Paso a paso
Su segundo encuentro, o mejor dicho su primer ensayo, fue en el club house de un amigo del edificio San Mitchel, en el piso 21, desde donde se podía ver la ciudad d medellin completa. Este se convirtió durante varios meses en su ensayadero oficial y era allí donde pasaban noches enteras montando las canciones.

""Durante esas noches soñábamos con que algún día escucharían nuestras composiciones en todas esas casa que veíamos desde allá"", cuenta Dim.

""Y creo que lo estamos logrando, pero ahora la idea es que también nos escuchen en aquellas de las que solo veíamos la luz, arriba en las montañas"", continúa El Profe.

Su nombre
A la hora de pensar en cómo se llamarían, dieron muchas vueltas y hasta lo consultaron con sus familias y sus profesores.

Al principio le buscaron por el lado de sus iniciales o pensaron en jugar un poco con los nombres de David y Pablo, pero luego de intentarlo por muchos lados, se les ocurrió Piso 21, pues fue a esta altura donde realmente conformaron el grupo.

Pero a este nombre también le han encontrado una metáfora, pues según ellos, indica que para arriba es adonde quieren llegar, dando pasos lentos, pero seguros y muy largos.

Precisamente antes de empezar cada concierto, el grupo se reúne para gritar su frase favorita ""Piso 21, vamos pa'arriba papá"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Piso+21"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

32,ryan castro,283169,5213126,"Ryan Castro es una de las nuevas caras del reggaetón y, aunque en sus videos juega con la clásica estética aspiracional de los carros de alta gama y las mansiones, su proyecto nació en el barrio Pedregal, al norte de Medellín. El colegio, las calles y los vecinos del sector pueden dar fe de cómo fue el comienzo de su historia.

Luego de salir del colegio, a los 16 años, se proyectó para hacer música a nivel profesional. Inspirado por las música y las películas que vio de 50 Cent, Eminem o Daddy Yankee, Ryan salió a buscar su primer público: los usuarios del transporte urbano.

“Empecé a cantar en los buses a los 17 años porque empecé a sentir la necesidad de hacer algo y ayudar a la familia. La experiencia fue muy bacana y enriquecedora porque me hizo ganar mucha confianza”, cuenta el paisa.

En los buses hacía covers de Kafu Banton, de Baroni One Time y una que otra composición original. Su segunda gran plataforma fueron las discotecas del Valle de Aburrá, donde también cantó sus propias canciones como Morena, que es un rap romántico, y Mi Styling, un dancehall.

Luego de tocar varias puertas y ver limitadas sus oportunidades tomó la decisión de irse del país para trabajar, ahorrar dinero e invertirlo en su proyecto. Llegó a Curazao y trabajó en hoteles y restaurantes. Cada peso que ganó lo usó para costear sus producciones y los videos musicales.

En Curazao grabó dos canciones y gracias al bendito internet logró que se sonaran en su natal Medallo. Muchos creyeron que Ryan era extranjero.

Esas canciones vincularon a Ryan con la compañía discográfica del caleño Kevin Roldán. Para 2021, su nombre estará dos veces en el nuevo álbum de Kevin Roldán y, además, lanzará su disco debut que lleva por nombre El Cantante Del Guetto, un homenaje a sus raíces y su barrio. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Castro"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The young duo, Mau y Ricky, sons of music icon Ricardo Montaner, have released the album's first single, ""Voy Que Quemo,"" a song they decided best represents the music that is coming out in the LP, expected to release in July. ""After writing so many songs, it just seemed natural to start recording an album,"" Ricky, 25, tells Billboard, speaking on behalf of the duo since Mau was on vocal rest. ""We have 10 songs and an 11th that is an instrumental track. 'Voy Que Quemo' seemed like the best song to release first, and we're feeling super excited and nervous.""

Mau y Ricky partnered with Latin Grammy winner Julio Reyes Copello to produce their album and credit him for allowing them to grow artistically and teach them about following their intuition. ""We've grown as producers and songwriters, thanks to him. We also learned that the intuition of an artist is so important and it's something that needs to be respected because your intuition will differentiate you from others. We learned to write for ourselves and put out songs that will represent who we are.""

And that's exactly what Mau y Ricky did. They followed their intuition after listening to their song ""Arte"" which was almost going to be pitched to Wisin, but Ricky says, ""It didn't feel right for another artist to sing this song."" Another man they have to thank for guiding them since they started composing at a very young age is their father, who has written hit singles like ""La Cima del Cielo,"" ""Déjame Llorar"" and ""Me Va a Extrañar.""

""We've written songs together, so working with him helps you grow a lot because he's a very hard critic. Every song I've written since I was 8 years old, I'd run it by him and he'd give me feedback. He actually just heard the final product of our album and he loved it, thank God. But the best thing is that he's a fan of ours and we're huge fans of him. Yeah, he's my dad, but I'm a huge Ricardo Montaner fan.""

Besides a new album, Mau y Ricky fans can expect to see them onstage soon as they go out on tour.

Hailing from Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Natasha grew up surrounded by endless musical influences and enrolled in Santiago’s School of Fine Arts at the age of seven where she developed her singing abilities, describing her time at the school as “one of the best of her life.” Her studio experience would begin as a teenager when she would record songs as a hobby and later alongside friends.

This all led up to her decision to make the biggest and riskiest move of her life, and that was to move to the United States. She settled in the Bronx, New York, or “the City of the Dreams and Dreamers” for young, aspiring musicians like her at the time. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Natti called the move “one of the craziest moves anyone ever did in her family,” and that she often looks back at the decision and wonders what she was doing. Natti would hop from studio to studio, working without pay, but to her, this was a way to get her name out there. A producer friend from Santiago would soon step in and lend her his New York studio.

Natti’s first-ever break came when icon Don Omar signed her to his record label, the Orfanato Music Group, and the pair would go on to make history for years to come. Their collaborations “Dutty Love,” “Tus Movimientos,” “Perdido en tus Ojos,” and a “Hold Ya” remix with Gyptian made waves across Latin America and introduced the world to future reggaeton royalty. Her debut project, an EP titled “All About Me” was released on March 28, 2012.

Natti would continue to make big career moves throughout the years including her departure from Don Omar’s record label and signing onto Pina Records in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2017 when her big breakout would come once and for all. Not only did she record and release a collaboration titled “Otra Cosa” alongside the legendary Daddy Yankee, but she also released what was arguably the biggest song of 2017. “Criminal” featuring Ozuna became an instant hit upon its release, the music video amassing over 1 billion views in just five months and becoming the most watched music video by a female singer released that year.

2019 saw the release of her much-anticipated debut album, “ilumiNATTI,” on February 15. 15 tracks made up the project with two collaborations in total, “Te Lo Dije'' with Anitta and “Soy Mía” with Kany García. Standout track “La Mejor Version de Mi” would transform into a bachata hit with its remix featuring bachata king Romeo Santos.

Natti’s sophomore album titled “NATTIVIDAD” would be released two years later on September 24, 2021 with 17 tracks featuring several chart-topping collaborators such as Becky G, Maluma, and Prince Royce. The release was followed up by the six-episode docuseries titled “Everybody Loves Natti” which documented her pregnancy and relationship with fiancé Raphy Pina. The series premiered on November 19, 2021 on Amazon Prime Video and was generally well received. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Natti+Natasha"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

51,j balvin,1405626,47612739,"José Álvaro Osorio Balvin (born May 7, 1985), known professionally as J Balvin, is a Colombian reggaeton singer. Balvin was born in Medellín, Colombia, where he became interested in music at a young age. At age 17, he moved to the United States and learned English, which influenced the music he would make later. He then returned to Medellín and gained local popularity by performing at various clubs around the city.

Though his music is primarily reggaeton, J Balvin has experimented with a variety of musical genres in his work, including electronica, house music, trap, and R&B. He has collaborated with artists such as Pharrell Williams, Major Lazer, and Sean Paul. Despite working with many English-speaking artists, J Balvin continues to sing almost exclusively in Spanish, and hopes to introduce Spanish-language music to a global audience. He is also noted for his eclectic and colorful fashion sense. 

Balvin's breakthrough came in 2014 with the single ""6 AM"" featuring Puerto Rican singer Farruko which peaked at. The song, along with the single ""Ay Vamos"", bolstered sales of his debut album La Familia. In 2016, he released Energia, which included the hit singles ""Ginza"", ""Bobo"", ""Safari"", and ""Sigo Extranandote"". In June 2017, J Balvin released the single ""Mi Gente"" with Willy William, which achieved international success and later reached one billion views on YouTube. This preceded the release of his fifth full-length album, titled Vibras, the concept for which was developed from the moment ""Mi Gente"" started ""connecting with audiences around the world,"" presented as a fusion of reggaeton with different worldwide styles and rhythms. It received favorable reviews from critics and audiences alike, with Juana Giaimo of The Guardian praising the sound of the reggaeton music on the album by calling it ""smooth"" and ""sensual"", and dubbing it the ""perfect party playlist, [which] confirms that the noisy style of early reggaeton hits such as Daddy Yankee's 'Gasolina' is slowly being left behind.""

He has also collaborated with Cardi B and Bad Bunny on the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single ""I Like It"".  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/J+Balvin"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Cazzu es una artista de música urbana que se caracteriza por haber sido siempre muy voluble. Ha trabajado muchos estilos durante toda su carrera, pero encontró en el trap y el reguetón su verdadero lenguaje. El trap es por definición un compendio de géneros aglutinados, y Cazzu conoce perfectamente todos y cada uno de ellos.


La trapera estudió cine, y su conocimiento de la estética visual le ha ayudado mucho a la hora de conformar la suya propia. Su estilo es desinhibición en estado puro. Cargada de energía, para dar caña con cada tema.

Cazzu, con temas suaves que invitan a bailar y a moverse, es conocedora de todos esos géneros tan interesantes que conforman el trap argentino. Por ello, la trapera es sin duda una de las reinas del trap latino e internacional.

Se presentó en el panorama con su primer tema Killa. Una canción que sienta unas bases muy claras, una carta de presentación como mujer empoderada, llena de espíritu underground. La artista se ha ganado el respeto de todos los artistas de trap del panorama latino, llegando a colaborar con muchos de ellos.

Sus colaboracion con Bad Bunny, Duki y Khea en LOCA y LOCA REMIX es un himno del trap mundial.

65,farruko,665355,8402805,"Farruko is a reggaeton and Latin pop singer from Puerto Rico. His given name is Carlos Efren Reyes, and he was born in Bayamon, Puerto Rico in 1991. At the age of 16, he began to post his songs under his stage name to MySpace. His first single, ""Sexo Fuera del Planeta,"" gained thousands of followers, and from there he explored the potential of other social media networks. Due to his massive success on the Internet, he came to the attention of Puerto Rican radio and music industry executives, who enlisted his vocal talents for other artists.

Farruko's debut album, El Talento del Bloque, appeared when he was 18. It was released by Siente Music and distributed by Universal. Most of its 13 songs were self-penned. The set became an almost instant hit, and several singles followed from it. Some of the album's highlights included its collaborative tunes such as ""Su Hija Me Gusta"" with José Feliciano, ""Ella No Es Facil"" with Cosculluela, and ""Traime a Tu Amiga"" with Arcangel and Julio Voltio. He also issued the non-album smash ""Pa Romper la Discoteca"" with Daddy Yankee and Yomo. In 2012, he issued his sophomore offering, TMPR: The Most Powerful Rookie. Its first smash single was ""Feel the Rhythm"" (""Siente el Ritmo""), though it was one of five. As a whole, the set demonstrated that Farruko was as comfortable in electro and pop circles as he was in reggaeton; it was nominated for a Latin Grammy.

After touring throughout Latin America and the United States and establishing large fan bases in locales such as Venezuela and Colombia, he returned to recording in 2014. Farruko Presenta los Menores was released in late October of that year. A week after its release, it topped the Latin Albums chart. Among the notable collaborations are ""Salgo"" with Arcangel, Ñengo Flow, D. Ozi, and Genio y Kelmitt; ""Bebe Conmigo"" with J. Balvin; and ""Interesada"" with Luigi 21+. He won the Premios Juventud for the song ""6 AM"" with J. Balvin and Latin Grammy Awards for Best Urban Performance and Best Urban Song in 2015. In February of that year, he released ""Lejos de Aquí,"" a remix with Yandel. In June, he was Alejandra Guzman's surprise duet partner on her first urban single, ""Adios."" In July, he issued the pre-release track ""Sunset"" (featuring Shaggy and Nicky Jam), which garnered the top spot on various Latin airplay charts. In August, Farruko issued The Ones, a compilation of his charting singles and collaborations; it was a teaser for his next studio effort, Visionary, which appeared in late October. Pre-order excitement for the album propelled it to debut at number one on several Latin album charts; it remained there for several weeks after release. In 2017, he returned with his sixth studio album, Trapficante. As its title suggested, the artist put his money on the fusion of reggaeton and pop urban with the second generation of Latin trap, the latter he considered still in its infancy, making some commercial inroads but still far from its future force as the face of commercial mainstream Latin X pop -- despite its outlaw ties. He openly desired being the face of that future and drew on a host of new generation Latin trap artists as collaborators including Frank Miami, Sharo Torres, Rome, Mambo Kingz, DJ Luian, Maffio, Lil Geniuz, Bad Bunny, and Ladkani. The album was issued in September as Farruko undertook the U.S. leg of his global TrapXFicante tour. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Farruko"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He is one of the most well known reggaeton artists in Latin America. His cross over success in the U.S. has given him more exposure to English speaking Reggaeton fans, making him one of the more recognizable faces of Reggaeton along with Daddy Yankee and Tego Calderón. Don Omar's popularity is currently rising and he recently appeared on MTV. Omar is best known for his songs ""Dile"" and ""Dale Don Dale"" from his first album The Last Don and ""Reggaeton Latino"". His songs center around life and love; some examples of these would be ""La Recompenza"" (The Reward), ""Pobre Diabla"" (Poor Devil (fem.)) and ""Aunque te Fuiste"" (Even Though You Left).

His debut album, The Last Don, sold over 350,000 units in South America. Both ""The Last Don"" as the live edition of it have been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Worldwide, The Last Don: Live [CD & DVD] sold over one million copies, according to the official website. His debut single, ""Dale Don Dale"", sold over 100,000 copies in South America. He received the awards for ""Latin Pop Album of the Year"" and ""New Artist & Latin Rap/Hip-Hop Album of the Year"" by the Billboard Latin Music Awards in 2003. The Last Don: Live [CD & DVD] was also nominated for ""Urban Music Album"" at the 2005 Latin Grammy Awards

He started his career after facing many obstacles when Héctor Delgado (from the duo Héctor y Tito) gave him an opportunity to be a backup singer. After that, he sang in a live concert with Héctor and Tito in 2003, which was released later as a CD and DVD, which included the songs that became instant hits, Baila Morena and Amor de Colegio.

In 2005, Don Omar released the reggaeton album ""Da Hitman Presents Reggaeton Latino"", which broke the record for ""Highest First Week Sales for a Reggaeton Album"" by selling over 31,000 units in its first week, resulting a debut of #61 in The Billboard 200. Wisin y Yandel held that record until ""Reggaeton Latino"" was released.

The first single released from Reggaeton Latino, ""Dale Don Dale [Remix]"" , which features rapper Fabolous, debuted at #1 on the crossover chart.

He is currently signed to VI Music through Universal Music Latino.

In early 2006, the Governor of Puerto Rico, Aníbal Acevedo Vilá publicly mentioned interest in having Don Omar participate in a program against School Desertion. However, the Secretary of Education has rejected Don Omar sponsoring it due to his lyrics. The local press has also mentioned that Omar himself did not finish High School.

Currently has his own record label ""El Orfanato"" (The Orphanage) and had a magnificent performance in the 2011 Latin Music Billboard Awards where he received the Award for Latin Rythm Airplay. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Don+Omar"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Noise—composed of DJs, MCs, producers, and club coordinators—hosted a long-lasting series of club nights in San Juan that were vital to the development and popularization of reggaeton. DJ Nelson earned credit as one of the top Noise DJs, and he also served as a producer/arranger for the collective's music.

In 1997 he made his CD debut, Nel-Zone, which was split into respective reggae and rap mixes, and he also was credited on a couple other CD releases that year: Don Chezina's Bien Guillao de Gangster and Ivy Queen's En Mi Imperio (1997). From this point forward, DJ Nelson began focusing on his solo career, primarily as a producer, with notable credits including Ivy Queen's The Original Rude Girl (1998) and Wisin & Yandel's Los Reyes del Nuevo Milenio (2000). His mixtape-style productions continued as well, with Undertrack Collection (2000) and Music (2001), the latter of which marked the advent of his personal brand, Flow Music.
DJ Nelson signed to this label a trio of young, up-and-coming producers: Francisco Saldaña, Víctor Cabrera, Norgie Noriega, the former two of whom are better known as Luny Tunes, of course, while the latter goes by just Noriega. These three producers pooled their talents together for Mas Flow (2003), a mixtape album that was groundbreaking in terms of popularity and influence. Numerous volumes followed, except without Noriega, who went the solo route, debuting with Contra la Corriente (2004). DJ Nelson continued with his own career as well, releasing Flow la Discoteka (2004) and opening a club of the same name, at which he was the resident DJ. In addition, he is credited with having set up The Mix 107.7, a popular Puerto Rican radio station hosted by DJ Coyote, and he even took his brand into the clothing industry, forming Flow Wear. Released in 2007, Flow la Discoteka, Vol. 2 featured his biggest hit single to date, ""Pasarela"", performed by Dalmata. DJ Nelson, Gerardo Cruet and Arcangel, consider themselves as pioneers in the new ""urban movement"", a sub-genre of reggaeton and hip-hop, Electro-Flow. Electro-Flow as Arcangel baptized it, is a blend of Hip-hop, reggaeton, dance-hall, electronica, and other futuristic sounds. Electro-flow can be heard in the songs. ""Chica Virtual"", ""Pa Que la Pases Bien"", ""Te Estoy Buscando"". ""Sexy Movimiento"", ""Siguelo"", ""Dame un Poquito"" by Wisin y Yandel. ""Veo Veo"" by Yaga y Mackie Ranks. Also ""Let's Do It"" ""No te Veo"" all are considered Electro-flow. Some songs lean more towards dance Hip Hop while some lean more towards Reggaeton depending on the song. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Nelson"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

108,kele,259794,3554787,"Rowland Kelechukwu Okereke (born 13 October 1981), also known by the mononym Kele, is an English musician, probably best known as the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of the indie rock band Bloc Party.

Kele Okereke released his first solo album, titled The Boxer  on 21 June 2010, through Wichita / Polydor in the UK and Europe and Glassnote Records for the rest of the world. The album was released under the name Kele, dropping his surname. Okereke explained the album title, saying ""as a boxer, you have to rely on nobody else but yourself to achieve what it is you want to achieve. Even though you take hits, you have to keep focus on your priorities and keep going. I thought that was an inspiring image"". The first single from the album Tenderoni was released on 14 June 2010.

Okereke sees the 'Kele' brand as a way for him to embrace his interest in dance music. ""I've been into clubbing for years. I've said from the beginning I'm into dance, it gets me excited and I think this record is going to go some way to prove that to people, hopefully."" - Kele Okereke

In September 2011 it was announced that Kele would be releasing a follow up to The Boxer; an EP titled The Hunter.

On 23 July 2014 Kele announced his second solo album, entitled Trick, to be released on his own label Lilac Records via Kobalt Label Services on 13 October 2014.

He released his third album Fatherland on 6 October 2017 under his full name Kele Okereke. The album features the singles Streets Been Talking and Grounds For Resentment feat. Olly Alexander. Fatherland also features the duet Versions of Us with Grammy-winning English singer and songwriter Corinne Bailey Rea

In January 2019, Leave to Remain a new musical written by Okereke and Matt Jones debuted in London. Announced in September 2018, the musical about an interracial gay couple was preceded by the single Not the Drugs Talking which showed a move back towards beats following the more acoustic Fatherland. Telling a love story through the Prism of Brexit, the new show is accompanied by a tie-in album of new songs. Speaking about the subject matter and his feelings on the UK in 2019, Okereke claimed that “It’s not a time that I’ve been proud to be British. It’s an ugly time”.
