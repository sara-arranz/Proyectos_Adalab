Known for his variegated vocals, Malone has gained acclaim for blending genres and subgenres of hip-hop, pop, R&B, and trap.

Austin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York. He was raised by his father, Richard Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip-hop, country, and rock. When Malone was nine years old, he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys. Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game Guitar Hero.

Malone has always had a love for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event. According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band. He says soon afterward he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip-hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.

According to Malone, he chose ""Post Malone"" as his stage name when he was 14 or 15. The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone, but Malone later explained that ""Post"" is his last name, and he used a ""rap name generator"" to get ""Malone"". At 16, using the audio editor Audacity, Malone created his first mixtape, Young and After Them Riches. He showed it to some of his classmates at Grapevine High School. He was voted ""Most Likely to Become Famous"" by his classmates as a senior in high school. He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.

In August 2016, Malone issued an apology for his album, Stoney, being late. It was available for pre-order on November 4 and was finally released on December 9.

7,7,natti natasha,306506,4359458,"Natalia Alexandra Gutiérrez, known by her stage name Natti Natasha, is a Dominican reggaeton singer, songwriter, and actress. Hailing from Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Natasha grew up surrounded by endless musical influences and enrolled in Santiago’s School of Fine Arts at the age of seven where she developed her singing abilities, describing her time at the school as “one of the best of her life.” Her studio experience would begin as a teenager when she would record songs as a hobby and later alongside friends.

This all led up to her decision to make the biggest and riskiest move of her life, and that was to move to the United States. She settled in the Bronx, New York, or “the City of the Dreams and Dreamers” for young, aspiring musicians like her at the time. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Natti called the move “one of the craziest moves anyone ever did in her family,” and that she often looks back at the decision and wonders what she was doing. Natti would hop from studio to studio, working without pay, but to her, this was a way to get her name out there. A producer friend from Santiago would soon step in and lend her his New York studio.

Natti’s first-ever break came when icon Don Omar signed her to his record label, the Orfanato Music Group, and the pair would go on to make history for years to come. Their collaborations “Dutty Love,” “Tus Movimientos,” “Perdido en tus Ojos,” and a “Hold Ya” remix with Gyptian made waves across Latin America and introduced the world to future reggaeton royalty. Her debut project, an EP titled “All About Me” was released on March 28, 2012.

Natti would continue to make big career moves throughout the years including her departure from Don Omar’s record label and signing onto Pina Records in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2017 when her big breakout would come once and for all. Not only did she record and release a collaboration titled “Otra Cosa” alongside the legendary Daddy Yankee, but she also released what was arguably the biggest song of 2017. “Criminal” featuring Ozuna became an instant hit upon its release, the music video amassing over 1 billion views in just five months and becoming the most watched music video by a female singer released that year.

2019 saw the release of her much-anticipated debut album, “ilumiNATTI,” on February 15. 15 tracks made up the project with two collaborations in total, “Te Lo Dije'' with Anitta and “Soy Mía” with Kany García. Standout track “La Mejor Version de Mi” would transform into a bachata hit with its remix featuring bachata king Romeo Santos.

Natti’s sophomore album titled “NATTIVIDAD” would be released two years later on September 24, 2021 with 17 tracks featuring several chart-topping collaborators such as Becky G, Maluma, and Prince Royce. The release was followed up by the six-episode docuseries titled “Everybody Loves Natti” which documented her pregnancy and relationship with fiancé Raphy Pina. The series premiered on November 19, 2021 on Amazon Prime Video and was generally well received. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Natti+Natasha"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

""Nobody needs to write a bio for me. This is stupid. My name is SAINt JHN, that's my real name, it's spelled a little different tho. I'm from Brooklyn, I spent half of my childhood growing up in Georgetown, Guyana. I was dirt poor in Brooklyn and some version of rich in Guyana, because apparently 2 nickles can buy you a sports car in a 3rd world country. Who knew?! I'm from a SUPER Christian household where my mom forced us to go to every church imaginable, EVERY, SINGLE, WEEK! I hated it. I still won't go to church to this day. I'm a product of a father that was a hustler, preacher for a mother and a rapper for an older brother. Jay z and Beenie Man were my musical hero's growing up. I don't know how to describe the music I make, don't know what genre it belongs to and I don't exactly care. I make what I want to hear and paint the pictures that I want to see in the world. I got my start writing songs for other people, I got lucky I don't know how that happened but I did. I wrote some records for Usher, Kiesza, Gorgon City and a few other people. I was having success, but then I quit, cause who wants to live their dreams through someone else's eyes. So I put out my first project, Collection One. And here we are now, I hope you like whatever comes next cause I have no fvcking idea!""

A collision of feelings, ideas, and misty ambiance, SAINt JHN's music is a living mosaic. Pulling from his dual upbringing in Guyana and Brooklyn, he swirls themes of love, joy and sorrow with emotive R&B, Hip-Hop and Afrofusion into an inimitable kaleidoscope of sounds and sensations. You could call it genre-fluid but it's easier to say it's SAINt JHN, a singer-songwriter and model who has earned two Grammy Awards and a global fan base while becoming one of the most distinct voices in the world of music.

Cazzu es una artista de música urbana que se caracteriza por haber sido siempre muy voluble. Ha trabajado muchos estilos durante toda su carrera, pero encontró en el trap y el reguetón su verdadero lenguaje. El trap es por definición un compendio de géneros aglutinados, y Cazzu conoce perfectamente todos y cada uno de ellos.


La trapera estudió cine, y su conocimiento de la estética visual le ha ayudado mucho a la hora de conformar la suya propia. Su estilo es desinhibición en estado puro. Cargada de energía, para dar caña con cada tema.

Cazzu, con temas suaves que invitan a bailar y a moverse, es conocedora de todos esos géneros tan interesantes que conforman el trap argentino. Por ello, la trapera es sin duda una de las reinas del trap latino e internacional.

Se presentó en el panorama con su primer tema Killa. Una canción que sienta unas bases muy claras, una carta de presentación como mujer empoderada, llena de espíritu underground. La artista se ha ganado el respeto de todos los artistas de trap del panorama latino, llegando a colaborar con muchos de ellos.

Sus colaboracion con Bad Bunny, Duki y Khea en LOCA y LOCA REMIX es un himno del trap mundial.

Black Eyed Peas went to centenary state high school and got their start in 1988 when will.i.am (born 1975 William James Adams Jr.) and apl.de.ap (born 1974 Allan Pineda) began rapping and performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to Ruthless Records (run by Eazy-E) after catching the attention of the nephew of Jerry Heller (Eazy-E's manager). Along with Mookie Mook (Burning Star), Dante Santiago & DJ Motiv8, they called their group A.T.B.A.N. Klann. Their debut album, 'Grass Roots', was not released originally because Ruthless did not consider the social themes reflected in the group's music to be marketable to their audience. A single ""Puddles of H2O"" was released in 1994 but no album was released (until it leaked onto the Internet in the mid 2000s). 

After Eazy-E died of an AIDS related illness in 1995, they changed their name to Black Eyed Peas; will.i.am explained on the front cover of the Monkey Business album that ""Black Eyed Peas are food for the soul"", hence the name. will.i.am has cited the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an influence and said he named his band after a food, like them. They replaced their original third member Mookie, with Dante Santiago the Peas original singer. Then Taboo (born Jaime Gomez) joined the group. Dante Santiago took on a role as a guest vocalist in the band and featured frequently on various tracks for their first four albums. 

In 1996, they produced and appeared on a song entitled ""That's Right"" for Brian Austin Green's hip-hop album One Stop Carnival. Later, they began using Kim Hill as a steady background singer. Unlike many hip-hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a musical and clothing style that differed wildly from the ""gangsta rap"" sounds of other Los Angeles-based hip-hop acts at the time. Through the mid-'90s, they performed in the local club circuit alongside fellow acts such as Ozomatli and Jurassic 5.

The group were signed to Interscope Records and released their debut, ""Behind the Front"", in 1998. The album won the group (and their accompanying live band, the Bucky Jonsons) critical acclaim. The album featured the single ""Joints & Jams"", which was included on the Bulworth soundtrack. Their second album, ""Bridging the Gap"", was released in 2000; it featured the single ""Request + Line"" featuring Macy Gray.

After replacing their female background singer with Fergie, the group released their breakout album, ""Elephunk"", and their 2005 album, ""Monkey Business"", which featured the hit singles ""Pump It"", ""Don't Phunk With My Heart"", ""Don't Lie"" and ""My Humps"".

""The E.N.D. (The Energy Never Dies)"", their fifth album, was released worldwide in June 2009 and has managed to sell 5 million copies in 8 months (Elephunk: 7 million, Monkey Business: 10 million). It already spawned 2 of the most downloaded singles of all time: ""Boom Boom Pow"" and ""I Gotta Feeling"", both were downloaded 5 million times only in the USA. The 3rd single ""Meet Me Halfway"" was downloaded 2 million times and the 4th ""Imma Be"", which was just released, already sold 1 million. ""Rock That Body"" is the 5th single.

In December 2014, Kirk made a quick decision to become a rapper, taking the name Baby Jesus and issuing his NonFiction mixtape a month later. Never having been on a stage before, he headed to South by Southwest in the spring of 2015. Kirk changed his name to DaBaby, going so far as to explain the ""political reasons"" for this decision in the lyrics to ""DaBaby (Intro),"" a short introduction to 2016's God's Work Resurrected, his first mixtape under the new moniker. This release featured a cameo from Boosie Badazz and began to attract the attention of fans and peers alike.

Multiple mixtapes followed in the coming months, with 2017 offering Billion Dollar Baby, Baby Talk, Baby Talk 2, 3, and 4, as well as Back on My Baby Jesus Sh!t. 2018 continued in a similarly fashion with Baby Talk 5 and Blank Blank. In November of 2018, while shopping with his family at a Walmart in Huntersville, North Carolina, Kirk was approached by several men. An altercation broke out and gunfire ensued, resulting in the death of 19-year-old Jalyn Domonique Craig. Kirk, while involved in the dispute, did not admit to firing the fatal shots and was not charged with any crime connected to the incident. DaBaby got a label deal in 2019 when he signed on with Interscope.

43,43,ynw melly,878595,28883352,"Jamell Maurice Demons (born May 1, 1999), better known by his stage name YNW Melly, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter who emerged from Gifford, Florida. YNW Melly is also co-founder of rap collective, YNW. His music often draws from his lived experiences, evidenced by his 2017 incarceration for weapons charges. Upon release, he began to gain popularity from his track “Murder On My Mind.” which he wrote while in jail. After the release of the track, he was once again arrested as the song violated his probation, and sent him back to prison.

Melly’s career initially started to take off in 2018 when singles such as “Virtual (Blue Balenciagas)”, “Butter Pecan”, and “772 Love” had begun to gain popularity alongside “Murder on My Mind.”

On August 3, 2018, Melly released his debut mixtape I AM YOU which included his popular single, “Murder on My Mind”. It also included a sequel to the song called “Mind on My Murder”.

After leaving the studio with companions YNW Bortlen, YNW SakChaser, and YNW Juvy, on the night of October 26, 2018, Melly and his friends had been caught in a drive-by-shooting where SakChaser and Juvy were murdered. Melly and Bortlen were the only survivors of the attack.

While working on his sophomore mixtape, after the death of his friends, Melly had gained more attention and began to obtain cosigns from several rappers such as Young Thug, Trippie Redd, and Kodak Black. However, on January 3, 2019, Melly was arrested for possession of marijuana.

On January 18, 2019, while incarcerated, Melly released his sophomore mixtape We All Shine, which included one of his most influential cosign’s, Kanye West who was a feature on the song “Mixed Personalities.”.

Melly was released from jail on January 25, 2019, and released “Gang”, the first day out single that had taken off after the hype around “Mixed Personalities.”

After being released for only a month, on February 13, 2019, Melly turned himself in after a warrant was put out for him and Bortlen connecting to the murders of YNW Sakchaser and YNW Juvy. YNW Melly posted this to his Instagram on February 13:

To all my fans and supporters no I did not get locked up in Washington , but I am turning myself in today I want you guys to know I love you and appreciate every single one of y'all, a couple months ago I lost my two brothers by violence and now the system want to find justice.. unfortunately a lot of rumors and lies are being said but no worries god is with me and my brother @ynw.bortlen and we want y'all to remember it’s a ynw Family I love you @ynwsakchaser1 and @ynwjuvy #freeus

Prior to his incarceration, songs such as “Murder on My Mind” and “Mind on My Murder” had gained traction making their way in the Billboard Hot 100 and gaining RIAA certifications in a matter of months. Speculations made people believe that the songs were related to the murders, however, they were soon put to rest due to the time of the recordings being almost two years prior to the shootings.

After spending months incarcerated, on November 22, 2019, he released his debut studio album, Melly vs. Melvin featuring his 9lokkNine-assisted “223’s”.

After the rise of COVID-19 disease in 2020, on April 3, Melly had tested positive for the virus while awaiting trial. After being infected, Melly’s lawyers tried to play this to his advantage and requested a medical release as conditions can worsen in the jail environment. Melly was denied release on April 17 and conditions have been said to worsen since.

After the release of fellow Floridian rapper Kodak Black, Melly’s team had taken advantage and released “Thugged Out” to keep Melly’s name alive in the industry. They carried on releasing singles throughout the year with artists such as Queen Naija and Hotboii.

Again, while still awaiting trial, on August 13, 2021, he released his sophomore studio album, Just A Matter of Slime, featuring his highly anticipated Lil Uzi Vert-assisted “Mind of Melvin”.

After prosecutors had claimed they had a confession of Melly admitting to the murders, on November 1, Melly’s lawyers came out and denied the claims and said that Melly was just rapping a song titled “4:30 AM” by Kevin Gates. Soon after, on November 30, Melly’s trial had been set for March 7, 2022. - TippleTripple123 <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/YNW+Melly"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In fashion design, he has collaborated with Nike, Inc., Louis Vuitton, and Gap Inc. on clothing and footwear, and led the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas.

One of the world's best-selling music artists with 160 million records sold, West has won 24 Grammy Awards, the joint 11th-most of all time and the most awarded for any hip hop artist along with Jay-Z. His other accolades include a Billboard Artist Achievement Award, a joint-record three Brit Awards for Best International Male Solo Artist, and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. West holds the joint record with Bob Dylan for most albums (four) topping the annual Pazz & Jop critic poll. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015. West's first six solo albums were included on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2020, with the same publication naming him one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.

West's outspoken views have received significant media coverage. He has been a frequent source of controversy due to his conduct on social media, at award shows, and in public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, race, and slavery. His Christian faith, high-profile marriage to Kim Kardashian, and mental health have also been topics of media attention. In 2020, West launched an unsuccessful independent presidential campaign that advocated for a consistent life ethic. In October 2022, he was widely condemned and lost many sponsors and partnerships, including his collaborations with Adidas, Gap, and Balenciaga, after making a series of antisemitic statements, including denying the Holocaust. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

57,57,drake,5936355,835016675,"Aubrey ""Drake"" Graham (born October 24, 1986) is an Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and businessman. Drake was an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s. Intent on pursuing a career in music, he left the series in 2007 after releasing his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.

Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum. His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same, were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late and collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of which earned platinum certification in the U.S. His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records. The dancehall-influenced album sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over 10 years. The album's second single, ""One Dance"", topped the charts in several countries, and became his first number-one single as a lead artist. That year, Drake led both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts simultaneously for eight weeks.

Views achieved quadruple platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. It became Drake's best-selling album to date. Its lead single ""Hotline Bling"" peaked at number two on the Hot 100 and received Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song, as well as ""One Dance"" which was proclaimed the song of the summer in 2016. In 2017, he released the ""playlist"" More Life. It became his seventh consecutive number one on the Billboard 200, and set multiple streaming records. A year later, he released the double album Scorpion, which also broke several streaming records, and contains the Grammy Award winning number-one single ""God's Plan"", and the bounce-infused number one singles ""Nice for What"" and ""In My Feelings"".

Among the world's best-selling music artists, with over 170 million records sold worldwide, he is ranked by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) as the world's highest-certified digital singles artist. Drake holds several Billboard chart records. He has the most charted songs (205) among solo artists in the history of the Billboard Hot 100, the most simultaneously charted Hot 100 songs in a single week (27), the most time on the Hot 100 (431 weeks) and the most Hot 100 debuts in a week (22). He also has the most number one singles on the Hot Rap Songs, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay and Rhythmic Charts. Drake has also won four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, twenty-seven Billboard Music Awards and three Juno Awards. As an entrepreneur, Drake has founded the OVO Sound record label with longtime collaborator 40 in 2012.

Early life
Drake attended both Forest Hill Collegiate Institute (left) and Vaughan Road Academy (right) during high school.
Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practicing Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Drake's mother, Sandra ""Sandi"" Graham (née Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. His parents met after Dennis performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he first interacted with Sandra, who was in attendance. He is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day school, and formally celebrated becoming a Bar Mitzvah in a religious service.

Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Dennis' limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the United States until Drake's early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, however, Dennis would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer. His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song titled ""Drake's Dad"". Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell records, which Drake vehemently denies.

Drake was raised in two Toronto neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end until grade six, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighborhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move, Drake replied, ""[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement; my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.""

He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school. He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighborhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighborhood, Drake described the school as ""not by any means the easiest school to go to."" Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background, and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school. He later graduated in October 2012.

Career - 2001–2005: Degrassi: The Next Generation
At 15, eager to begin as an actor, a high school friend introduced Drake to his father, who was an acting agent. The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks a basketball star who became physically disabled after a classmate shot him. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, ""My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV"". He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, returning for sporadic appearances until his character graduated from school. Overall, Drake appeared in a total of 145 episodes.

2006–2009: Early mixtapes and So Far Gone
Lil Wayne, the founder of Young Money Entertainment, would sign Drake to the label in 2009.
After becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as ""pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it."" The mixtape was released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies. In 2007, he released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single ""Replacement Girl"", featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever-unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with ""Replacement Girl"" being featured on the channel's ""New Joint of the Day"" segment on April 30, 2007. The song also saw Drake sample ""Man of the Year"" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including ""Ransom"", ""Forever"", and a remix to ""Brand New"". Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.

In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles ""Best I Ever Had"" and ""Successful"", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs ""I'm Goin' In"" and ""Fear"". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.

Due to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as ""one of the biggest bidding wars ever"". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album titled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means.

Drake then joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of ""Best I Ever Had"" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He underwent surgery later that year.

2010–2012: Thank Me Later and Take Care
Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.

On March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single ""Over"", which peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, ""Find Your Love"", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[76] The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, ""]Care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image]."" The third single and fourth singles, ""Miss Me"" and ""Fancy"" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.

Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.

It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire on May 8, and he had also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.

Beginning his second effort in fall 2010, Drake announced his intentions to allow for Noah ""40"" Shebib to handle most of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me Later, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and others. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be Take Care. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, ""I didn't get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed many of the songs and sonically I didn't get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round."" Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.

In January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie, to focus on the album. ""Dreams Money Can Buy"" and ""Marvins Room"" were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track listing, while ""Marvins Room"" gained Gold certification by the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio. Drake would soon release the song's music video on June 28.

""Headlines"" was released on August 9, acting as the lead single for Take Care. It was met with positive critical and commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12. It was eventually certified Platinum in both the United States and Canada. The music video for the single was released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game in January 2012. ""Make Me Proud"" was released as the album's second single, on October 16. It was the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number nine the following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88. ""Make Me Proud"" soon became Drake's fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.

Prior to the album's release, Drake had planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne, however, it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne. He had also begun collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled Y.O.L.O., but the duo decided against the project, in favor of increased concern for their respective studio albums.

Take Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. John McDonnell of NME dubbed it ""an affecting masterpiece"" and commended its ""delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive lyrics."" Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal found Drake's ""technical abilities"" to be improved and stated, ""Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up."" Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice called it ""a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West."" Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented the depth of Drake's ""moral psychodramas"" and stated, ""the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying power."" It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial success, eventually being certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the US.

The album's third and fourth singles, ""The Motto"" and Take Care"", were released on November 29, and February 21, 2012 respectively. Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with ""The Motto"" credited for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States. The music video for ""Take Care"" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, ""None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] - make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it."" The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year. The song was also featured on the channel's ""Pop Songs You Must Hear"" list of 2011. ""HYFR"" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified Gold. It would later win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video in 2012, and the channel also ranked him at number two on their ""Hottest MCs in the Game"" list.

In promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip-hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million. He then returned to acting, starring in Ice Age: Continental Drift as Ethan.

2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and commercial mixtapes
During the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer's influence over his next album. Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics prevalent previously.

In January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off of his third album at the conclusion of the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of his third album. The album's second single, ""Hold On, We're Going Home"", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful single off of the album, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song's music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the video. Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing the album's third single, ""Too Much"", alongside featured artist Sampha.

Nothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favorable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in 808s & Heartbreak. The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further promoted by the ""Would You like a Tour?"" throughout late 2013, to early 2014. It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million. Drake then returned to acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night Live, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what ""kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters"". Drake also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city. In late 2014, Drake announced that he had begun recording sessions for his fourth studio album.

In 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the Romeo Santos song Odio. He also appeared on a remix of Tuesday by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard's Rhythmic chart and number twelve on the ""Hot 100"", and released ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"" as a non-album single. The latter went double platinum in the United States.

On February 12, 2015, Drake released If You're Reading This It's Too Late onto iTunes, with no prior announcement. Despite debate on whether it is an album or a mixtape, its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money Records, a scheme that was rumored to allow Drake to leave the label. However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and If You're Reading This It's Too Late sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall. Drake proceeded If You're Reading This It's Too Late with a collaborative mixtape with Future, which was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week.

What a Time to Be Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Drake the first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the same year since 2004. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units. Drake also appeared on the cover of The Fader for their 100th issue.

2016–2017: Views and More Life
Drake announced in January 2016 that his fourth studio album would be launched during the spring, releasing the promotional single ""Summer Sixteen"" later that month. The album was originally titled Views from the six, but would later be shortened to Views. ""Summer Sixteen"" debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip-hop to more tenured artists. This move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as ""goodly brash"" or ""conventionally disrespectful."" It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake popularizing the term ""The Six"" when referencing Toronto. Drake also crashed a Bat Mitzvah in New York City on February 20, performing at the event.

Drake soon released the album's lead singles, ""Pop Style"" and the dancehall-infused ""One Dance"", on April 5. Both debuted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with ""One Dance"" becoming Drake's first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist. The single also became Drake's first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed the album's release date of April 29, and followed it up with various promotional videos. On October 15, ""One Dance"" became Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016.

Views was previewed in London, before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being made available to various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later to release a short film titled Please Forgive Me, starring frequent collaborators, Swedish twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta. As of 2019, Views remains Drake's best-selling album.

Drake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as the show's musical guest. Later, Drake was named as a member of the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury. During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the music video for ""Child's Play"" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics. On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views. At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Drake received the most nominations, with 10, winning the awards for Album of the Year and Best Hip-Hop Video. Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the course of the tour in Europe. Seven additional dates were added a day later due to overwhelming demands.

Soon after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed he would be releasing a project titled More Life in December, however he later pushed the date back to the new year. The project was described as a ""playlist of original music"", rather than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album. He was later revealed to be Spotify's most streamed artist for the second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion streams for all projects on the service, which is more than double the amount of streams he had in 2015. Drake later secured his second and third Grammy Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony. Despite multiple setbacks, Drake announced More Life would be released on March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials released through Instagram. Upon release, More Life received mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200, earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It also set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever streamed album in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music alone. The album also garnered 61.3 million streams on Spotify, dethroning Ed Sheeran's ÷ as the highest opening on the service in a single day. He later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins in a single show. Billboard also reported Drake had been present on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has the most recorded entries by a solo artist.

He then released the single ""Signs"" on June 24, as well as reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset. The singles marked his first releases since More Life, with ""Signs"" was initially released as a collaboration between Drake and French fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the ""Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2018"" fashion show. The event also had a playlist exclusively from OVO Sound, curated by label co-founder Oliver El-Khatib. Drake later hosted the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of Virginia Black. Drake then appeared in The Carter Effect documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince Carter, who was the first superstar player to appear for the Toronto Raptors since the franchise's inception in 1995. The documentary also featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and LeBron James.

2018: Scorpion and return to television
After rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer Pi'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017. Two songs would later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on January 20, 2018, marking Drake's first solo release since More Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring on a remix of the Jay-Z song ""Family Feud"" with Lil Wayne, as the lead single of the latter's Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape. Scary Hours featured the songs ""Diplomatic Immunity"" and ""God's Plan"", which both debuted within the top-ten, with the latter eventually breaking various streaming records as it debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was Drake's second as a solo artist to reach number one.

Drake earned his 70th top 40 hit after featuring on the Migos song ""Walk It Talk It"", which debuted at number eighteen, and peaked at number ten. He later featured on BlocBoy JB's debut single, ""Look Alive"", which was released on February 9, 2018. The song's entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper with the top 10 hits on the Hot 100, with 23. He then featured on a remix to ""Lemon"", a song originally released as collaboration between band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, Drake announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was releasing a single later that night. On April 6, ""Nice for What"" was released, alongside a music video, which featured several female celebrities.

After ""Nice For What"" replaced his own ""God's Plan"" on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace their former number-one debut, Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion, with a planned release date of June 29, 2018. He then released ""I'm Upset"" on May 26, as the album's third single. Scorpion was then released as a double-album, and marked Drake's longest project, with a run-time of just under 90 minutes. The album broke both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it gained 132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming service, respectively. It eventually sold 749,000 album equivalent units in its first week of sales, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.

Shortly thereafter, Drake collaborated with British hip hop promotion Link Up TV on July 7, releasing a freestyle as a part of the promotion's 'Behind Barz' segment, before releasing another freestyle a week later after featuring on Charlie Sloth's long-running Fire in the Booth program on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Drake then earned his sixth number-one hit with ""In My Feelings"" on July 21, which also spawned the viral ""#InMyFeelingsChallenge"" or ""#KiKiChallenge"". The success of ""In My Feelings"" also made Drake the record holder for most number one hits among rappers. Soon after, he released the music video for ""Nonstop"", which was filmed in London during his surprise performance at the Wireless Festival.

He then appeared on the album Astroworld, featuring uncredited vocals for the song ""Sicko Mode"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Drake announced in July 2018 that he planned to ""take 6 months to a year"" to himself in order to produce television and films, including Euphoria. He then began the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour with co-headliners Migos on August 12. This preceded collaboration with Bad Bunny titled ""Mia"", which featured Drake performing in Spanish. He later received the award for Hot Ticket Performer at the 2018 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 16. During a performance in Edmonton on November 7, Drake announced his intention to begin composing his next project in early 2019.

2019–present: Upcoming album
In February 2019, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rap Song, for ""God's Plan"", at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. During his speech, producers abruptly cut to a commercial break, leading viewers to speculate they were censoring his speech during which he criticized The Recording Academy. A legal representative for the Academy then released a statement stating ""a natural pause [led] the producers [to] assume that he was done and cut to commercial,"" and added the organization offered him an opportunity to return to stage, but he declined.

On February 14, Drake re-released his third mixtape, So Far Gone, onto streaming services for the first time to commemorate its 10-year anniversary, and later collaborated with Summer Walker on a remix of Walker's song ""Girls Need Love"", marking his first release of 2019. On April 10, 2019 during a London performance on his Assassination Vacation Tour, the OVO leader told the crowd he was working on his new album before the show. On June 8, Drake appeared on Chris Brown's single ""No Guidance"". On June 15, Drake released two songs, ""Omertà"" and ""Money in the Grave"", on his EP The Best in the World Pack to celebrate the NBA Championship win of the Toronto Raptors. On August 2, he released the compilation album Care Package, consisting of songs released between 2010 and 2016 that were initially unavailable for purchase or commercial streaming; it debuted at number one.

Artistry - influences
Drake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West, Jay Z, and Lil Wayne, while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah, and Usher. Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his ""biggest inspirations"".

Musical style
Drake has credited Kanye West (left) and Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical influences. Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism. His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as ""ting"", ""touching road"", ""talkin' boasy"" and ""gwanin' wassy"". Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip-hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing. He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.

The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional or boastful. However, Drake is often revered for incorporating ""degrading"" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between ""pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata."" Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as ""hyper-reality rap"", which is characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as being distinct from the ""real world.""

Public image
The Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States, with his single, ""The Motto"", which includes, ""You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO."" Drake later popularized the term ""The Six"" in 2015 in relation his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city. Furthermore, the subject matter of his artistry often revolving around relationships, have had widespread impact on social media through photo captions commonly used to reference emotions or personal situations. However, his lyrical contents have had a negative reception from fans and critics deeming him as sensitive; a trait that is understood as being antithetical to hip hop culture. June 10 was declared ""Drake Day"" in Houston, Texas. In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines, in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance. In 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States. He would also donate $200,000 in order to aid relief efforts in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey. In February 2018, following the single ""God's Plan"" debut at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Drake donated $50,000 to a Miami homeless shelter and giving a University of Miami student $50,000 to help with her tuition. Drake then ""kept up the spending spree"" by donating the rest of the song's video budget, $996,631.90, to several charitable causes and regular people across Miami.

The music video for ""Hotline Bling"" went viral, due to Drake's eccentric choices in dancing. The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake's unconventional nature on the song, causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, spawning several parodies. Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exampled by the video for ""Hotline Bling"". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6"" Classic Boots. This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose, in which various items of clothing were produced. Drake had also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the ""Air Jordan OVOs"". Moreover, his style and dress sense have caused GQ magazine to describe him as ""[one of] the most stylish men alive"".

Controversies - legal issues
In 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on ""Marvins Room"". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties. Despite Drake's legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling ""Jimmy Smith Rap"", a 1982 single by jazz musician, Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who stated Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on ""Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2"", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop. Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement. Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics on when collaborating with YG on the song ""Who Do You Love?"". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year. In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.

In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel ""Chubbs"" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also says the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering. The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu, after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference; the judge ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense.

Feuds
Drake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident and released a song criticizing Drake weeks later. Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute.

In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe magazine. Drake would later respond on ""6 God"" and ""6PM in New York"", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment.

Further controversy arose in July 2015, when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during recording sessions for ""RICO"", one of the lead singles off of Mill's second studio album. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller. Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for ""R.I.C.O."". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for ""R.I.C.O."", ""10 Bands"", and ""Know Yourself"". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, titled ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back"", in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with ""Wanna Know"", before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later. Despite subliminal disses from either artist, the feud has not been officially reignited. Drake would further seek to denounce Funkmaster Flex during his Madison Square Garden shows on the Summer Sixteen Tour. Following Meek Mill's sentencing of two to four years for probation violation, Drake stated ""Free Meek Mill"" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on ""Family Feud"". Pusha T would also use the same rationale to criticize Drake on ""Infrared"" in 2018, prompting Drake to respond with the ""Duppy Freestyle"" diss track on May 25. Pusha T would directly respond to the track through ""The Story of Adidon"" on May 29, which presented several claims, including an accusation of Drake fathering a secret child. The pair is considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, with Drake yet to respond to ""The Story of Adidon"".

In 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through ""4PM in Calabasas"", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on ""No Shopping"" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song. However, French Montana claimed that Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake, he has yet to officially respond to Budden. In the same year, Drake mocked Kid Cudi for his mental health, drug use and suicidal urges on ""Two Birds, One Stone"" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter. Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.

In mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator, Kanye West. In an appearance on the talk show The Shop in October, Drake recounted several business meetings with West, who voiced his desire to ""be Quincy Jones"" and work with him, in order to replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson. West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, which was agreed to as Drake ""felt a genuine vibe"" from West, and after West gifted him the beat to ""Lift Yourself"", which inspired Drake to begin writing to the instrumental. West then requested Drake to travel to Wyoming to continue working, and arrived a day after close friend 40. 40 said West was working on an album; contradictory to his previous aim of just wanting to ""give [Drake] beats"". Drake responded by saying West stated he would release in late 2018, and they should continue on. However, upon his arrival in Wyoming, Drake ""[spent] the majority of time working on [West's] music"", only exploring his own after playing the producer the song ""March 14"", which addresses Drake's relationship with his newborn son and co-parent. This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T. West would also release ""Lift Yourself"", and produce ""Infrared""; actions that greatly displeased Drake. This prompted him to denounce West in several songs and live performances. West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018.

Drake has purported to have been in reported feuds with DMX, Kendrick Lamar, Common, The Weeknd, XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez, and Ludacris, although the latter three have been reported to be resolved.

Business ventures - Endorsements
Prior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient. In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger King and Whataburger. Business magazine Forbes commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships ""combined heavily"" for Drake's reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the highest-paid celebrities during that period.

Main article: OVO Sound
During the composition of Nothing Was the Same, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, and business partner, Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the trio to team up to form OVO Sound. The name is an abbreviation derived from the October's Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects. Warner Bros. Records currently distribute the label.

Drake, 40 and PartyNextDoor were the label's inaugural artists. The label houses artists including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, OB O'Brien, Roy Woods, dvsn, Plaza, and Kash Doll, as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Mike Zombie, Nineteen85, and Future the Prince. OVO Sound has released six albums, with two certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Toronto Raptors
On September 30, 2013, at a press conference with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke, Drake was announced as the new ""global ambassador"" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. This would also be the setting where Drake was given The Key to the City. In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities, beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary. He began by hosting an annual ""Drake Night"" segment with the organization, which began in 2013.

Apple Music
Following the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million. This saw all future solo releases by Drake becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers. Drake had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted More Life. Drake's partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform's sharp success, as it attained 10 million subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists, such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services. Through signing with the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before the smartwatch saw public release.

Virginia Black
Two months prior to the release of Views, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based whiskey. This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring's Restaurant in Toronto. The beverage was created and also distributed alongside Proximo Spirits, as well as with Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008. The company described the partnership as ""fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey.""

The product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically. The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music and various tours, such as being part of the ""Virginia Black VIP Lounge"" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016. The company later aired commercials with Dennis Graham, which featured the tagline of ""The Realest Dude Ever"" (in reference toward ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to various European countries in 2017.

Personal life
Drake lives in Hidden Hills, California, since 2012. He also owns a property in Toronto, which was built from the ground-up in 2017, and a Toronto condo adjacent to the CN Tower. He owns a Boeing 767 airplane.

Drake's paternal uncles are bass guitarist Larry Graham and musician Teenie Hodges. Graham achieved both critical and commercial success as a member of the band Sly and the Family Stone, while Hodges featured as the lead guitarist and songwriter for Al Green, and contributed heavily on much of his work in the 1970s, including the hits ""Take Me to the River"", ""Love and Happiness"", and ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"".

Drake is a father to one son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French artist Sophie Brussaux. Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumors after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017; Drake eventually confirmed his fatherhood on the album Scorpion in 2018.

Drake dated singer Rihanna off-and-on from 2009 to 2016. He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums, and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said ""she's a woman I've been in love with since I was 22 years old."" On becoming a single parent, he mused on the talk show The Shop:

As life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don't have the fairy tale, like, 'Oh, Drake started a family with Rihanna and this is like so perfect.' It looks so good on paper. By the way, I wanted that too at one time.

Other artists
There are several other artists that have performed under the name Drake:
1) heavy metal act
2) Jason Drake
3) 60s garage rock
4) Polish sea folk band

58,58,nf,1067520,75146131,"NF is the stage name of rapper and composer Nate Feuerstein from Gladwin, Michigan. Feuerstein endured a hardship-filled childhood in which his parents divorced, his mother's boyfriend physically abused him, and his mother eventually killed herself. Music was his escape, and he began recording songs on a karaoke machine, with instrumentals on one microphone and his raps in the other. Placing second in a nationwide Fine Arts Festival rap competition in 2008, and first in Michigan the following year, he independently released a debut album, Moments, in 2010. The album attracted the attention of Xist Music, which signed him to a recording deal in 2012, by which time Feuerstein had taken on the stage name NF. The label announced the release of an EP that same year, but it never appeared, and NF and Xist parted ways. NF spent the next two years looking for a label and working with local producer Tommee Profitt in his studio; they came up with the song ""Wake Up,"" which convinced Capitol Christian Music Group to sign him. CMG released a six-song (including a Manny Marroquin remix of ""Wake Up"") self-titled EP late in the summer of 2014. His debut album, Mansion, was released in early 2015 and reached number 62 on the Billboard 200 while topping the Christian Albums chart. The aptly titled Therapy Session followed in 2016 and also topped the Christian Albums chart with its raw emotions and honest lyrics. The following Summer saw the release of the singles ""Outro"" and ""Green Lights"", in anticipation of the arrival of his third studio long player, Perception, which dropped later that October. NF achieved mainstream popularity in 2017 with Perception; the album charted at number one in the United States and was certified platinum, while its third single, ""Let You Down"", reached number twelve on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was a top-ten hit internationally. He achieved similar commercial success with his follow-up The Search (2019). Feuerstein's most recent album, Hope, released on April 7, 2023, had commercial success and peaked at number 2 on the US Billboard 200. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/NF"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

59,59,young thug,1515445,137563629,"Jeffery Lamar Williams, better known by his stage name Young Thug (acronym for Truly Humble Under God, also uses the name ""SEX!!"" and was briefly known as ""Jeffery""), is an American rapper from Atlanta, Georgia who is signed to Gucci Mane's 1017 Brick Squad Records, Asylum Records and Atlantic Records. Thug grew to prominence in 2013 after releasing his mixtape 1017 Thug to positive critical reception. He has collaborated with artists such as Gucci Mane, Young Scooter, Rich Homie Quan and Waka Flocka Flame.

Thug was born amongst the masses eliminating any doubt that he wouldn’t be special. The second youngest child of 11 children developed a skill for standing out amongst many, early. Young Thug moved to Jonesboro, an impoverished suburb of Georgia where his lifestyle was engrossed by the crime, drug addiction and violence that surrounded him. It was there that he developed an insatiable appetite to succeed his current situation. After discovering and acknowledging his talent and creativity for music in  2010, Thug started a new hustle that would soon mature as one of the most promising music careers in the South. He also founded the record label YSL ( Young Stoner/Slatt Life) in 2010.


Eyeballing the throne of Hip hop royalty, Young Thug began to create a sound and style that would inevitably place him on top. Young Thug’s catchy verses and raw lyrical talent distinguished noise from art, clearly being the latter his creations are the best that remain of Southern hip hop. He is the embodiment of the evolution of Southern hip-hop. Young Thug is the representative for a generation that doesn't see hip-hop as a hobby but a lifestyle. Keeping true to himself, his art, and his home Young Thug will stand alone as the one true savior of the Southern movement. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Young+Thug"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

60,60,cano,22335,485373,"CANO is a Franco-Ontarian folk-pop collective which was active from 1975 until 1985. While Wikipedia claims that CANO was ""progressive"", the band itself describes its style as a mix of folk, rock, and jazz (see www.canomusique.com).

The name comes from the Coopérative des artistes du Nouvel Ontario (CANO), an agricultural and artistic commune established in Sudbury, Ontario.

On stage, CANO was able to produce a level of intensity only comparable to a symphonic orchestra. They did not only produce the most European music in America in their era (which may have hurt their success chances in the U.S.), they did so while bridging the tremendous cultural gap between French and English Canada by including members from both parts and singing in both languages.

Members of the band are singer André Paiement (died in 1978), violinist Wasyl Kohut (died in 1981), guitarists Marcel Aymar and David Burt, bassist John Doerr, pianist Michel Kendel, and drummer Michel Dasti.

61,61,polo g,1021548,87704124,"Taurus Tremani Bartlett (born January 6, 1999), known professionally as Polo G, is an American rapper from Chicago, Illinois. He is best known for his song with Bronx rapper, Lil Tjay, ""Pop Out"", which has amassed over 80 million views on YouTube and peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Polo G was originally known for his Chicago drill sound, but eventually transitioned to a more melodic style. He has been noted for his ""vivid and explicit storytelling""; his lyrics often involve tough subjects, including racism and mental health. He also regularly pays homage to his hometown, and, as noted by Ayana Rashed of Respect, ""he is also quick to acknowledge the common injustice and frequent police brutality he and so many others face on the daily"". He has stated that American rapper Lil Wayne and hip-hop icon Tupac Shakur are his biggest influences. He also grew up listening to Gucci Mane, as well as Chicago rappers Lil Durk, G Herbo and Chief Keef.

Bartlett was born in the Old Town area of Chicago. He was raised by both of his parents and grew up with three siblings in a small project development known as Marshall Field Garden Apartments. Before his rise to fame, Bartlett spent multiple stints in prison. Bartlett's first song ever recorded was titled ""ODA"". Upon creating a SoundCloud account in 2018, he released the track ""Gang With Me"", which quickly racked up millions of plays. He continued gaining traction with his songs ""Welcome Back"" and ""Neva Cared"". Bartlett went on to release ""Finer Things"", a song he wrote while incarcerated, in the latter half of 2018 and quickly gained millions of views. In early 2019, Bartlett released ""Pop Out"" featuring Lil Tjay which peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song's music video gained over 200 million views on YouTube and led to him signing a record deal with Columbia Records. Bartlett also released videos for his songs ""Deep Wounds"", ""Through Da Storm"", ""Effortless"", and ""Dyin' Breed"" from his critically acclaimed debut studio album Die a Legend, which was released on June 7, 2019, and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard 200. ""Heartless"", a single released later in 2019, featured production from Mustard, and was later featured on his second album.

On February 14, 2020, Polo G released the track ""Go Stupid"", with rappers Stunna 4 Vegas and NLE Choppa. The song also featured production from Mike Will Made-It and Tay Keith. ""Go Stupid"" became his second song on the Hot 100 (after ""Pop Out""), peaking at number 60 on the Hot 100, number 29 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, and number 20 on Hot Rap Songs.

63,63,nle choppa,1172149,43803076,"Memphis teen rap sensation NLE Choppa has seen his circumstances change with the swiftness. He began freestyling with his friends at 14, started taking it seriously at age 15 and had millions of views and major-label interest shortly after his 16th birthday. He first got his buzz from ""No Chorus Pt. 3,"" a song and video from his crew Shotta Fam on which Choppa kicks off the song off and steals the show.
Since it's release in early January, NLE Choppa's ""Shotta Flow"" video has amassed more than 12 million views in nearly six weeks. The visual for his breakout record shows a precocious youth who is just as adept at dancing as he is at swinging choppas.

His flows and stylistic choices recall his friend and fellow hometown rapper BlocBoy JB. Yet Choppa is unique. His intensity, voice and dark sense of humor set him apart from the fray. His follow-up record, ""Shotta Flow 2,"" is approaching 2 million views in under a week.

Always business-savvy, Choppa turned down a $3 million dollar deal and opted for a partnership with UnitedMasters, a company that distributes his music while allowing him to keep his masters. With an EP coming in the spring and more videos on the way, the young artist's name is everywhere, even catching the attention of legendary rap mogul Birdman, who he's been spotted sharing studio time with. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/NLE+Choppa"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His music is known for the lofi sound quality of his vocals and songs, which normally are distorted and unmastered. His vocal style ranged from singing, rapping, and screaming.

Onfroy's most popular song to-date is Look at Me, which was originally released in 2016 and re-released in 2017, and peaked at number 42 on US Billboard Hot 100. The single helped him gain more popularity in early 2017 due to accusations of Canadian rapper Drake using a similar rap flow in his then unreleased song, now released under the name ""KMT"", that he previewed at a concert in Amsterdam featuring British rapper Giggs.

In July 2016, Onfroy was arrested and charged with robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. After posting bail in early October of the same year, while awaiting trial, Onfroy was arrested again later that month on charges of false imprisonment, witness tampering, and aggravated battery of a pregnant victim.

71,71,will smith,1624940,15660730,"Willard Christopher Smith II (born September 25, 1968) is an American Oscar winning actor and a multiple Grammy winning hip hop artist. He is one of few people who have enjoyed legitimate success in the three major entertainment media in the United States: film, television, and the music industry.

Will Smith was born and raised in West Philadelphia. He spent most of his days in a playground, training basketball and relaxing all cool. Career-wise, he started as the vocalist of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, with his childhood friend Jeffrey ""DJ Jazzy Jeff"" Townes as turntablist and producer. The duo was known for performing humorous, radio-friendly songs, most notably ""Parents Just Don't Understand"" and ""Summertime."" They gained critical acclaim for winning the first ever Grammy in the Rap category (1988).

Smith was a charismatic and energetic performer but he was nearing bankruptcy when in 1990, the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him. The show was successful and helped revitalize his career

Although he made a notable dramatic film debut in Six Degrees of Separation (in which he played totally against type as a gay con man) while still appearing in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Smith's film career took off with his role in Bad Boys (1995) along with co-star Martin Lawrence.

After The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air ended in 1996, Smith began a successful solo music career while simultaneously starring in a series of films. The first two films were hugely successful summer blockbusters: Independence Day (1996), in which he played a fearless and confident fighter pilot, and Men in Black (1997), where he played the comic and confident Agent J against Tommy Lee Jones's deadpan Agent K. Smith's acting in Men in Black won critical praise. The two films established Smith's commercial reputation as a bankable star whose appeal across age, race, and gender lines could ""open"" a film at the box office. Because his movies usually open during the July 4th weekend, many people have come to call a July 4th weekend in which Will Smith stars in a movie ""Big Willie Weekend.""

Lead roles in Enemy of the State, Wild Wild West, Ali, Men in Black II Bad Boys II and ""I, Robot"" then followed. He also starred in 2005's Hitch. (Like Smith, Hitch co-star Kevin James starred in a sitcom named for royalty, The King of Queens.) His 2006 role is that of Chris Gardner in the ""inspired by a true story"", ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" was nominated for, ""Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role"" an Oscar in 2007. Smith's son Jaden also stars in the movie.(Jaden Smith as of 2010 lately played the lead role of Dre Parker in the 2010 remake of ""The Karate Kid"".) Will Smith's latest acting role was ""Seven Pounds"" in 2008 where he played Ben Thomas an IRS agent. Since then he's been producing movies that include, ""The Karate Kid""(2010), ""The Human Contract""(2009), and ""Lakeview Terrace""(2008)
 
Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the boxer Muhammad Ali in Ali.

Smith also released a string of hit singles, often associated with his most recent film, throughout the late 1990s. The most notable of these were his #1 hit theme song ""Men in Black,"" the #1 hit ""Gettin' Jiggy Wit It"" (which made jiggy a catchphrase for a while in 1998), and ""Just the Two of Us,"" an affecting message to his young son. His first two solo albums went platinum, but his third, on Columbia Records, was a sales disappointment compared to his past efforts, and after a quick Greatest Hits release that was almost not advertised at all, he was dropped by the label. He signed a recording contract with Interscope Records and released the successful Lost and Found in 2005. The album was propelled solely on the smash hit single, ""Switch,"" which appealed to the mainstream media ala ""Summertime."" The single stayed atop the charts for months and returned Smith to the forefront of Hip Hop.

Also, on February 6, 2005 he appeared in the Super Bowl XXX.

On July 2, 2005, Smith served as host for the Live 8 concert in his native Philadelphia before an enormous crowd, and later performed a set with DJ Jazzy Jeff.

Smith married actress Sharee Zampino in 1992. They had a son, Willard Christopher III, also known as ""Trey"", but divorced in 1995. Smith married actress Jada Pinkett in 1997. Together they have two children: Jaden Christopher Syre (born 1998) and Willow Camille Reign (born 2000). Along with his brother, Harry Smith, he owns Treyball Development Inc., a Beverly Hills-based company named after his first son. He has been consistently listed in Fortune Magazine's ""Richest 40"" list of the forty wealthiest Americans under the age of 40.

Will Smith has been criticized for his lip service to his home town of Philadelphia, PA. Several of his songs talk about parts of Philadelphia and the surrounding areas. While he has spoken over the years about how much he loves the city and how much he wants to give back, none of his proposed ventures in the city of Philadelphia have ever been developed. He has proposed opening a restaurant, several upscale bars, and a community center in Philadelphia which have never seen development. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Will+Smith"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

72,72,falling in reverse,1066786,48931919,"Falling in Reverse is an American rock band based in Las Vegas, Nevada and formed in 2008, signed to Epitaph Records. The band is led currently by vocalist Ronnie Radke alongside bassist Tyler Burgess, lead guitarist Max Georgiev and drummer Luke Holland. 

In 2008, lead singer Ronnie Radke was involved in an altercation in Las Vegas that resulted in the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Cook. While Radke did not shoot Cook, he was indicted on battery charges. These charges, combined with Radke's past troubles with narcotics and rehab, led to a suspended sentence and five years probation. After he failed to report to his probation officer he was arrested in June 2008, where his probation was revoked and he was mandated to serve his original sentence of two years in prison. At the time, Ronnie Radke was the lead singer of post-hardcore band Escape the Fate, which in 2006, released its debut album, Dying Is Your Latest Fashion. Following Radke's incarceration, he was ejected from the band and replaced by former Blessthefall lead singer Craig Mabbitt. Max Green, bassist of Escape the Fate, stated about Radke's law problems that, ""First we couldn't tour out of the country, then out of the state."" Radke was released on December 12, 2010.

During his time in prison, Radke formed a new band called From Behind These Walls. He officially began creating media with the band upon his release, but was later forced to change its name to Falling in Reverse due to copyright infringement. In 2009, with Radke still in prison, he was able to launch a demo of his band, due to contacts with several musicians he had. The demo contains four songs that were not put on the debut album The Drug in Me Is You. The original lineup consisted of Radke and bassist Nason Schoeffler, who helped find guitarist Jacky Vincent and rhythm guitarist Derek Jones. The band went through several drummers. Nick Rich was later replaced by Oscar Garcia, Khaled Biersack, and former LoveHateHero member Scott Gee, as official members, before finding former the Bigger Lights drummer Ryan Seaman. Schoeffler quit the band in April 2011 and was replaced by Mika Horiuchi, formerly of the band Cellador, who also later departed from the band after issues with Radke.

In January 2010, the band began recording for the first time. The group announced on December 20 that it would go to Orlando, Florida to record a full-length debut album over a period of two months with a tentative release date of the first quarter of 2011. The band also confirmed that Radke's friend, Michael Baskette, who has worked on Blessthefall's album Witness and Radke on Escape the Fate's debut Dying Is Your Latest Fashion, would produce the album. It was soon confirmed that the band was signed with Epitaph Records, Radke's former label with Escape the Fate, and the band released its debut album in 2011. The album was soon titled The Drug in Me Is You and was slated for a July 26, 2011 release date, with pre-orders beginning on June 7. The eleven song track list was released soon after. With the help of Executive Producer Michael ""Elvis"" Baskette, mixing and tracking for the album concluded on April 2, 2011. The album spawned the singles ""Raised by Wolves"" and ""The Drug in Me Is You"". The band's first music video was released for ""The Drug in Me Is You"" on June 28, 2011. The Drug in Me Is You was released in the United States on July 26, 2011 to mostly mixed reviews, but managed to sell 18,000 copies in its first week in the US charting at number 19 on the Billboard 200. A third single, ""I'm Not a Vampire"", was released a few months after the album's release on October 24 with an accompanying music video.

The songs for the debut album were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. Lead vocalist Ronnie Radke has often called the album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, ""I would think all day, for days and days, about what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in different ways. I don't know why these kids love the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it.""

In January 2012, former I Am Ghost bassist Ron Ficarro began filling in as Falling in Reverse's The Drug in Me Is You Tour touring bassist due to the departure of former bassist Mika Horiuchi. Later on Ronnie announced on stage that Ron Ficarro was replacing Mika permanently.

Vocalist Ronnie Radke had been hinting on Twitter that the group had been working on the band's second album, with tweets such as ""You guys don't understand how many light years my next album is from the last one"". He and bandmate Ron Ficarro tweeted pictures of them in the studio with Ryan Ogren working on some new music. Ronnie had said a little bit about the new album to Marshal Music News. He said that, ""The last record was so vengeful and bitter and spiteful - so everyone is wondering what I'm gonna sing about next. And I'm just not quite ready to let people know. I'm sorry. When people hear the new stuff though I promise you they will lose their mind. It's light years ahead of my last album. We're demoing new songs right now, as we speak, and I'm telling you, people are seriously gonna lose their mind."" During the band's performance at Dirt Fest 2012 in Birch Run Michigan, Radke announced to the crowd that it would be the group's last show before returning to the studio for the band's second album. Ronnie also said in an interview that the band would be in the studio late 2012 with demos already and hoping for an early 2013 release.

On May 7 the band released the first single and music video, ""Alone"", from the second album, titled, Fashionably Late. The cover, merchandise, and a June 18, 2013 release date was revealed on May 7 as well.

On May 21, the title track, ""Fashionably Late"" was released as the second single. Later, on May 30, the song, ""Born to Lead"" was streamed through YouTube. The entire album was uploaded to Epitaph Records' YouTube channel on June 12, allowing fans to listen to the album before the official release date.

On October 28, 2013, Falling in Reverse, along with Ronnie's former band Escape the Fate, announced that they would be touring together, with Falling in Reverse headlining, on the Bury The Hatchet Tour. The bands posted a video through Alternative Press with Ronnie and Escape the Fate singer Craig Mabbit being interviewed about the tour, stating that the tour came about due to the groups' acceptances of each other. During the tour, Ronnie made appearances on stage with Escape the Fate, singing the singles from Escape the Fate debut album Dying Is Your Latest Fashion (""Situations"" and ""Not Good Enough for Truth in Cliché"").

In March 2014, Radke announced that the band had begun recording its third album. On May 12, 2014, it was announced by Alternative Press that Falling in Reverse had parted ways with bassist Ron Ficarro, reporting that former Escape the Fate bassist Max Green (who announced his departure from Escape the Fate just 3 days before on May 9, six months after rejoining Escape the Fate) would be his replacement. Ronnie is quoted as saying ""Ron was probably the best bass player I've ever played with, but at this moment in time I feel it is best to part ways with him. I respect him and wish nothing but the best for him. Max quitting Escape The Fate was like a godsend. It was a no brainer to have him join. I've known him half my life and this will be a great new chapter to start. ""

In an interview with MTV, Radke stated that the next album would be nothing like the single Alone from Fashionably Late as it has no raps throughout the album; he stated that it is heavier and will contain more screams, moving his passion for rapping into his solo career. Radke explained in another interview that the third album will be more like a ""sequel"" to the Escape the Fate album Dying Is Your Latest Fashion and is aimed to be nostalgic to people who were fans of the band since then.

On December 15, 2014, the first single from the band's third album, Just Like You, titled ""God, If You Are Above..."" was released.

On October 30, 2015, lead guitarist Jacky Vincent left the band on good terms before the band's fall tour with Attila, Metro Station and Assuming We Survive to focus on his solo career. On November 4, 2015, Christian Thompson confirmed himself as the new lead guitarist of the band. The video for the single Chemical Prisoner was released on January 27, 2016. The single performed moderately well on UK rock radio.

On January 6, 2016, the band members announced that they had begun work on their next album stating that it would be ""It's a huge left turn. It sounds like nothing we’ve ever done. Every song is very vibey, There's more feeling in it instead of a lot of metal."", further stating that ""We’re challenging ourselves now more than we ever have in the weirdest ways possible because you would think writing the craziest solo or riffs would be the challenging part. But the challenging part is trying to stick to a theme and not go all over the place like we would normally do."" On December 19, the band officially released the first single ""Coming Home"" from the untitled album. In January 2017, Radke began performing guitar for the band. On January 20, 2017, the band announced their next album Coming Home, which was released on April 7. Around the time of its release, it was rumoured that drummer Ryan Seaman parted ways with the band. This was confirmed when the band performed on May 8, without Seaman with Chris Kamrada playing drums as a touring member, who since left to play for Dashboard Confessional.

On February 23 2018, the band released a song called, Losing My Mind.

On April 16 2018, Christian officially announced via his Instagram page that his time with Falling In Reverse had come to an end. Though there was some controversy over the exact reason behind it, claims came from both sides that the departure was mutual but talk arose of irreconcilable differences and a decision was made to go separate ways. It has since been claimed that the split was due to differences between members causing an uneasy working environment.

On June 26, 2018, the band released a song called, Losing My Life along with a music video as a continuation of where the music video for Losing My Mind ended and featured a new line-up for the band which consists of Tyler Burgess on bass, Max Georgiev as lead guitarist, drummer Brandon ""Rage"" Richter, and Zakk Sandler on keyboards and rhythm guitar. The band also announced that they will be performing selected dates at the final year of the annual Vans Warped Tour with the new line up.

In April 2020, rhythm guitarist Derek Jones passed away. He was 35 years old. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Falling+in+Reverse"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

1) US indie pop 
2) Uruguay rap/trap 

1) James Cooley AKA Mesita is an American multi-instrumentalist from Colorado. He started releasing music under The Frustration Corporation, a plunderphonics project. He released his debut album under Mesita, Cherry Blossoms, in June 2008, with his debut EP No Worries coming out around a year later. In 2010, he released his second EP Living/Breathing. The EP changed his sound from indie rock to a more polished indietronica/pop sound. His second album Here's To Nowhere was released in March 2011, being supported by the single ""Somewhere Else/The New Age"". His third, The Coyote was released on April 3, 2012. In April 2013, he released XYXY, his 3rd EP. All of the songs from this EP were recycled onto his fourth album Future Proof, released on October 8, 2013. Mesita's album The Phoenix was released before New Year's Eve on December 30, 2014. It features the singles ""The Villain"" and ""Phoenix Deluxe"". In 2015, he released the single ""Be The Light"" which would be tagged onto his 4th EP Small Table as a bonus track in 2016, the title being a reference to the double meaning of his artist name. Only a few months after the February 2016 release of Small Table, he released ""With Love, From Laniakea"" which was supported by two singles, those being ""Montana"" & ""Blank Slate"".  His 5th EP ""Mall Music"" was released in 2017, supported by the singles ""Compliments"", ""Spiraling"", ""Intimacy"" & ""All Out in the Open"".
After his mother's passing, He would move away from Chicago, which he relocated to with the recording of Future Proof, to New York, and start work on Littleton, an album dedicated to her. The album would be his first to be made in a professional DAW, the DAW being used is Reason.  The song Sorting would be added onto Littleton shortly after release. Mesita would release his 6th EP ""Repackaged Trash"" in December 2018.
Sometime in 2019, he would become viral on X (Formerly Twitter) for doing short under 1-minute songs for people who asked. This led to the album ""You Are Beautiful"" in 2019, which consisted of longer versions of these styles of songs. This would eventually turn into a series in his discography, with ""You're Still Beautiful"", ""am i still beautiful"" and ""everyone is beautiful"".
After ""You Are Beautiful"", Mesita would release his 7th EP Blackwhite. All of the songs off of Blackwhite were released as singles before the release of the EP.
In 2019, Mesita would release their 7th Album Eat Ass or Die Trying. This album has been described by Mesita as his ""mental breakdown album"" Comparable to the ""Beautiful Series"", it features an almost spoken word type of singing/writing that feels like a conversation through song. In 2020, it would be reissued in a deluxe version with a second disc titled ""We Are All Going To Die""  His 9th album (counting We Are All Going to Die) ""Empty Island"" would release later in 2020. His 10th album and the spiritual successor to Eat Ass or Die Trying ""Life is Flashing Before My Eyes One Day At a Time"" would release in 2021.
After this album, Mesita's releases would become scarce, only dropping songs just to immediately delete them off of whatever platform it was uploaded to. Mesita has a history of wiping their discography from streaming and other services such as YouTube, leading to many songs/videos being lost, even to Mesita himself. His original YouTube account would be deleted at some point between 2019 - 2020, He now uploads under the Mesita Reuploads account. His 11th album is set to release in March 2024.

78,78,youngboy never broke again,839014,116626456,"Kentrell DeSean Gaulden (born October 20, 1999), better known by his stage name YoungBoy Never Broke Again (aka NBA YoungBoy), is a Baton Rouge, LA rapper.

YoungBoy started writing and making music around the age of fourteen, eventually dropping his first mixtape Life Before Fame in April of 2015.

YoungBoy started to gain recognition when he dropped his projects Mind Of A Menace 3, Before I Go, and 38 Baby, but gained the most recognition for his hit song “38 Baby.”

Shortly after the success of “38 Baby” Young Boy was arrested on November 28, 2016, and was charged with two counts of attempted second-degree murder in connection with a drive-by shooting which occurred November 7, 2016. YoungBoy ended up being sentenced to a ten-year suspended prison sentence after serving six months in prison.

After YoungBoy was released from jail, he dropped “Untouchable” which is one of his biggest hits to date. Following the release of “Untouchable,” YoungBoy released AI YoungBoy on August 4, 2017.

Later on, in 2017 YoungBoy ended the year by dropping Ain’t Too Long and started 2018 by releasing his debut studio album, Until Death Call My Name.

Nowadays YoungBoy has come up with more famous tracks such as “Drawing Symbols,” “Lil Top,” “House Arrest Tingz” and “Around”. These have appeared on albums as AI Youngboy II, Still Flexin', Still Steppin' and Top.

On March 25, 2021, the rapper was taken into custody by the FBI on an outstanding federal warrant for drug and weapon charges which date back to 2016. While locked up, YoungBoy’s team released the rapper’s third studio album, Sincerely, Kentrell, on September 24, 2021: it was originally set to be released in May of the same year. Nearly a month after, on October 22, YoungBoy was released from jail on a $500K bond and is currently placed on house arrest in Utah.

Ending 2021, YoungBoy partnered with the fellow Louisiana native, Birdman to present the two artists' joint mixtape, From The Bayou which would peak at #19 on the Billboard 200.

Beginning 2022 to a ferocious start, YoungBoy would begin to diss King Von on songs such as “Bring The Hook,” and “Fish Scale.” These songs would soon appear on YoungBoy’s eighteenth mixtape, Colors which would later peak at #2 on the Billboard 200.

Later in the year, just a month afterward, YoungBoy would find himself in a viral controversy with the Chicago native, Lil Durk as both of them exchanged brutal disses from Durk’s “AHHH HA,” to YoungBoy’s “I Hate YoungBoy” — both regarding the death of King Von.

Following his hastily start to 2022, YoungBoy would partner up with DaBaby to present the duo’s joint mixtape, BETTER THAN YOU in March. The mixtape would later peak at #10 on the Billboard 200, this would mark YoungBoy’s ninth top ten.

On April 1, 2022, continuing his victorious run, YoungBoy would release The Last Slimeto Sampler, a sample album for his August release, The Last Slimeto. This album would mark YoungBoy’s final album with Atlantic Records.

On July 15, 2022, YoungBoy was found not guilty of his federal guns charge. In a interview on Instagram, YoungBoy announced that he and his team were planning to go on tour.

As planned, on August 5, 2022, YoungBoy released The Last Slimeto which would mark his last album with Atlantic Records, completing the contract. The album would also peak at #1 on the Billboard 200 marking his fifth #1 album. The project would also break a tie with Taylor Swift as it scored a #1 album in each of the past four years.

On September 6, 2022, YoungBoy released Realer 2 as a surprise release, it is presented as a sequel to his December 2018, Realer. Just over a month following the release of Realer 2, YoungBoy released the Juvenile-influenced mixtape, 3800 Degrees which would peak at #12 on the Billboard 200. Two weeks prior to the release of 3800 Degrees, YoungBoy would release yet another mixtape hosted by DJ Drama as a part of his Gangsta Grillz series titled Ma’ I Got A Family.

Through Billboard, on October 24, 2022, it was announced that following YoungBoy’s departure from Atlantic Records, beginning 2023, he would release music under a joint venture deal between his own Never Broke Again and Motown Records. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/YoungBoy+Never+Broke+Again"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

81,81,ilytommy,486523,8738476,"Tommelik Ward (born March 16, 2000), better known by his stage name ilyTOMMY (formerly Haroinfather), is a rapper with very catchy and melodic songs such as “princess bubblegum,” “Forever,” and “Tunnel of Love.”

Emerging in 2017 under the alias of Haroinfather, rapper Tommelik Ward debuted with a distinctly lo-fi rap sound: gloomy tracks like ""Lonely Nights"" and ""Slave to the Hurt"" were characterized by their muffled vocals, pained stories, and themes of inner turmoil. Through the early stages of 2018, the rapper tested new ideas, releasing the singer-songwriter style of ""We're All Lost"" and the confident, upbeat ""Listen."" But it was on ""She's My Lover Girl"" that the rapper would find his signature sound: converting short samples into mellow, looping production, Ward used his low-toned vocals to create one- to two-minute rap ballads, lamenting lost loves and pining after the objects of his affection. The rapper's second song in this style, the jazzier ""Princess Bubblegum,"" became one of his breakout hits and by 2021, it had received over 100 million digital streams.

After closing out the year with similar tracks like ""Mia Wallace"" and ""Table for Two,"" Ward adopted a cockier sound in the early stages of 2019, working with Savage Ga$p and Keshore for the hedonistic ""It's Only Right to Fall in Love Twice"" and dropping further tracks ""Lavagirl"" and ""PEP$I."" His creative synergy with Savage Ga$p would continue in a second major hit, the Legend of Zelda-sampling ""Tunnel of Love,"" followed by the more melancholy stylings of ""Please Pick Up"" and ""Us vs. the World."" A third major hit, ""Forever,"" arrived shortly after: with its evocative sample of Yuna's ""Lullabies,"" the track spun troubled romances and personal struggles into an intoxicating blend and soon garnered more than 100 million streams online.

Ward moved into 2020 alongside Savage Ga$p: the duo dropped ""Maybe It's for the Best,"" and the ""Tunnel of Love (Remix)"" in late 2019, before collaborating on tracks ""Like Dat"" and ""I'm Drunk and I Miss You Too"" in early 2020. A few solo tracks, including the vocally led ""Jennifer's Body,"" closed out the year before the rapper continued into 2021 with tracks ""Paris Hilton"" and ""Tinkerbell.""

He built his love-driven rap sounds on bare-bones samples and narratives of conflicted romance. His mellow approach to the genre found a major following in the early 2020s, with tracks like ""Forever"" and ""Princess Bubblegum"" racking up more than 100 million streams apiece. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/ilyTOMMY"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1) Miguel Duran:
Hearing the sounds of his father's instrumental harmonies and melodic tunes before his birth would only make it natural for Miguel Duran to bear the innate ability to follow in his own father's footsteps as a musician. On September 24th, 1981 in Washington DC, Miguel Duran was born. His father would make it a point to teach Miguel everything he knew about music. He knew it wouldn't be an easy task to raise a kid in a cruel harsh world, but he had faith that music would show him the right path.
Listening to the cling and the clatter of the timbales in salsa and Merengue on a vinyl LP in his living room, is where Miguel would learn who great singers such as Frankie Ruiz, Juan Luis Guerra, Hector Lavo, and others were that had a tremendous impact in his own culture, in Latin music. Outside of his home, Miguel would be known as Fuego. On the streets speakers would fill the air with strong beats and rattle the houses with bass sounds showing a thunderous demonstration of love for hip-hop and rap. He'd learn who Biggie Smalls, Tu-Pac, Bone Thugs, and Big Pun were. He'd listen intensely to their style and the way they would flow with their unforgettable rhymes and cherished hooks. The street was his classroom, and his main subject was hip-hop. Within those two worlds is where Fuego would look within himself and make his distinctive style of music.
In 1998 he formed part of a group called 3MEN2 (Tremendo). The group tried very hard to work together and to take their music to the public. However, times were difficult. Each member had to think about how they were going to sustain themselves before following their true passion, music. Unfortunately, everyone decided to go separate ways. Nevertheless, Fuego didn't let that become a reason to give up. He knew that music was his calling. He began to write song after song and tried to get onto as many recordings around his way. He was then given the chance to perform solo. 
In a college auditorium he had to prove to the audience that he was meant to be a star. On stage he began to astonish his audience, with his mesmerizing lyrics and his incredible hooks. The girls started to chant Fuego's name, and music became his enlightenment. Fuego also discovered that his key to his music would be to romanticize his female audience. Music had become his motivation, his fuel. 
Along his path he met DJ Menace. DJ Menace knew that Fuego had potential and the drive to make it in the music industry. He began to help him gain exposure in the area. Menace would book him on local radio stations and shows around Maryland and DC. Menace didn't just introduce Reggaeton to DC and Maryland but he also introduced Fuego to the area. Fuego began to gain recognition in the area by performing every week. With the help from DJ Menace he was getting the practice he needed to one day perform nationwide. Sadly, DJ Menace was involved in a fatal car accident in 2003. Fuego was struck by the news but was given another reason to keep performing. His luck would soon change with his encounter of a very well known duo in the Reggaeton genre, in which would help Fuego's path in his musical career. 
One evening in one of Fuego's performances, a member of Plan B watched his show. Fuego's undeniable talent amazed Chencho. Chencho knew he had to work with him and introduced him to Boy Wonder a well-known producer in the genre. . Boy Wonder was also highly impressed with his exceptional style, and was convinced Fuego could take the genre to the next step. Fuego felt that he was in the right hands and was able to record his track ""Me Gustan Todas"" featured on ""EL Draft O5"". The track became one of the top five singles of the album. Without hesitation Fuego made a decision to sign with Chosen Few Emerald Entertainment. 
Since then Fuego's been able to do collaborations with some of the heavy weights in Reggaeton and Latin Hip-hop. He's been featured in albums such as El Draft 2005, Bob Marley, and Chosen Few El Documental II. Boy Wonder can best describe him as ""Young, fresh, and multi-creative with a dynamic style of singing, rapping, and flowin. He is and will be like the title of his album ""Untouchable"". Fuego currently is working on his own album, which will be released in 2007. He will also featured on LDA, Reychesta, and Getto's albums, and more of Chosen Few productions. He believes that his purpose is ""Bringing something different to the table. Creating different and innovative sounds. Wanting to really blow up the genre, and bring out the soul in Latin hip hop.""

2) Paul Surugiu:
Fuego is not a traditional Christmas artist, but he does a good job, in my opinion singing carols on winter time. His voice is suited for this style and he has some beautiful carols. He is a pop singer, with folkloric experiences. I could not put my finger on his exact musical style and I don’t even bother to, I just listen…

All but one track on the EP was produced by Loyle’s right hand man and live partner Rebel Kleff. The two of them create reminiscent old school hip hop with their own UK and modern influences. 

After first appearing in 2013 on Rejjie Snow’s ‘Rejovich’ EP on track ‘1992’, Loyle’s name started to make the rounds, not least to mention the track being picked up by Majestic Casual and has racked up over 700k views to date. Following the release of the ‘A Little Late’ EP, Loyle has gone on to work with the likes of Kae Tempest, Maverick Sabre, Tom Misch and multiple others, all in preparation for releases in 2015. 

With two successful UK tours now under his belt with Joey Bada$$ and Atmosphere, Loyle is set to make some serious moves on the UK circuit and abroad, with strong support coming from all over Europe, the US and Australia. Support in the UK has come from all areas, being championed on Radio 1Xtra by DJ Semtex and Phil Taggart, Huw Stephens and Lauren Laverne at Radio 1. His latest single with Kate Tempest was added to 6Music’s B-list and then bumped up to the A-List immediately after a week and has not stopped being played.

Carner released his third studio album, 'hugo', in October, 2022.

In 'hugo', there’s a central question that Loyle Carner keeps coming back to: “I’m young, Black, successful and have a platform - but where do I go next?” The answer is explored in this epic scream of a third album. With urgent delivery and gloriously widescreen production, Carner confronts both the deeply personal (“You can’t hate the roots of a tree, and not hate the tree. So how can I hate my father without hating me?) and the highly political (“I told the black man he didn’t understand I reached the white man he wouldn’t take my hand”). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Loyle+Carner"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

114,114,cordae,690903,19428544,"Cordae Amari Dunston (born August 26, 1997), known mononymously as Cordae (formerly known as YBN Cordae and Entendre is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. 

Dunston gained popularity by releasing remixes of popular songs, such as ""My Name Is"" by Eminem, and ""Old N***as"" which was a response to the song ""1985"" by J. Cole. Videos to both remixes were uploaded to the WorldStarHipHop's YouTube channel, which led to an immense and immediate positive response from both mainstream media and the online rap community. His debut studio album, The Lost Boy was released on July 26, 2019 and received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 62nd Grammy Awards. Cordae was a member of the YBN collective from 2018 until the group disbanded in 2020.

Dunston was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, but moved to Suitland, Maryland. As a young child, he'd taken an interest in music as his father would always play classic hip hop around him, from artists such as Rakim, Nas, Big L, and Talib Kweli. He began writing raps around the age of fifteen, but did not take it seriously, as it was only a hobby for him. Following the influence he gained from the music his father listened to, he would do research on certain artists through YouTube, attempting to find similar music and ""getting lost"" in the recommended videos section. Dunston began gaining more interest in pursuing a rap career as he aged, but focused on his education first, although writing lyrics often distracted him from his studies. He released three mixtapes as a teenager under the name ""Entendre"" – Anxiety (2014), I’m So Anxious (2016), and I’m So Anonymous (2017). He graduated from high school in 2015 and decided to go to college at Towson University, later dropping out in 2018, explaining that college was ""bigger than him"" as a first-generation student, and he was mainly doing it for his mother. He moved to Los Angeles shortly afterward.

Dunston began taking his rap career seriously in the beginning of 2018. Although he hadn't been releasing any music with them, he'd often hang around YBN Nahmir and Almighty Jay when visiting Los Angeles, whom he'd initially met through social media. Nahmir had taken interest in a song that Dunston had made with fellow rapper and brother Simba, and reached out to him. Dunston is the only member of YBN that hadn't been introduced to everyone as a gamer, as he doesn't take gaming too seriously. He already felt like he was a part of YBN, the only thing that hadn't solidified his presence being his social media handles, which he soon changed from Entendre to YBN Cordae. He also stated that Entendre had been a name that he'd wanted to change for while, stating ""I was just always around Nahmir and shit, those were just like my brothers... And, I was thinking, yo, I need to change my shit to like, Cordae, and shit, my actual first name. I was already ""YBN"" without the social tag, you know what I'm saying?"" He released his first single, which he called his ""introduction to the world"", in May 2018. It was a remix of the 1999 song ""My Name Is"" by Eminem, which he released along with a music video via WorldStarHipHop on YouTube. Subsequently, he released ""Old N***as"", as a response to ""1985"" by J. Cole, then released the tracks Fighting Temptations and Kung Fu, respectively.

His debut live performance was at the annual Rolling Loud music festival in May 2018, in which he performed with both YBN Nahmir and Almighty Jay. He performed with the duo again for the 2018 XXL Freshman Show in New York City, after Nahmir was announced to be an inductee of the yearly freshman class. Dunston was then announced to be joining Juice WRLD on his North American WRLD Domination tour from May to September 2018, along with Lil Mosey and  Blake, ended up reaching 28 cities. Soon after, it was announced that YBN would be going on a month-long tour in Europe as a collective. Dunston then said he would release multiple singles up until his debut project is complete. On August 2, 2018, both Nahmir and Cordae released a video for their single ""Pain Away"". On August 12, YBN Nahmir announced that an official YBN Mixtape, featuring the trio, would be released September 7, 2018. He released the music video for his single, ""Scotty Pippen"", on August 23, 2018.

On January 28, 2019, Cordae released a music video for a new song titled, ""Locationships"" on his YouTube channel before releasing another song titled, ""Have Mercy"" in March 2019, with the latter song becoming the lead single from his debut studio album, The Lost Boy. He was later named as one of the members of XXL's ""2019 Freshman Class"" on June 20, 2019.[26] Cordae later released ""Bad Idea"" and ""RNP"" as the second and third singles from the album respectively. The Lost Boy was released on July 26, 2019. The album landed YBN Cordae two nominations at the 62nd Grammy Awards; Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song for the single ""Bad Idea"". In November 2019, Cordae announced that he would be headlining ""The Lost Boy in America Tour"", which began in January 2020.

On August 6, 2020, YBN Nahmir took to Twitter to announce that the YBN collective officially disbanded. Cordae subsequently dropped the YBN from his stage name. On August 27, Cordae released a new single, ""Gifted"", featuring Roddy Ricch, marking Cordae's first release of 2020. Cordae has been currently working on his second album.

116,116,delinquent habits,222115,2535048,"Delinquent Habits (a.k.a. Los Delinquentes) is a Chicano hip-hop group. Formed in Los Angeles in 1991, they are known for their Latin-tinged rap, which is both melodic and hardcore. Their first album was executive produced by Cypress Hill member Sen Dog and featured guest appearances by Sen himself as well as Puerto Rican New York City rapper Hurricane G. Their second album, Here Come The Horns, again featured Sen Dog as well as Sen's brother, pioneering Latin rapper Mellow Man Ace. The melodic ""Merry Go Round"" featured the female singer Michelle. The group chose to focus more on hardcore rap on their fourth offering, ""Freedom Band"".

The group itself originally consisted of two MCs, Ives and Kemo, and O.G. Style as the DJ. Thus the group was often called ""Los Tres Delinquentes"" (In English: ""The Three Delinquents""). In 1996, the group garnered international success with their first single ""Tres Delinquentes"" selling over one million copies. The success of the song pushed the group's self-titled album to nearly the same figure. Kemo soon left after the completion of their album Freedom Band to pursue a solo career with some substantial success. He was replaced by female vocalist Michelle, who had been previously featured in their songs

Rapper Ives makes one thing clear right from the start: ""Delinquent Habits is no Old-School-Band, we are fresh and constantly looking for something new."" On their new album ""The Common Man"" (09.10.2009) Delinquent Habits appear fresh for the first time in ages. The vibrant beats, the hot groove and the catchy lyrics make it clear: Someone knows how to rock the stage.

In the latter half of the 90's, Delinquent Habits along with Cypress Hill made it to the very top of Latin-Hip Hop. Rapper Ives and Kemo as well as DJ O.G Style combined Hip Hop beats with Funk and Miriachi trumpets and rapped in a mixture of Spanish and English called ""Spanglish"".

In 1996 they achieved a world-wide hit with ""Tres Delinquentes"". Their debut ""Delinquent Habits"" sold over 1 million copies and has achieved ""hip hop classic"" status the success of which is noticeable until this day. Sold-out tours in Europe and in the USA and four album releases, amongst these on their own label ""Station 13, are testament to this impressive feat. Delinquent Habits live the crossover and show no reservation. The Matiachi-Rappers shared stages with different acts such as Beck, Korn and The Fugees. Their songs were used in various soundtracks, as well as computer games, not to mention sportswear giant Nike added the DelHab-Song ""Return Of The Tres"" to its TV advert which was broadcast world-wide.

After Kemo und O.G. Style pulled out, Ives is the last remaining member of the original band and now head and songwriter of Delinquent Habits. But this is no reason for Ives to mope: ""Now I am able to have an input in all aspects of our music, beginning with the lyrics to the beats to the point of who I want to work with. This way ""The Common Man"" emerged, in collaboration with different producers such as Sick Jacken (Psycho Realm), Andre Horstmann (Pet Shop Boys, All Saints) or the Superstar DJs, which injected new life and ideas into the typical Delinquent Habits sound.

Ives finds his inspiration for his lyrics on the streets of his barrio and so on his new album ""The Common Man"", there is no mistaking - more critical and harsh tones next to the typical party tunes. This is reflected perfectly in the debut track, in which Ives denounces in a wonderful play on words society’s increasing egotism and the thieving mentality of the big bosses: ""They livin high on the hog but they really just all swine''.
Nevertheless Delinquent Habits still know that there is also room for the light-hearted side to life, which is best celebrated with hot parties.

He hails from affluent Beverly Hills, California. After rising to prominence in the late 1990s as a close associate of Dilated Peoples, he went on to produce for many of hip-hop's leading artists in the 2000s.

As a teen, Al began to identify strongly with the rebellious lyrics and urban sounds of hip-hop, and he began writing his own lyrics as a creative outlet. He joined up with other like-minded artists who wrote lyrics and rebelled strongly against their ""uptight"" suburban surroundings, among whom were Shifty Shellshock of Crazy Town, Evidence of Dilated Peoples and Scott Caan, son of James Caan. They would often hang out in urban areas of Los Angeles and participated in typical teenage rebellious activities like partying, smoking marijuana, and general mischief.

Al and Scott decided to become a duo named The Whooliganz. While rhyming at a party in L.A., they attracted the attention of B-Real of Cypress Hill. He invited the teens to join his crew, The Soul Assassins, which also included the groups House of Pain and Funkdoobiest. In 1993, the Whooliganz released their first single, ""Put Your Handz Up."" The song received little radio airplay and their record label, Tommy Boy Records, decided to shelve their album. Rejected, Scott focused his creative energy on acting while Al became interested in process of making hip-hop beats.

DJ Muggs took Al under his wing and taught him how to use a sampler and mixing board. After helping to produce a few tracks for Cypress Hill, Al became the main producer for his childhood friend, Evidence and his group Dilated Peoples. When Dilated debuted in 1998, they were an underground sensation creating a huge buzz about the man behind those incredible beats.

In 1999, Muggs introduced Al to his good friends, the popular hip-hop group Mobb Deep. Al produced two songs for their Murda Muzik album. Impressed by his production skills and street smarts, Mobb Deep took him under their wing, using his beats on all their subsequent albums. As Alchemist's profile increased, he went on to produce for many of hip hop's most successful and prominent artists, such as Nas, Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Ghostface Killah and Snoop Dogg. He has also remixed songs for bands and artists in other genres such as Linkin Park and Morcheeba. Al stayed loyal to his old friends, continuing to produce for Dilated, Cypress Hill, Everlast (formerly of House of Pain) and Crazy Town. He also enjoys producing for lesser-known underground rappers, often giving them some of his best beats. In 2004, 11 years after his rapping career folded, The Alchemist returned with his long-awaited debut album, ""1st Infantry."" The album yielded the hit single ""Hold You Down"" (featuring Prodigy, Illa Ghee, and Nina Sky), which hit number ninety-five on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2005.

Alchemist was the official tour DJ for Eminem on his 2005 Anger Management 3 Tour, replacing the recently-ousted DJ Green Lantern. However on July 13, 2005, the tour bus carrying Eminem's entourage (including rapper Stat Quo as well as Alchemist) swerved off the road and turned over. Alchemist was treated for broken ribs and a collapsed lung.

The Alchemist is one of the music producers behind the video game Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars released by Rockstar Games. He was also on Tim Westwood TV, when Eminem, Royce Da 5'9"" and Mr. Porter freestyled. During an interview with Worldwide Conspiracy Radio, The Alchemist revealed he would be dropping a 2-part project with fellow West Coast producer Oh No entitled Gangrene, the first to be released in July, the second in November, both on Decon. Alchemist was also the DJ for the Eminem set on the BBC1 chat-show Jonathan Ross on June 4, 2010.

Alchemist is Eminem's official DJ, since DJ Green Lantern departed from Shady Records in 2005 because of a dispute related to the feud of 50 Cent and Jadakiss. In 2006, Eminem released a collaboration album with Shady Records called Eminem Presents: The Re-Up. Since the Alchemist is his official DJ, he produced some of the tracks on the mixtape, as well as compiling the album in a mixtape fashion. On December 18, 2013, he was named the runner-up for Producer of the Year by HipHopDX. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Alchemist"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1. Elmo Kennedy O'Connor, known professionally as Bones, is an American rapper from Howell, Michigan. He is notable for the frenetic pace at which he releases new music, including over 40 mix tapes and 88 music videos since 2011, and his resistance to signing with a major record label or charging money for his music despite significant popularity and label interest. Born to a mother who designed clothing and a father who was a web designer. His grandfather was actor Robert Culp. When Bones was 7 years old, his family moved to Howell, Michigan. When he was 16, he dropped out of high school and moved to Los Angeles where his brother, Elliott, had already been living.

He has collaborated on three tracks with Raider Klan member Eddy Baker, including “High”, “Delinquents”, and “PayPal” off of Bones's albums Saturn (2013), Creep (2013), and Garbage (2014). Bones also performs and collaborates often with Xavier Wulf and another former Raider Klan member Chris Travis.

In 2014, Bones self-released 5 mixtapes through his label TeamSesh, including Garbage, which received coverage and critical acclaim from notable publications including The Fader, Pigeons & Planes, and RESPECT.
Bones headlined a sold out show at the House of Blues in Los Angeles on March 4, 2015. and opened for Shlohmo at The Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles on May 7, 2015. The hook from Bones' song ""Dirt"" was featured in ASAP Rocky's ""Canal St."" on the 2015 At. Long. Last. ASAP album.

On September 17, 2015, Bones performed ""Canal St."" with ASAP Rocky on the Jimmy Kimmel Live! show but was cut from the TV broadcast. Videos of the performance were made available online.  Bones and his manager Elliott O’Connor, who is also his brother, have both stated that major labels have shown interest in signing him but he has declined up to this point. According to Max Bell of LA Weekly, ""interested labels wanted him to be their 'white rapper,' an artist along the lines of Mac Miller and Machine Gun Kelly. But Bones wasn't interested in being remade.

4.  Part performance artist, part ego drenched rock star, Bones rips delta blues with punks intensity, and throws in a little stripper jazz for colour. With the delivery of a storefront preacher, The Man Named Bones (the alter ego of one Michael Miller) sings, screams and growls Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll with tongue firmly in cheek. Armed with an upright bass, an electric guitar, a sampler and a drum machine, Bones is a one man blues/punk machine.

5. Bones was an untitled noise project released on the French static noise / HNW label Slow Death Music, believed to by Julien Skrobek.

123,123,lil uzi vert,2203863,318255897,"Symere Bysil Woods (born July 31, 1995, Philadelphia, USA), known professionally as Lil Uzi Vert, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. Characterized by their face tattoos, facial piercings, eccentric hairstyles, and androgynous fashion, their music is often defined by dark subject matters and imagery built on a melodic emo approach to trap.

They attracted mainstream attention following the release of their debut single ""Money Longer"" in 2016. The song would act as the lead single for the subsequent mixtape ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World"". After releasing two additional mixtapes in 2016 and 2017, including one in collaboration with Gucci Mane, Lil Uzi Vert was featured on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. They later secured their first top 10 single with ""XO Tour Llif3"", which won the MTV Video Music Award for Song of the Summer.

""XO Tour Llif3"" acted as the lead single to Lil Uzi Vert's debut studio album ""Luv Is Rage 2"" (2017), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 2018 Grammy Awards, Lil Uzi Vert was nominated for Best New Artist. Their second studio album ""Eternal Atake"" (2020) was among the most anticipated albums in hip hop and peaked at number one on the Billboard 200.

2010–2015: Career beginnings
Woods began to rap in 2010 and began to associate with musical groups like Steaktown, in what he said was ""just for money"", under the name ""Sealab Vertical"". They later changed their name to Lil Uzi Vert from the way someone described their rap flow, saying their flow was ""Fast, like a machine gun"". Woods' first project, an EP titled ""Purple Thoughtz Vol. 1"", was released on January 19, 2014. The project, which was described as ""phonk"" and having cloud rap beats due to its psychedelic and ""trippy"" production, features a bigger focus on lyricism and was released with the single ""White Shit"". The track, produced by Spaceghostpurrp, went viral in 2017 within hip-hop circles following Woods' entry into the mainstream. Shortly after the release of their first project, Woods caught the attention of then industry-mainstays like Mob.

The EP and following features caught the attention of producer and cofounder of Atlantic Records Don Cannon after DJ Diamond Kuts played one of their songs on a local radio station. Cannon then produced and hosted their first mixtape, ""The Real Uzi"", which was released on August 5, 2014. After the release of ""The Real Uzi"", Woods signed a record deal with Atlantic Records through DJ Drama, Don Cannon's, and Leighton Morrison's imprint, Generation Now.

Following their signing to Atlantic Records, Woods was featured alongside Kid and Ferg on Carnage's single ""WDYW"". They also released several songs on SoundCloud including ""No Wait"", produced by Metro Booming, ""Pressure"", which is a collaboration with Durk, and  ''Loaf"". He was featured on Fall Out Boy and Khalifa's ""Boys of Zummer"" tour in August 2015.

Woods released their second mixtape, ""Luv Is Rage"" on October 30, 2015. The project was received positively and was featured on numerous music blogs such as Fader, XXL, and Vibe. They were further called a ""breakout artist of 2015"" by HotNewHipHop.

2016: Breakthrough
In February 2016, they released the single, ""Money Longer"" on their SoundCloud following a radio debut on Shade 45. 

On April 15, 2016, Vert released their third mixtape and first commercial mixtape ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World"". The mixtape debuted at number 37 on the Billboard 200 chart, making it their first entry on said chart. The project spent 55 weeks on the Billboard 200, eventually being certified Gold. Lil Uzi Vert and Kapri embarked on a joint tour in May 2016, titled the ""Parental Advisory"" tour.

In June 2016, Uzi appeared in XXL magazine as part of their 2016 Freshmen Class. As part of this appearance, Uzi performed a ‘freshman cypher’ alongside Denzel Curry, Lil Yachty, 21 Savage, and Kodak Black. Riding the wave of recognition the XXL Freshman list gave them, Woods released the video for the single ""Money Longer"" which debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 the following week, their first entry on the chart, at number 92 on July 2, 2016. The song later peaked at number 54 and is currently certified two times platinum in the United States. Woods' second entry on the chart, ""You Was Right"", debuted at 89 on July 30, 2016  and peaked at number 40.

On July 12, 2016, Woods announced their fourth mixtape, ""The Perfect LUV Tape"", which was released on July 31, their 22nd birthday. The mixtape featured the singles ""Seven Million"", featuring Future, and ""Erase Your Social"", both of which failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. The mixtape debuted at number 55 on the Billboard 200 album chart and is certified Gold by the RIAA. In October 2016, Woods was announced to be an additional artist on The Weeknd's ""Starboy: legend of the Fall"" tour.

Lil Uzi Vert announced a collaboration mixtape with Gucci Mane titled ""1017 vs. The World"", which was released on November 23, 2016. On the 27th, Uzi announced ""Luv Is Rage 2"" which went through a series of delays.

2017: Luv Is Rage 2
Uzi was featured on Migos' single ""Bad and Boujee"". The single was released on August 31, 2016, and its from the trio's second studio album ""Culture"". In January 2017, around the time the album was released, the single reached the top of the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Uzi's first number 1 single as a lead or featured artist, and their highest charting single as both. On February 27, 2017, Woods released the EP ""Luv Is Rage 1.5"" while on tour with The Weeknd. The EP was positively received for its ""nerdy"" nature, with Kingdom Hearts themed instrumentals and lyrics referring to anime, Steven Universe, and hentai. The EP was also credited as the start of Uzi's affiliation with the ""emo-rapper"" label due to the heartbreak-associated lyrics on the song ""Luv Scars K.o 1600"" and references to threats of suicide and depression on the stand-out track ""XO Tour Llif3"".

""XO Tour Llif3"" got significant popularity on SoundCloud, resulting in Uzi playing it live on the European leg of The Weeknd's tour, and the following week the song was added to streaming services and released as an official single. On April 4, 2017, ""Xo Tour Llif3"" debuted on Billboard Hot 100 at number 49 and peaked at number 7, becoming the rapper's highest charting song and biggest song, being certified 6x platinum as of August 2018.

""Luv Is Rage 2"" was delayed again on April 2, 2017, with Uzi blaming it on DJ Drama. On April 9, Don Cannon confirmed the project wasn't getting released ""any time soon"" and confirmed that ""XO Tour Llif3"" would be on the album. Uzi was featured on fellow rapper Playboi Carti's single ""wokeuplikethis*"", released on April 7. The single was performed by the pair at Coachella 2017.

""wokeuplikethis*"" was eventually certified platinum and peaked at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100. Uzi was featured alongside ASAP Rocky, Playboi Carti, Quavo, and Frank Ocean on A$AP rappers collective Mob's single ""RAF"". The single was released by surprise on May 15, 2017. In early August, hip-hop media personality DJ Akademiks claimed that ""Luv Is Rage 2"" would be released within 30 days. On August 24, 2017, ""Luv Is Rage 2"" was announced for a surprise release at midnight, and on August 25, 2017, Lil Uzi Vert released their heavily delayed debut studio album, which included ""XO TOUR Llif3"" as the lead single.

The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart, with 135,000 album-equivalent units, and has since been certified platinum. The album also created ten Billboard Hot 100 charting singles, with two of them, ""The Way Life Goes"" and ""Sauce It Up"", becoming singles. During british singer Ed Sheeran's set at the Video Music Awards, Uzi Vert and Sheeran performed a medley of ""XO Tour Llif3"" and Sheeran's chart-topping single, ""Shape Of You"".

In September 2017, Woods teased a possible sequel project to ""Lil Uzi Vert vs The World"", possibly titled ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World 2"", and a collaboration project with Playboi Carti titled ""16*29"". In October, a joint tour with Playboi Carti called the ""16*29 tour"" was announced, further promoting the possibility of a collaboration project. The tour was canceled shortly thereafter due to Uzi claiming he needed to ""focus"". In October 2017, Uzi headlined Power 105.1's annual Powerhouse music celebration alongside The Weeknd, Migos, and Cardi B, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Uzi was also featured on Canadian rapper Nav's platinum-certified single ""Wanted You"". The song was released on November 3, 2017.

On December 4, 2017, ""The Way Life Goes"" music video was released with a remix featuring Nicki Minaj. The song peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Hot 100. Uzi Vert performed the song on Stephen Colbert's The Late Show on February 6, 2018.

They were featured alongside Kanye West on Travis Scott's song, ""Watch"", which was released on May 3, 2018. ""Watch"" debuted at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. They were also featured on a remix for fellow rapper Lil Tracy's single ""Like a Farmer"".

2018–2020: Eternal Atake, Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World 2, and Pluto x Baby Pluto

In January 2018, Uzi announced that he had completed a mixtape with record producer Wheezy. In May 2018, Don Cannon confirmed that a new Uzi project was dropping that year and speculation arose in July 2018 when Uzi tweeted the words ""Eternal Atake"", the title of their second studio album, pinning the tweet and announcing it was ""coming soon"", then at the end of the month sharing the then-chosen cover art for the project. The art referenced the logo of the cult Heavens Gate. The two members who survived the cult suggested that legal actions could be taken against Uzi for copying the logo style.

The art was the source of a threat from the remaining members of the organization over a legal attack. The then-thought lead single for the album, ""New Patek"" was released on September 18, 2018. Uzi was then featured on Lil Pump's single, ""Multi Millionaire"". The single was released on October 5, 2018.

In April 2019, following label trouble with Generation Now, it was announced that Uzi was now signed to Roc Nation. Two new promotional singles were released in April 2019, titled ""Sanguine Paradise"" and ""That's a Rack"", originally thought to be from their highly anticipated studio album, ""Eternal Atake"".

On December 13, 2019, Uzi released a new single titled ""Futsal Shuffle 2020"", which is the lead single of ""Eternal Atake"". The rapper then released the second single of the album, ""That Way"", on March 1, 2020.

""Eternal Atake"" was released on March 6, 2020, with a sole guest appearance from American singer Syd. ""New Patek"", ""That's a Rack"" and ""Sanguine Paradise"" did not appear on the album. ""Eternal Atake"" debuted atop the Billboard 200.

On March 12, 2020, Lil Uzi teased that the deluxe version of ""Eternal Atake"" and the sequel to their 2016 mixtape, ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World"", titled ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World 2"", would be released the following day, the date fans expected the release date of the original album.

The deluxe edition would have fourteen new tracks, featuring guest appearances from Chief Keef, 21 Savage, Future, Young Thug, Gunna, Lil Durk, Young Nudy, and Nav. The first half of the album maintained a leading number 1 position with 400 million streams in early 2020. This marked the largest streaming count for any album since 2018, when Lil Wayne's twelfth studio album, ""Tha Carter V"", got 433 million streams.

On April 24, 2020, Lil Uzi Vert released a new single titled ""Sasuke"". On July 10, Lil Uzi appeared on the remix of StaySolidRocky's ""Party Girl"". On July 21, Lil Uzi and Future hinted at an upcoming joint project titled ""Pluto x Baby Pluto"" on their social medias; it was released on November 13, 2020, and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200.

2021–2022: Subsequent ventures
In late 2020, Lil Uzi Vert began promoting new singles on Instagram Live that were sonically similar to popular releases early on in their career. He announced an upcoming project titled ""Forever Young"", as well as a follow-up to ""Luv Is Rage 2"".

From the 16th to the 22nd of july 2022, Uzi released 4 songs from their EP, RED & WHITE on their SoundCloud account day by day, then, on the 22nd, the rest of the EP was released.

2023 - Present
In June 2023, Uzi noted that the album would be released that same month. On the 17th, Uzi had taken to Instagram to post an alternate cover art to the project. He  also announced that the cover art would release in ""a couple of days"" and that the tracklist would release ""this week,"" while confirming the release date of June 30.

On June 26, 2023, Uzi revealed the cover art and the release date on their website and simultaneously released the Gibson Hazard directed trailer for the album. Days prior to it's official announcement, Uzi threw an album release party — which he named “The Pink Tape Prom” — in which he previewed several tracks from the project.

On June 30, 2023, Lil Uzi Vert released the highly anticipated album, ""Pink Tape"". The album contains guest appearances from Travis Scott, Nicki Minaj, Bring Me The Horizon, Don Toliver, and Babymetal. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/LIL+UZI+VERT"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1) Hardcore arranger, principal arranger of KINZOK ON from Japan.
Also known as morrrrrro
KINZOK ON bandcamp: https://kinzokon.bandcamp.com/music
MORO on Twitter: https://twitter.com/moro_108


2) Moro is a beast composed of two reasonably-sentient beings: Nolan Thomas and Daniel Lee Ruff Smith, and born in the hills surrounding a village known as Eau Claire, WI. The beast is sometimes called ""M o r o"", or ""M O R O"" by different tribes.

After writhing in front of crowds of jubilant townsfolk a few times, and Lee Ruff taking a brief absence to travel to the Land of Thais, it regurgitated it's first offspring-- ""Embers""-- in a fiery cough. The townsfolk went mad for it, but it was too jittery to stay in one place, so it travelled throughout the globe on the back of the root-god Pando, whom some know as The Interwebs, among other names. The child was aided in it's travels by MJMJ Records and many friends.

Then Lee Ruff heard callings from afar, and split from it's Nolan-half to gain knowledge in the far off land of España for one half an earth cycle. Though less powerful due to their separation, the two beings were able to communicate with the aid of their friend-god Pando, speaking into his roots and sensing the vibrations on the other end. 

With a seed planted in their minds by the ancient tree-and-worker guardians, Simon & Garfunkel, they combined their powers and dreamed into existence their second child, ""Sound of Silence"". This child was requested of them by the Pando-rider Cactus-Mouth, who then took it forth along the roots and raised it as his own. 

It was then that Nolan-half began to feel unsatisfied with his choice to study the ancient and time-honored craft of Illustration, and made leave from the temple of UW-Eau Claire, at least for a time. With his newfound freedom and an approaching 21st birth-festival, his mother, Keli, offered forth the means for Nolan-half to visit the city København, in the realm of Danmark-- close to the Witch Woods of Sverige, where the Old Gods dwell. He sought refuge with his pal-being Mirko, and stayed in the living room of two wonderful she-Danes. 

By some chance of fate, Lee Ruff was also in the region, and the two beings were able to briefly reunite in the north-country of Uppsala, deep within the Witch Woods of Sverige. It was a long and perilous journey for Nolan-half, battling Sex-Trolls and SJ Railways, and his ability to communicate with Pando grew weak, causing many confusions. But through it all, he eventually found the Lee Ruff, and all was merry. Moro stomped as one through the halls of Upsalla by day, and gazed into it's clear pools by night, discussing with reasonable-sentience the nature of The Creator or The Great Unknown. Cats and ducks came to listen in and gain knowledge, but were keen to hide their own sentience. 

Alas, Moro was forced to split once again, returning to Eau Claire and España respectively. Nolan-half used up all his coins on food and travel in Danmark and Sverige, and now really really needs to get a job.

The two halves of Moro have resolved to sleep until June of the earth-cycle 2011, when they can be reunited once more in the village Eau Claire, and writhe for crowds and spew forth new offspring, and send them forth into the world with Pando and alive with Moro's magical instruments, and travel throughout the land with village-friends and make many many anew. The beast will be unstoppable. maybe. It will never stop dreaming.

single ""Ooouuu"". Young M.A was born in 1992 in Brooklyn , New York . At the age of 9, she began rapping. Over the next nine years, she was residing in Virginia , although never staying in one place for long, moving to several cities while in the South. At the age of 16, she moved back to Brooklyn. 

Young M.A started rapping by a corner store when she was young after a few years her music career started , when she was self-funding its recording studio with local record producers , after she was working at Shake Shack and T.J. Maxx. [4] In 2014, she gained notoriety, when a Facebook post criticizing her song, called ""Brooklyn Chiraq"" that went viral. [5] The post's author, pundit Boyce Watkins, said the song promoted ""violent, negative, genocidal energy"", but the controversy expanded Young M.A's name recognition and brought in some new listeners to her work. [3] In 2015, Young M.A released a new song, called ""Body Bag"", which became a ""YouTube hit"" said Rolling Stone, [5] along with the release of her mixtape, called Sleep Walkin ', which MTV describes as a ""thoughtful debut project"". 
In 2016, Young M.A released her official debut single, called ""Ooouuu"", [4] which peaked at number 19 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. [7] In September 2016, the song nearly had 7 million plays on Spotify [8] and was widely remixed, with other rappers and hip hop artists such as French Montana, Remy Ma, Jadakiss , Uncle Murda , ASAP Ferg and Tink , who all of them were putting out their versions to that song. [3] At Stereogum , Tom Breihan said ""Ooouuu"" was ""a brash, intense, hard-as-fuck piece of rider music...the song feels like it marks the arrival of a major rap talent."" [9]

The Fader said Young M.A has ""establishe[d] herself as a quintessential New York MC"", [10] and at MTV, Doreen St. Félix said, ""This summer, the atmosphere belongs to Young M.A and her single 'OOOUUU.'"" [6] The song's popularity drew attention from labels, [11] though M.A remains an independent artist.
At the 2016's BET Hip Hop Awards , she did a freestyle on a cypher and performed her single, ""Ooouuu"", giving what XXL Magazine described as ""show-stopping freestyle...one of the best freestyles of the night""; despite the enthusiasm for her performance, Young M.A expressed disappointment, saying BET cut out a portion of her performance. 

In 2016, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Young M.A said she'd been offered the role of Frieda Gatz on
Empire , but turned it down, preferring to pursue her own career as a rapper instead of being known first as a fictional character.

Young M.A is a lesbian, a topic that she includes in her music. She told Vogue that coming out had been an important point in her artistic development, saying ""I held in being sexually attracted to women for so long that once I got that out of me, the music became easy.""[3] On September 26th 2009, her brother was murdered by a member of his own gang. She is of Puerto Rican and Jamaican descent. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/YOUNG+M.A"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Jacquees participated in his first talent show in fifth grade at Canby Lane Elementary School performing the Jackson 5's, ""I Want You Back,"" winning 1st place. He successfully matriculated to Mary McCleod Bethune Middle School where he continued to compete in talent shows winning every year; two at Bethune Middle and one at the Dekalb County Middle School Talent Show. 

In 2007, Jacquees was introduced to his manager, Orlando Grind, by Dexx Lee. After years of performing in local talent shows, Orlando soon introduced him to Russell ""Block"" Spencer, founder and CEO of Block Entertainment. When Jacquees started going to the studio he merely blended with the team and wasn't given the opportunity to express his true talents. ""When you see work being done around you but not for you, you tend to get discouraged,"" says Jacquees. At that time, Block's focus was only rap, not R&B. It wasn't until summer of 2009 when Block witnessed how talented Jacquees was and shifted his vision. Jacquees began to work closely with Block Entertainment recording and gaining more exposure with the release of his first single ""Krazy"" featuring Grand Hustle's own, T.I. 

Jacquees has recorded with label mates, Gorilla Zoe and Scotty, T.I.P, and an upcoming Atlanta rapper, J-Real. Jacquees dreams to work with established artist Lil Wayne, Drake, Justin Bieber, Bow Wow, Lil' Chuckee, Chris Brown, and many more. ""All of these artists started out at the age I am and are successful in the industry. I look up to them and dream that I will be just as successful as they are,"" Jacquees explains. ""Only better!"" 

""It's truly a blessing to have the opportunity to work with the artist and producers I have already worked with,"" says Jacquees. ""I pray to God every night that I continue on this journey and achieve what I've always dreamed of doing. With God on my side, I know this is only the beginning and there is more to come."" With that in mind, Jacquees will achieve any and everything he wants out of the music industry.

165,165,don toliver,1792340,142399864,"Caleb Zackery “Don” Toliver (born June 12, 1994), is a rapper, singer, and songwriter from Houston, Texas. Toliver began his musical career in May 2017, releasing the collaborative mixtape Playa Familia with friend and fellow rapper Yungjosh93.

Don Toliver’s solo debut came just a few months later, with the debut singles “I Gotta” and “Diva” dropping in November and December, respectively. The singles quickly caught the ear of Atlantic Records, which signed Toliver to the label in March 2018. Under Atlantic, he released his major-label debut album, Donny Womack.

While working on the tape, Toliver caught the attention of fellow Houston native Travis Scott, who invited the young rapper to Hawaii to work on a song on his then-upcoming third studio album, ASTROWORLD. Eagerly accepting, the sessions landed Toliver a feature on the album’s thirteenth track, “CAN’T SAY” by Travis Scott, as well as inspiring him to record much of the material for Donny Womack.

On August 3, 2018, the same day as Travis released his album, he gave a major cosign to Toliver on Twitter:
Coincidentally, on August 2, 2018, Toliver dropped his own project Donny Womack the day before ASTROWORLD.

Genius caught up with the rising Houston artist just a few days before ASTROWORLD’s release to discuss his relationship with Travis, going to Hawaii for the ASTROWORLD sessions, and his hopes for Donny Womack, as his profile gets a dramatic boost.

When Genius asked him about how he met Travis and his relationship with him, he replied:

""When I first started linking up with Travis, somebody from my camp reached out to somebody in his camp. I sent them music and videos and it got to Travis and he was feeling it. He came back and we were able to link up and vibe.""

In May 2019, he released his single “No Idea”, the lead single of his March 2020 debut studio album, Heaven Or Hell. “No Idea” got its popularity from the viral social media app, TikTok, on all the lip-sync and dance videos on the app.

In December 2019, JACKBOYS (Cactus Jack Records members) and Travis Scott released their compilation album, JACKBOYS. On the album, Toliver has a track, titled “Had Enough” (also on Heaven Or Hell), featuring Quavo and Offset from the hip-hop trio Migos. He was also featured on another track by JACKBOYS and Travis, titled “WHAT TO DO?” from the album. He, Travis, and Luxury Tax provided vocals on another track by JACKBOYS and Sheck Wes, titled “GANG GANG”.

On January 17, 2020, Toliver took another big leap in his career. American rapper Eminem released his eleventh studio album, Music to Be Murdered By, in which Toliver featured on the eighteenth track, “No Regrets”. The song’s producer, D.A. Doman, recruited Toliver to record and sing the chorus at the “last minute”.

On March 13, 2020, Toliver released Heaven Or Hell, his debut studio album through Cactus Jack Records and Atlantic Records. It contains features from Travis Scott, Kaash Paige, Quavo, Offset, and Sheck Wes.

168,168,50 cent,4195721,87048286,"Curtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975 in South Jamaica, Queens, New York), better known by his stage name 50 Cent, is a Grammy award nominated rapper, actor, singer, entrepreneur, author and founder of the hip hop group and label G-Unit. 

Jackson was born and raised in South Jamaica, a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. His mother Sabrina, a drug dealer, died in a fire when he was 8. Since his father had already abandoned the family, young Curtis was sent to live with his grandparents. Growing up during the crack epidemic of the 80s and 90s, Jackson dealt drugs when he wasn't ""killing time"" at school or boxing at a local gym. His grandparents assumed he was at after-school programs when he was out selling crack. In tenth grade, Jackson was caught with guns and drug money passing through the metal detectors at Andrew Jackson High School in Queens. In 1994, Jackson was arrested again for selling vials of cocaine to an undercover officer, and three weeks later he was arrested yet-again after police found heroin, crack cocaine, and a starter pistol in his home. Jackson was sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison, but opted to join a 6 month boot camp program and get his GED. Around this time, Jackson began going by ""50 Cent,"" inspired by deceased Brooklyn stick-up man Kelvin ""50 Cent"" Martin. 

After leaving drug dealing to pursue a rap career, he released his debut album Guess Who's Back Again in 2002. He was discovered by Eminem and Dr. Dre and then signed to Interscope Records. He has since released Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2003), The Massacre (2006), Curtis (2007) and Before I Self Destruct (2009).

50 Cent has engaged in feuds with other rappers including Jay-Z, Ja Rule, The Game, Cam'ron, Fat Joe, and Rick Ross. He has also pursued an acting career, appearing in the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin' in 2005, the Iraq War film Home of the Brave in 2006, and Righteous Kill in 2008. 50 Cent is one of the richest hip-hop performers, having a net worth estimated at US $440 million in 2008.

Before 50 Cent ever inked a major deal, he built up a substantial fan base in New York through underground mixtapes. 50 Cent met up with Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC and was signed to his label to write all of Jay’s music. After he’d left JMJ, he signed to Columbia Records in 1996. On this label, he released Power of the Dollar, and the singles How to Rob and Ghetto Qua Ran. Columbia Records released him from the label after being shot on May 24th, 2000.

Around this time, Eminem had heard one of 50 Cent’s demo tapes and expressed a huge interest in him on MTV, as did Dr. Dre. Shortly after this, 50 Cent officially signed to Interscope Records. He was the first rapper to sign to the joint label owned by Dr. Dre and Eminem. The first song he released on this record was entitled Wanksta and was featured on the 8 Mile soundtrack.

In its first week of release, his debut ”Get Rich Or Die Tryin’” sold 872,000 units - easily reaching Gold status. Within the second week it went Platinum (1 mil) and on April 12th, 2004 the RIAA certified it six times Platinum.

In 2005 he followed the success of his album Get Rich or Die Tryin’ with a new release - The Massacre (originally called St. Valentines Day Massacre until the release date was pushed back). The first single released off this, Disco Inferno, was a huge hit - he followed this hit up by the release of Candy Shop and then again with Just a Lil Bit.

In 2003 Interscope Records allowed 50 Cent to have his own label - G-Unit Records. He first signed Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck as the established members of G-Unit Records. In 2004, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent had signed The Game under a joint venture. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/50+Cent"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

172,172,dj khaled,2501506,49368108,"Khaled Mohammed Khaled (/ˈkælɪd/; born November 26, 1975),[3] known professionally as DJ Khaled, is an American DJ, record producer, and record executive. Originally a Miami-based radio personality, Khaled has since become known for enlisting high-profile music industry artists to perform on singles and albums, for which he often serves as hype man. His distinctions are his booming voice presence, ""motivational"" abstractions, and numerous catchphrases. While his musical contribution is often questioned, Khaled's role has been described as ""organization, direction, [and] promotion"".[4][5]

Khaled was born in New Orleans to Palestinian immigrant parents. He first gained recognition as a radio host in the 1990s for the radio station 99 Jamz, and translated his popularity by working with Fat Joe's hip hop collective, Terror Squad, as a DJ for their live performances. Following his production credits on the group's material,[6] Khaled enlisted several hip hop artists associated with the group and his native Miami to perform on his debut studio album, Listennn... the Album (2006). His second album, We the Best (2007), spawned the hit single ""I'm So Hood"" (featuring T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross and Plies). His two subsequent releases—We Global (2008) and Victory (2010)—both peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200; the latter was supported by the single ""All I Do Is Win"" (featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross), which received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

His fifth studio album and major label debut, We the Best Forever (2011), saw continued commercial success and brought Khaled to mainstream prominence by spawning his first Billboard Hot 100-top ten single, ""I'm on One"" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross and Lil Wayne). His following three albums—Kiss the Ring (2012), Suffering from Success (2013), and I Changed a Lot (2015)—were released to moderate critical and commercial reception.[7] Throughout 2015 and 2016, Khaled gained wider recognition as a public figure due to his social media activity.

His tenth album, Grateful (2017), became his second consecutive number-one album and was preceded by the singles ""I'm the One"" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) and ""Wild Thoughts"" (featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller), which peaked at numbers one and two on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. His eleventh album, Father of Asahd (2019), contained the song ""Higher"" (featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend), which won Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards—Khaled's first Grammy Award win. His eponymous twelfth album (2021) and thirteenth album, God Did (2022), both debuted atop the Billboard 200. The latter's title track (featuring Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend and Fridayy) earned three nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance.

Outside of music, Khaled has gained success as a writer, with his book The Keys featuring on the New York Times Best Seller list.

178,178,lil peep,1712489,262231901,"Lil Peep (born Gustav Åhr) was an American recording artist hailing from Long Island, New York. He was cited as one of the primary artists responsible for the post-emo revival with his style of hip hop which came to be known as emo trap. After a slight delay, his debut album Come over When You're Sober, Pt. 1 was released on August 15, 2017. Due to a possible drug overdose, he passed away on November 15, 2017 (aged 21).

Lil Peep was described as a ""SoundCloud rapper"", and his musical style is considered lo-fi rap or emo-trap. The New York Times defined Åhr as the Kurt Cobain of lo-fi rap and described his music as gloomy and diabolically melodic. Åhr's music generally draws on both southern US rap and the angsty introspection of the rock subgenre post-hardcore.

In 2015, Åhr released his first mixtape, Lil Peep Part One, which generated 4,000 plays in its first week. Shortly thereafter, he released his first extended play, Feelz, and another mixtape, Live Forever.

182,182,freddie gibbs,1053086,77669101,"Freddie Tipton (born June 14, 1982 in Gary, Indiana), better known as Freddie Gibbs, is an American rapper who became popular after being included in XXL Magazine's ten Freshmen of 2010. He was previously signed to Interscope Records before being let go from his deal without an official record being released. He has released five mixtapes since his first in 2005 including Live From Gary, Indiana, Big Bizness, The Miseducation of Freddie Gibbs, midwestgangstaboxframecadillacmuzik and Str8 Killa No Filla. The Str8 Killa EP was released 3rd August. His debut LP Baby-Faced Killa and The Devil's Palace, a collaborative project with The Alchemist, were both released in 2012. He then would go on to release Cold Day in Hell in 2012, and ESGN in 2013. In 2014, Gibbs released Pinata, a collaborative album with producer Madlib, and The Tonite Show, another collaborative album with The World's Freshest. Gibbs newest album Shadow of a Doubt is planned to best released on November 20th via ESGN / EMPIRE.

Hailing from Gary, Indiana, a place whose murder and crime rates have ranked it several times at the top of the ""Most Dangerous Cities"" list, Freddie Gibbs is the true definition of a street survivor. Raised on Gary's east side, Gibbs lived the hard life firsthand in a run-down industrial community plagued with vice and ignored by the establishment. After playing at Ball State on a football scholarship, Gibbs was kicked out of college. Over the next few years he went through court-ordered boot camp, joined and got discharged from the military, and held down a series of 9 to 5 jobs without success. Feeling like the system had failed him, Gibbs turned to hustling; pimping and selling crack out of a local house. Inspired by rappers like UGK, The Geto Boys, and 2Pac, Gibbs started rhyming about his life and the issues facing urban youth in Gary and the countless other impoverished cities just like it.  Gibbs is the first rapper signed to a major label from Gary.

The Steel City's most famous musical residents to date are the Jackson 5, whose name still adorns a marquee on a falling-apart theater in Gary's blighted downtown. His desire to rep the Midwest and his city led Gibbs to start recording mixtapes and pushing them online as well as the streets, where he quickly began garnering fans drawn to his original style, diverse flows, and deeply personal lyrics about his experience as a young black man growing up below the poverty line in a forgotten American city. 

Freddie has worked with respected producers like Madlib, Red Spyda, Just Blaze, Buckwild, the Alchemist, Polow Da Don, and Collipark among many others. Gibbs cites Houston rap and Pac as his major influences, and it shows in his ability to alternate between chillingly tense street stories of violence and laid back comedic tales about women and weed. Ultimately Gibbs shows and proves with his rhymes, which demonstrate the promise of a legend in the making. His skills, wit, and street credibility establish Freddie Gibbs as a true artist. He's ready to represent for Gary, the Midwest, and anyone who relates to the struggle of inner city life. As Gibbs tells it: ""My music is definitely on some gangsta shit. That's what I was raised on and what I witnessed. How can I speak on anything else?""

197,197,lil darkie,552954,41071490,"Joshua Hamilton also known as his stage name ""Lil Darkie'' is a rapper, producer, and artist from Long Beach, California. 

He formally went as ""Brahman"" with a blue character, as he believed the Indian god Kali Ma was blue, after realizing that Kali Ma is portrayed with black skin, he rebranded as Lil Darkie and changed his sound alongside with the new persona. The Brahman period lasted a significant amount of time and even had a Collective before the Collective he has as Darkie named ""Spider Gang"", the Brahman collective was named ""Native Cruiser Records"" or NCR for short, and consisted of early Brahman collaborators and Brahman himself.

Lil Darkie’s music is most noticeable due to his “cartoonish” personality both in his music and on social media. He grew a heavy following online through the app TikTok, with songs such as ""Haha"" and ""Genocide"" being very popular. 

Darkie himself admits that the songs that got him popular are not songs he would make today and is no longer something that fully defines Lil Darkie as a character. With the album release ""The Future Is Dark"", Darkie showed his experimental sound alongside common rap niches.

Though Lil Darkie is very misunderstood with his music; especially with Genocide and Holocaust, the messages within his songs are more hidden and complex to the people who want to assume and hate on him for thinking he is racist and wrongfully using the N-word. Even though the use of the N-word is pretty controversial, on the other hand, him being racist or homophobic, etc. isn't the case whereas in multiple songs or occasions in real life, he is open with his sexuality and his opinions on thinking everyone is equal while using the slur due to not thinking one race can claim the word when everyone shouldn't be divided based on preferences and his argument that is promoted is to only spread positivity even with the outrageous titles that people catch their view on.

It was then that Darkoo knew exactly who and where she wanted to be.
 
Continuing to hone her craft, she exploded onto the scene late 2019 with the anthemic track ‘Gangsta' featuring One Acen, which saw her land her first UK Top 40 hit, peaking at #22. This was quickly followed by singles ‘Juicy’ and ‘Kryptonite’ which created a huge impact on the music scene.
 
Darkoo is the genre-blurring artist who has successfully created a sound that is distinctly her own, blending her international influences to create her own style of Afroswing, highlighting her vibrant and androgynous vocals perfectly.
 
As one of the most talked about artists in the UK right now British Vogue described Darkoo as “..The musician smashing stereotypes with her style and sound.” Her style is something that never goes amiss, often flipping her look from her blonde buzz cut and low slung trousers to flowing hair and slick dresses.

199,199,yo gotti,1099416,9151529,"Mario Mims (born May 19, 1981 in Memphis, Tennessee), better known by his stage name Yo Gotti, is an American rapper signed to Cash Money Records. Formerly known as Lil Yo in the 90's, he released his first album, From Da Dope Game 2 Da Rap Game, in 2000. Since then he has released 2001's Self-Explanatory, 2003's Life, 2006's Back 2 Da Basics, 2008's Cocaine Muzik, 2009's CM2 (Cocaine Muzik 2 hosted by DJ Drama), and The Pyrex King: Street Runnaz Special Edition.

As one of the six epicenters of Southern hip hop, Memphis has always had a thriving underground capable of producing major platinum superstars such as Eightball & MJG, 3-6 Mafia and Project Pat,Skip a.k.a Gianni Booker. All of the above-mentioned artists at one point in time literally dominated the city’s underground rap scene before going on to become national superstars. Next up to bat is Yo Gotti, M-Town’s current underground rap kingpin. Like his namesake John Gotti, the Memphis based rapper has been running the Southern underground scene with an iron fist for the past. Known and respected throughout the South for his skill and finesse on the microphone, Yo Gotti is one the South’s most respected young rappers.
Born Mario Mims, Yo Gotti grew up in the infamous Ridge Crest Apartments in a North Memphis neighborhood called Frazier. His childhood was typical for a poor ghetto youth in the Deep South. Raised in a family of hustlers and exposed to hard times 24 hours a day the Tennessee rap titan soon turned to the only thing that he knew could get him paid, hustling. “Being from the hood things like hustling will come your way,” says Yo Gotti. “Everybody in my family hustled in some kinda way.” Ironically, hustling is what ultimately led Yo Gotti to rapping.
Taking his cue from Memphis rap legends such as Eightball & MJG, Al Kapone, Gangsta Black, Triple 6 Mafia and Kingpin Skinny Pimp, all of whom he lists as influences, Yo Gotti released his own underground tape entitled, Youngster on the Come Up and placed it on consignment at local mom & pop record stores as well as hustling it out the trunk. The tape sold like hotcakes on the street and made Yo Gotti the hottest rapper on the streets of Memphis. From the Dope Game to the Rap Game, Yo Gotti’s sophomore effort sold so well that Select-O-Hits, a local based independent distributor offered him a small deal and the Memphis rapper more than doubled his fan base with absolutely no marketing or promotions. Soon he found himself ranked among the city’s top rappers. In addition to being featured on the cover of Murderdog Magazine along side his idols Kingpin Skinny Pimp and Al Kapone his record From the Dope Game to the Rap Game made the list for the magazine’s top independent record for the year 2000.
Two years later he inked a distribution deal with TVT Records and released the critically acclaimed album Life, which did respectable numbers for an independent label. “It sold about 40 or 50,000, with no promotions or video,” says Yo Gotti. “That record did what it did on its own.” But as the old saying goes when one door is closed another opened. Gotti’s reputation as the king of Memphis continued to spread and that eventually led him to a production deal with Cash Money/Universal records for his group the Block Burnaz. With his TVT sophomore album entitled Back 2 Da Basics, Yo Gotti returns with the same hardcore street flavor that his die-hard fans have come to know and love, only this time around the true king of Memphis has elevated his game a bit. Given the fact that his last record didn’t do the type of big number he’d hope for you’d think that Yo Gotti would switch up his style to reach a larger audience. Right? Wrong! According to Gotti his street credibility with his underground fans means more to him than gold or platinum status.
“The one thing that you have to understand is that when you create a fan base off of street product the last thing you wanna do is disrespect them by changing because of the record companies and stuff like that. When you do that you change what created you. To me it is very important that I keep in tune with the people that helped to sell 40,000 records independently. That’s why I call my record Back 2 Da Basics.”
Produced by DJ Thoomp, Mannie Fresh, Carlos Brody and newcomers Street Tunes, Back 2 Da Basics offers fans a gritty, insider’s view into the real streets of Memphis as seen through the eyes of Yo Gotti. Nowhere is this viewpoint more intense than on “Full Time,” the amped up lead single –and featured in the MTV Films’ Hustle & Flow movie - with a thunderous bass and intoxicating beat that espouses Gotti’s formula to success –hustle full time.
“A lotta cats wanna be a rapper or a street hustler but they don’t wanna put in the time that it takes,” says Yo Gotti. “They want the money and the cars and the girls, but they don’t wanna work hard for it. But to be successful at anything you gotta grind for it.” On the song “Mama We Gone Be Alright,” he waxes introspective by reflecting on all of the hard times that he and his family have suffered through the years and offers her hope-filled words encouragement. “Mama We Gone Be Alright” along with the gripping tune “My Story” emerges as two of the most interesting songs on Back 2 Da Basics. These three titles along with club banging songs like “Shorty” featuring Baby make Back 2 Da Basics one of the best albums of the year. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Yo+Gotti"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Coming through with a soulful set of Southern sing-raps, Rod has developed a groundswell of regional support through a prolific output that includes 3 projects in the last 12 months. After generating millions of streams with breakout singles “Heart On Ice” and “Popular Loner,” both off June 2019’s PTSD project, Rod levels up with Ghetto Gospel, his new project. With heavy use of organic instrumentation, including snaking electric guitars and warm organ swells, Ghetto Gospel gives a proper title to Rod's spiritual and nakedly-emotional blend of rap music, defined by Rod's unique singing ability, able to switch from a bluesy croon to rapid-fire triplets at a moments notice. Featuring the popular new single ""Cuban Links,"" which features an appearance from Ghetto Gospel executive producer Kevin Gates, and the ""Heart On Ice"" (Remix), which features an appearance from Lil Durk, Ghetto Gospel is available everywhere.

Recently Rod Wave was arrested and his height was exposed (5'6 and weighing 350lbs/160kg). This means he has a BMI of 58 and puts him in the morbidly obese section of the BMI scale. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Rod+Wave"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

On January 24, a single titled ""Walkin"", along with a Western-inspired music video directed by Adrian Villagomez, was released. Curry also said the album ""is made up of everything that I couldn't include on Ta13oo or Imperial because I was going through depression and anger issues"", and would take inspiration from traditional hip-hop, drum and bass, trap, poetry, and jazz.

9,9,mau y ricky,164705,2212520,"For the past few years, Mauricio and Ricky Montaner had been busy writing songs for other artists like Thalía, Miguel Bosé, Diego Boneta, Yuridia, Leslie Grace, to name a few, until recently when they decided the songs they were composing would be for their EP titled Arte under the label of Sony Music.

The young duo, Mau y Ricky, sons of music icon Ricardo Montaner, have released the album's first single, ""Voy Que Quemo,"" a song they decided best represents the music that is coming out in the LP, expected to release in July. ""After writing so many songs, it just seemed natural to start recording an album,"" Ricky, 25, tells Billboard, speaking on behalf of the duo since Mau was on vocal rest. ""We have 10 songs and an 11th that is an instrumental track. 'Voy Que Quemo' seemed like the best song to release first, and we're feeling super excited and nervous.""

Mau y Ricky partnered with Latin Grammy winner Julio Reyes Copello to produce their album and credit him for allowing them to grow artistically and teach them about following their intuition. ""We've grown as producers and songwriters, thanks to him. We also learned that the intuition of an artist is so important and it's something that needs to be respected because your intuition will differentiate you from others. We learned to write for ourselves and put out songs that will represent who we are.""

And that's exactly what Mau y Ricky did. They followed their intuition after listening to their song ""Arte"" which was almost going to be pitched to Wisin, but Ricky says, ""It didn't feel right for another artist to sing this song."" Another man they have to thank for guiding them since they started composing at a very young age is their father, who has written hit singles like ""La Cima del Cielo,"" ""Déjame Llorar"" and ""Me Va a Extrañar.""

""We've written songs together, so working with him helps you grow a lot because he's a very hard critic. Every song I've written since I was 8 years old, I'd run it by him and he'd give me feedback. He actually just heard the final product of our album and he loved it, thank God. But the best thing is that he's a fan of ours and we're huge fans of him. Yeah, he's my dad, but I'm a huge Ricardo Montaner fan.""

Besides a new album, Mau y Ricky fans can expect to see them onstage soon as they go out on tour.

He is one of the most well known reggaeton artists in Latin America. His cross over success in the U.S. has given him more exposure to English speaking Reggaeton fans, making him one of the more recognizable faces of Reggaeton along with Daddy Yankee and Tego Calderón. Don Omar's popularity is currently rising and he recently appeared on MTV. Omar is best known for his songs ""Dile"" and ""Dale Don Dale"" from his first album The Last Don and ""Reggaeton Latino"". His songs center around life and love; some examples of these would be ""La Recompenza"" (The Reward), ""Pobre Diabla"" (Poor Devil (fem.)) and ""Aunque te Fuiste"" (Even Though You Left).

His debut album, The Last Don, sold over 350,000 units in South America. Both ""The Last Don"" as the live edition of it have been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Worldwide, The Last Don: Live [CD & DVD] sold over one million copies, according to the official website. His debut single, ""Dale Don Dale"", sold over 100,000 copies in South America.

28,28,natti natasha,306506,4359458,"Natalia Alexandra Gutiérrez, known by her stage name Natti Natasha, is a Dominican reggaeton singer, songwriter, and actress. Hailing from Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Natasha grew up surrounded by endless musical influences and enrolled in Santiago’s School of Fine Arts at the age of seven where she developed her singing abilities, describing her time at the school as “one of the best of her life.” Her studio experience would begin as a teenager when she would record songs as a hobby and later alongside friends.

This all led up to her decision to make the biggest and riskiest move of her life, and that was to move to the United States. She settled in the Bronx, New York, or “the City of the Dreams and Dreamers” for young, aspiring musicians like her at the time. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Natti called the move “one of the craziest moves anyone ever did in her family,” and that she often looks back at the decision and wonders what she was doing. Natti would hop from studio to studio, working without pay, but to her, this was a way to get her name out there. A producer friend from Santiago would soon step in and lend her his New York studio.

Natti’s first-ever break came when icon Don Omar signed her to his record label, the Orfanato Music Group, and the pair would go on to make history for years to come. Their collaborations “Dutty Love,” “Tus Movimientos,” “Perdido en tus Ojos,” and a “Hold Ya” remix with Gyptian made waves across Latin America and introduced the world to future reggaeton royalty. Her debut project, an EP titled “All About Me” was released on March 28, 2012.

Natti would continue to make big career moves throughout the years including her departure from Don Omar’s record label and signing onto Pina Records in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2017 when her big breakout would come once and for all. Not only did she record and release a collaboration titled “Otra Cosa” alongside the legendary Daddy Yankee, but she also released what was arguably the biggest song of 2017. “Criminal” featuring Ozuna became an instant hit upon its release, the music video amassing over 1 billion views in just five months and becoming the most watched music video by a female singer released that year.

2019 saw the release of her much-anticipated debut album, “ilumiNATTI,” on February 15. 15 tracks made up the project with two collaborations in total, “Te Lo Dije'' with Anitta and “Soy Mía” with Kany García. Standout track “La Mejor Version de Mi” would transform into a bachata hit with its remix featuring bachata king Romeo Santos.

Natti’s sophomore album titled “NATTIVIDAD” would be released two years later on September 24, 2021 with 17 tracks featuring several chart-topping collaborators such as Becky G, Maluma, and Prince Royce. The release was followed up by the six-episode docuseries titled “Everybody Loves Natti” which documented her pregnancy and relationship with fiancé Raphy Pina. The series premiered on November 19, 2021 on Amazon Prime Video and was generally well received. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Natti+Natasha"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Cazzu es una artista de música urbana que se caracteriza por haber sido siempre muy voluble.

La trapera estudió cine, y su conocimiento de la estética visual le ha ayudado mucho a la hora de conformar la suya propia. Su estilo es desinhibición en estado puro. Cargada de energía, para dar caña con cada tema.

Cazzu, con temas suaves que invitan a bailar y a moverse, es conocedora de todos esos géneros tan interesantes que conforman el trap argentino. Por ello, la trapera es sin duda una de las reinas del trap latino e internacional.

Se presentó en el panorama con su primer tema Killa. Una canción que sienta unas bases muy claras, una carta de presentación como mujer empoderada, llena de espíritu underground. La artista se ha ganado el respeto de todos los artistas de trap del panorama latino, llegando a colaborar con muchos de ellos.

Sus colaboracion con Bad Bunny, Duki y Khea en LOCA y LOCA REMIX es un himno del trap mundial.

Sin duda, Cazzu, es una artista de pies a cabeza. Su presencia es poderosa y llena de arte propia. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cazzu"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Armed with his lyrical abilities and explosive personality, he is looking to make a name for himself in the ever so popular and growing urban/Latino market, leaving behind his former group of ""La Factoria"". 

His real name is Edgardo Antonio Miranda Beiro, and he was born in Panama City, Panama; on May 3rd, 1982. His passion for music began at the age of 12 with his main musical influence deriving from reggae, dance hall, and ""Reggaeton"", while listening to the pioneers of this genre like Chicho-Man, Nando-Boon, Renato Gaby, and last but not least, El General. 

Upon entering college, he studied Neurological Rehabilitation and Physical Therapy; however, his passion for the music drove him to audition for a local musical production under the direction of the local radio station called FACTORIA .1, under the supervision of Producer ""D.J. Pablito"", giving Joey Montana his first opportunity to record professionally and a major production of various artists. At that point, he began alternating between studying and pursuing a better musical career, and excelled at both. 

Not only was this young artist able to gain a fanbase in his home country, but also in countries like Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico, and England. In the year 2000, DJ Pablito, associated with another producer decided to form a group utilizing the former name of an older production called ""La Factoria"", which consisted of 3 Panamanian artists, one being Joey Montana (formerly known as MC JOE), and his companions, Dempra and Joycee. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Joey+Montana"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

63,63,jossef,41348,314002,"Jossef infuses the Latin urban genre with a combination of universal melody and personal attitude. Born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the singer, songwriter, and artist dropped his debut single “Zumba” at just 17-years-old. Introducing himself as a genre-breaking independent innovator and dynamic performer, he earned his first local hit with “Pa’ Moverse” in 2019. Maximizing this momentum, he popped off worldwide on “Enciéndelo” alongside Ñengo Flow and Jamby El Favo, breaking into the Billboard Latin Rhythm Chart and the Spotify Top 50 Viral (Spain) and cracking 10 million streams and counting in the process. During 2020, Billboard championed him among its “Latin Teen Artists To Keep On Your Radar.” However, he exploded globally on “Persia (Remix)” [with Jamby El Favo and Eix]. Beyond amassing 100 million-plus total streams and landing on Billboard Argentina’s “Hot 100,” it garnered a gold certification in Spain—his first. Claiming real estate on coveted Spotify playlists such as Viva Latino and Baila Reggaeton, he averages over 4.1 million monthly listeners on the platform and has amassed hundreds of millions of cumulative streams. He moved through 2021 rapidly with bangers such as “Sexo Casual,” “A Ley,” and “X2” in advance of his forthcoming full-length debut album. Representing a new generation of Puerto Rican artists, Jossef leads the pack by blazing his own trail. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Jossef"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

64,64,farruko,664829,8395316,"Farruko is a reggaeton and Latin pop singer from Puerto Rico. His given name is Carlos Efren Reyes, and he was born in Bayamon, Puerto Rico in 1991. At the age of 16, he began to post his songs under his stage name to MySpace. His first single, ""Sexo Fuera del Planeta,"" gained thousands of followers, and from there he explored the potential of other social media networks. Due to his massive success on the Internet, he came to the attention of Puerto Rican radio and music industry executives, who enlisted his vocal talents for other artists.

Farruko's debut album, El Talento del Bloque, appeared when he was 18. It was released by Siente Music and distributed by Universal. Most of its 13 songs were self-penned. The set became an almost instant hit, and several singles followed from it. Some of the album's highlights included its collaborative tunes such as ""Su Hija Me Gusta"" with José Feliciano, ""Ella No Es Facil"" with Cosculluela, and ""Traime a Tu Amiga"" with Arcangel and Julio Voltio. He also issued the non-album smash ""Pa Romper la Discoteca"" with Daddy Yankee and Yomo. In 2012, he issued his sophomore offering, TMPR: The Most Powerful Rookie. Its first smash single was ""Feel the Rhythm"" (""Siente el Ritmo""), though it was one of five. As a whole, the set demonstrated that Farruko was as comfortable in electro and pop circles as he was in reggaeton; it was nominated for a Latin Grammy.

After touring throughout Latin America and the United States and establishing large fan bases in locales such as Venezuela and Colombia, he returned to recording in 2014. Farruko Presenta los Menores was released in late October of that year. A week after its release, it topped the Latin Albums chart. Among the notable collaborations are ""Salgo"" with Arcangel, Ñengo Flow, D. Ozi, and Genio y Kelmitt; ""Bebe Conmigo"" with J. Balvin; and ""Interesada"" with Luigi 21+. He won the Premios Juventud for the song ""6 AM"" with J. Balvin and Latin Grammy Awards for Best Urban Performance and Best Urban Song in 2015. In February of that year, he released ""Lejos de Aquí,"" a remix with Yandel. In June, he was Alejandra Guzman's surprise duet partner on her first urban single, ""Adios."" In July, he issued the pre-release track ""Sunset"" (featuring Shaggy and Nicky Jam), which garnered the top spot on various Latin airplay charts. In August, Farruko issued The Ones, a compilation of his charting singles and collaborations; it was a teaser for his next studio effort, Visionary, which appeared in late October. Pre-order excitement for the album propelled it to debut at number one on several Latin album charts; it remained there for several weeks after release. In 2017, he returned with his sixth studio album, Trapficante. As its title suggested, the artist put his money on the fusion of reggaeton and pop urban with the second generation of Latin trap, the latter he considered still in its infancy, making some commercial inroads but still far from its future force as the face of commercial mainstream Latin X pop -- despite its outlaw ties. He openly desired being the face of that future and drew on a host of new generation Latin trap artists as collaborators including Frank Miami, Sharo Torres, Rome, Mambo Kingz, DJ Luian, Maffio, Lil Geniuz, Bad Bunny, and Ladkani. The album was issued in September as Farruko undertook the U.S. leg of his global TrapXFicante tour. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Farruko"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

67,67,piso 21,271843,4689866,"Juan David Castaño (el llanero), David Escobar (Dim), Juan David Huertas (El profe) y Pablo Mejía (Pablito), son los integrantes del grupo que ahora suena en las emisoras de la ciudad de medellin, Piso 21.

El mayor tiene solo 26 años y el menor 21. Son jóvenes, sí, pero ya son conscientes de su éxito y más que un grupo, ellos se consideran una familia, pues lo más importante, antes de cantar, es la unión y la lealtad a su amistad.

Todo comenzó en junio del año 2007 cuando se conocieron en un asado que organizó un amigo que tenían en común. Conversando se dieron cuenta de que los cuatro eran músicos y terminaron cantando hasta las 6 de la mañana.

Días después El Profe buscó a Dim y al Llanero y les propuso formar un grupo, pero Dim dijo que sí con la condición de que también incluyeran a Pablito, quien estaba de viaje en ese momento en Contadora, Panamá.

Fue tanta la emoción y la ansiedad por crear el grupo que inmediatamente llamaron a Pablito a Panamá y el aceptó sin dudarlo.

Paso a paso
Su segundo encuentro, o mejor dicho su primer ensayo, fue en el club house de un amigo del edificio San Mitchel, en el piso 21, desde donde se podía ver la ciudad d medellin completa. Este se convirtió durante varios meses en su ensayadero oficial y era allí donde pasaban noches enteras montando las canciones.

""Durante esas noches soñábamos con que algún día escucharían nuestras composiciones en todas esas casa que veíamos desde allá"", cuenta Dim.

""Y creo que lo estamos logrando, pero ahora la idea es que también nos escuchen en aquellas de las que solo veíamos la luz, arriba en las montañas"", continúa El Profe.

Su nombre
A la hora de pensar en cómo se llamarían, dieron muchas vueltas y hasta lo consultaron con sus familias y sus profesores.

Al principio le buscaron por el lado de sus iniciales o pensaron en jugar un poco con los nombres de David y Pablo, pero luego de intentarlo por muchos lados, se les ocurrió Piso 21, pues fue a esta altura donde realmente conformaron el grupo.

Pero a este nombre también le han encontrado una metáfora, pues según ellos, indica que para arriba es adonde quieren llegar, dando pasos lentos, pero seguros y muy largos.

Precisamente antes de empezar cada concierto, el grupo se reúne para gritar su frase favorita ""Piso 21, vamos pa'arriba papá"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Piso+21"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

74,74,abraham mateo,133476,1965315,"Abraham Mateo (born in San Fernando (Cadiz), Spain on August 25, 1998) is a Spanish teen actor and pop singer. Abraham was discovered in 2009, when he was ten, by producers of the record label EMI Music Spain, who happened across Abraham's videos in Youtube and his multiple performances in the television show Menuda Noche on the Canal Sur TV of Andalucia, Spain. His self-titled debut album, Abraham Mateo, was released in Spain in December 2009. The album was produced by the spanish composer and producer Jacobo Calderon, who has worked before with internationally recognized latin singers such as Raphael, David Bisbal, and Luis Fonsi.

Beginnings

In 2006, when he was seven, he sang for the first time in public at the regional music competition for children ""Veo Veo"" organized by the Teresa Rabal Foundation in Andalucia, being awarded with a special mention of the jury. Two years later, he won the revelation award at the national music contest held in Murcia being selected to represent Spain at the ""Veo veo"" international competition. 

In 2005, Abraham auditioned for the television show ""Menuda Noche"" on the Canal Sur TV of Andalucia but was not cast for the show. Two years later he attended ""Menuda Noche"" to support his older brother Tony Mateo, who has been chosen to sing in the show, but Abraham was surprised by the show's presenter Juan y Medio and sang in place of his brother. Since then, Abraham has been a frequent guest of ""Menuda Noche"" singing in front of internationally recognized latin singers such as Raphael, David Bisbal, David Bustamante, and Juan Luis Guerra, who have praised Abraham for his strong vocal abilities and stage presence. Raphael said about him: ""That's singing without imitating anyone! You are a great singer!"", David Bustamante: ""You sing like the angels! Impressive! I think he is unique!"", and David Bisbal: ""I have no words! He has a wonderful technique, a very nice voice and a nice tessitura! I predict a huge success!"".

First album

Since his first appearances in ""Menuda Noche"", a friend of Abraham's family posted in Youtube videos of his performances, which soon enjoyed great popularity and caught the attention of producers of EMI Music Spain. Early 2009, when he was ten, he signed a contract with EMI Music Spain and released in December of the same year his debut album, recorded in Madrid, under the title Abraham Mateo.

The album produced by Jacobo Calderon and Jose Luis de la Peña contains twelve songs, seven of them were composed by Calderon himself and four tracks are covers of popular latin songs such as Raphael's ""Cuando tu no estas"" (""When you are not here""), Alejandro Sanz's ""Los dos cogidos de la mano"" (""The two holding hands""), Laura Pausini's ""La soledad"" (""La solitudine/The loneliness"") and Luis Fonsi's ""Imaginame sin ti"" (""Imagine me without you""). The album includes a duet with the french teen singer Caroline Costa, the runner-up in the 2008 edition of the television contest Incroyable Talent, the french version of America's Got Talent. Abraham and Caroline recorded for the album a spanish version of Badfinger's ""Without you"", the song has also been covered with great success by Mariah Carey. To promote the album, Abraham has toured through several cities in Spain and performed in many spanish radio and television shows, including the popular television programs Mas que baile, Tu si que vales, the show of Maria Teresa Campos, and the Christmas Eve Special of the Telecinco channel. He was also invited to perform at the International Carnival Maspalomas in Gran Canaria.

In summer 2010, he recorded his first song in english, a cover version of the Celine Dion hit I surrender.

Acting

Abraham acted in the TV movies ""Días sin Luz"" (2009) and ""Raphael: una historia de superacion personal"" (2010) both produced by Antena 3 Films and broadcasted by the spanish television channel Antena 3. In the biopic ""Raphael: una historia de superacion personal"", he portrayed the worldwide acclamed spanish singer Raphael in the early years of his career and sang some of the vocal tracks.

85,85,dj nelson,78981,519685,"Nelson Díaz Martinez (born on April 7, 1972 in San Juan, Puerto Rico), known artistically as DJ Nelson is a DJ/producer who played a significant role in the development and popularization of reggaeton.[1] He first made a name for himself as part of the Noise, a club-centered collective that was spawned in 1992. The Noise—composed of DJs, MCs, producers, and club coordinators—hosted a long-lasting series of club nights in San Juan that were vital to the development and popularization of reggaeton. DJ Nelson earned credit as one of the top Noise DJs, and he also served as a producer/arranger for the collective's music.

In 1997 he made his CD debut, Nel-Zone, which was split into respective reggae and rap mixes, and he also was credited on a couple other CD releases that year: Don Chezina's Bien Guillao de Gangster and Ivy Queen's En Mi Imperio (1997). From this point forward, DJ Nelson began focusing on his solo career, primarily as a producer, with notable credits including Ivy Queen's The Original Rude Girl (1998) and Wisin & Yandel's Los Reyes del Nuevo Milenio (2000). His mixtape-style productions continued as well, with Undertrack Collection (2000) and Music (2001), the latter of which marked the advent of his personal brand, Flow Music.
DJ Nelson signed to this label a trio of young, up-and-coming producers: Francisco Saldaña, Víctor Cabrera, Norgie Noriega, the former two of whom are better known as Luny Tunes, of course, while the latter goes by just Noriega. These three producers pooled their talents together for Mas Flow (2003), a mixtape album that was groundbreaking in terms of popularity and influence. Numerous volumes followed, except without Noriega, who went the solo route, debuting with Contra la Corriente (2004). DJ Nelson continued with his own career as well, releasing Flow la Discoteka (2004) and opening a club of the same name, at which he was the resident DJ. In addition, he is credited with having set up The Mix 107.7, a popular Puerto Rican radio station hosted by DJ Coyote, and he even took his brand into the clothing industry, forming Flow Wear. Released in 2007, Flow la Discoteka, Vol. 2 featured his biggest hit single to date, ""Pasarela"", performed by Dalmata. DJ Nelson, Gerardo Cruet and Arcangel, consider themselves as pioneers in the new ""urban movement"", a sub-genre of reggaeton and hip-hop, Electro-Flow. Electro-Flow as Arcangel baptized it, is a blend of Hip-hop, reggaeton, dance-hall, electronica, and other futuristic sounds. Electro-flow can be heard in the songs. ""Chica Virtual"", ""Pa Que la Pases Bien"", ""Te Estoy Buscando"". ""Sexy Movimiento"", ""Siguelo"", ""Dame un Poquito"" by Wisin y Yandel. ""Veo Veo"" by Yaga y Mackie Ranks. Also ""Let's Do It"" ""No te Veo"" all are considered Electro-flow. Some songs lean more towards dance Hip Hop while some lean more towards Reggaeton depending on the song. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Nelson"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Carrera

Wos arrancó desde muy pequeño rapeando en las plazas y participando en competencias como El Quinto Escalón, donde ya demostraba un gran potencial y sobre todo mucho coraje. Pero fue en 2016 cuando demostró que su nivel estaba para mucho más que una plaza, ganando así varias fechas del Quinto Escalón, tirando acotes memorables, que se viralizaron mucho en las redes sociales y salió campeón de la fecha final, dejando en el camino a Dtoke en la primera ronda y derrotando en la final a Klan. Wos es uno de los que más veces logró ganar la competencia de El Quinto Escalón.

En el 2017 participó en la Final Nacional Red Bull Batalla de los Gallos por primera vez, donde salió campeón derrotando, entre otros, a Papo, uno de los candidatos en los Cuartos de final y a Klan en la final y así se clasificó a la Internacional que se llevó a cabo en México en la cual quedó segundo detrás de Aczino.

También participó en otras competencias como la Double AA que ganaría en Argentina. En la Red Bull Batalla de los Gallos Internacional 2018 se coronó campeón. En FMS Argentina 2018 Wos también salió victorioso después de ganarle en la final a Papo. También tuvo un papel protagonista en la película Las Vegas dirigida por Juan Villegas.

Actualmente en 2019 anunció su retiro de la FMS para desviar su atención a su carrera musical, sin embargo seguirá activo en otras competencias, como por ejemplo GodLevel, en la cual represento a Argentina junto a Papo y Trueno en la que quedaron subcampeones, y la final internacional de Red Bull 2019.

Santi Balmes, the writer, main composer, and charismatic leader brings to each album excellent lyrics of high composition, from a delicious sense of humour to deep emotional tales. Their first three albums are sung in English, but their more acclaimed album is Maniobras de Escapismo (2005), the first sung in Spanish. With ""Cuentos Chinos Para Niños Del Japón"" (2007) they confirm again the band in the scene.
In 2009 (March 24) , they publish ""1999 (o como generar incendios de nieve con una lupa enfocada a la luna)"" a concept album that tells, 10 years later, the life of a relationship between a boy and a girl during 1999 (the year of their first album). It includes songs to dance to, to listen to in intimacy or just to think about.
Videoclips are another face of the LOL experience;  the first video of ""1999..."" is ""Club de fans de John Boy""  and the second one is ""Te hiero mucho (Historia del amante guisante)"" both directed by the influent director Lyona, who also directed ""Universos Infinitos"" from ""Cuentos chinos para niños del Japón"".

53,53,vendredi sur mer,362603,5260821,"From Geneva, Switzerland, although her nationality is usually defined as Franco-Swiss. Her name is Charline Mignot, but artistically she is known as Vendredi sur Mer.

Coming into the world in the mid 90's, Charline grows up with a very introverted view of the world around her. As she grew up and wanted to explain her surroundings in her own way, she moved more and more towards the arts, fashion and photography, and it is in the latter that she dedicated her studies.

In his quest to make his own mark and push his own boundaries within the aesthetics he used for his photographs, he eventually started writing songs. The first time was with the idea of using self-made music for her photo shoots, knowing that music would help set the mood within the shoot. That's how her first song, ""Est-ce que tu t'en souviens"", was created.

Their style is quite distinctive, having been described as dream-pop, electro-pop, electro-ambient and even ""space-disco"". The marriage of Charline's art and direction caught the attention of Swiss and French producers, including Lewis Ofman, who produced her most listened-to single, ""La femme á la peau bleue"", in 2016, a song that became famous in the fashion world as the official music for one of Sonia Rykiel's 2017 collections.

Mignot's voice is always soft, as if she were singing from a reverie. She uses a spoken voice in all her songs, which come across best as storytelling about women, sensuality, love and heartbreak. In some interviews she has expressed frustration at being associated with radical feminism just because her music is about women, ""as if it's something abnormal or radicalised for a woman to write about women instead of men"", so she often says that she goes between one gender and the other, to create confusion among listeners.

Vendredi sur Mer's first EP came out in 2017 and is called ""Marée basse"", the only studio album she has released to date is called ""Premiers émois"" and was released in 2019 with the single ""Chewing-Gum"".

54,54,fkj,699524,12333792,"French Kiwi Juice, or FKJ for short, is the moniker of Vincent Fenton, a nod to his Gallic mother and New Zealander father. He grew up in a small French village outside of Tours, isolated from his friends, and so he turned to music for company. He got hooked on his parents’ records by Pink Floyd, Billie Holliday, Nina Simone and Queen, and took up guitar; then, aged seven, the saxophone. “I would play with whatever toys were around, and that helped develop my imagination, and then that evolved into making instruments – I found whatever I could and started putting it together,” he said of his rudimentary one-man bands. 

That one-man-band mentality has persisted, collecting instruments as he goes, though he’s never been formally trained; instead developing his own ear. Prestigious music colleges were too expensive and so he eventually moved to Paris to study the sound and film, which helped give him grounding in cinematic arrangements. He fell into the city’s nightlife scene, playing live instruments in clubs in Paris, and became known as a Soundcloud producer who blended house and jazz, as on his vibey 2013 Time For A Change EP. 

But then in 2015, he played a festival in the Philippines that changed everything. There he met June, who performs as ((( O )))) and who he’d remixed a track for. Eventually they got married and moved in together on an island off the country’s south coast, where they have created a tropical studio idyll that looks out onto lush rainforest. You can see it in the live session FKJ recorded there in 2019 (over 19m views on YouTube), as he flits between piano, singing and sax.

The seeds for his more introspective sound were sown with his 2017 self-titled debut, while the track that he did with Masego that same year, ‘Tadow’, further evidenced his effortless ear for intriguing rhythms – the pair made the hip-hop-speared jazz jam out of a day-long improvisation in Paris, duelling on their saxophones, their keyboards and drums interlocking effortlessly. There’s an ease to his collaborations – nothing forced; artists who are like-minded about being guided by groove – see the meeting of minds on the track “Risk’ with the American rapper Bas or his latest remix for PinkPantheress. 

But in 2019, FKJ started drawing more from within. He released the Ylang Ylang EP, the result of a tumultuous and devastating year when June miscarried. The couple cancelled their commitments and holed up together to recuperate and make music. The sweepingly romantic jazz of the title track is the EP’s centrepiece, encircled by crisp R&B beats, acoustic guitar flourishes and ambitious sax instrumentals on the other songs. The making of it soothed them as much as it did his growing international fanbase. “With music, I feel safe,” he says. “So when I hear that my music is healing for people, it’s the best compliment.” 

Back in the Philippines, with no wifi and an impending global lockdown, FKJ was quite literally cut off from the world, able to explore music’s endless possibilities. “Sometimes I would get into it for the whole night and go to bed when the sun came up.” Out of this freedom comes an expressionistic, touching album that’s impossible to pin down. There’s no more hiding behind a branch of leaves, as he did on the cover of his 2017 debut: V I N C E N T marks FKJ out as a crucial new voice. He’s redefining chillout music with his bursts of late-night jazz sax and piano, coupled with his wood-cabin whispery vocals, recalling Bon Iver’s early work, and those Santana-styled guitar flourishes. 

V I N C E N T is a marvel – and testament to the magic that can happen when you dig deep. “This was a challenging record,” he says. “I’m a perfectionist and it’s hard to shake that off. But once I did, and I let the music take over, I felt totally free.” <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/FKJ"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

55,55,the black keys,3005321,170192675,"The Black Keys is an alternative rock  group from Akron, Ohio, United States which formed in 2001, consisting of singer and guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney. The band name was inspired by a schizophrenic artist and friend in Akron, who used the term ""black keys"" to describe things he disliked or people he did not trust. The Black Keys have roots in traditional blues and psychedelic rock stylings.

They released their first album, The Big Come Up, in 2002, followed by Thickfreakness in 2003, and Rubber Factory in 2004. October 2005 saw the release of the DVD Live, recorded live at The Metro Theatre in Sydney, Australia March 18, 2005. In 2006 they released Magic Potion, as well as the lesser-known Chulahoma and a single version of Your Touch.

One of their trademarks is their preference for simple, lo-fi recording techniques. They refuse to use big-name studios, and do most recording, producing, and mixing themselves. Most of Thickfreakness was recorded in about 14 hours in Carney's basement, using only an early 80's Tascam 388 8-track recorder. Often, their recordings still have background noises (such as an owl hooting).

The Black Keys have achieved increasing critical acclaim and recognition since their debut album, which itself received praise from Rolling Stone magazine. Time magazine named them one of the ""10 Best Acts of 2003"" (behind OutKast and The White Stripes). They have supported a number of bands: they toured with Sleater-Kinney in 2003, had a short stint opening for Beck, have recently opened for Radiohead on the American leg of their brief 2006 tour, and performed at Lollapalooza in 2005 and 2007. In addition to this, they were also well-liked by influential British radio DJ John Peel and appeared on both Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Late Show with David Letterman. Famous followers of the band include Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead, and Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammet. Matt Helders, drummer for the Arctic Monkeys, can be seen in a Black Keys T-Shirt in an interview on MTV's RAW. 

Their song ""When the Lights Go Out"" was featured in the 2007 film Black Snake Moan, and also on the soundtrack for that movie. The Black Keys were included in the soundtrack of the 2003 movie School of Rock with their song, ""Set You Free"". ""Lies"" was featured in the conclusion of the February 4, 2009 episode of Lie to Me. One of their songs, ""Girl Is on My Mind"", was used in a 2006 Sony Ericsson advertisement, starring the tennis players Ana Ivanović and Daniela Hantuchová, gaining the band more commercial recognition. It was also used in a 2006 Victoria's Secret commercial featuring Heidi Klum and could be heard in the movies Rest Stop and Cashback. Their song ""10 am Automatic"" was used in the video game MLB '06: The Show, The O.C., The Go-Getter, and was also used in a 2007 American Express commercial starring Shaun White. ""Your Touch"" was featured in a 2007 Lee's jeans commercial, and can be heard both in an episode of NBC's Friday Night Lights and in an episode of ""Eastbound and Down"". Their cover ""Grown So Ugly"" can be heard in the background of the going away party in the 2007 film Cloverfield. ""Strange Times"" is used in Grand Theft Auto IV on the in-game radio station Radio Broker. ""Strange Times"" can also be heard during a preview for ABC's The Mole, and the trailer for season three of the Showtime series Dexter, as well as a promo for Gossip Girl. Their song ""Just Got To Be"" is used on the soundtrack for the video game NHL 08, and ""Hard Row"" is featured in the premiere episode of the FX show Sons of Anarchy. Sons of Anarchy has gone on to use ""Keep Me"" in both Episodes 6 and 7, as well as ""Busted"" in episode 7. The song ""Lies"" is featured in the advertising campaign for the third season of HBO's Big Love. ""The Breaks"" can be heard in Guy Ritchie' film RocknRolla. ""Your Touch"" can also be heard in the HBO series ""Entourage"" in the episode ""Manic Monday"", during the opening scenes. The song ""Psychotic Girl"" is featured the episode ""Messin' with the Kid"" in season 6 of One Tree Hill. ""I'll Be Your Man"" is the opening theme song for the HBO show Hungand was also featured in an episode of the FX Network show Rescue Me. ""Your Touch"" can also be heard in the film Zombieland and in an episode of ""Eastbound and Down"" on HBO. The song ""I Got Mine"" has been used in HBO's sports reality series 24/7 Pacquiao-Hatton"" [13] as well as background music for the 2009 American League Championship Series. The song ""Next Girl"" is featured in the in game radio of Saints Row the Third.

Their fourth record that Danger Mouse produced Attack & Release  was out April 1st 2008. The duo's fifth album is the first one recorded in a proper studio.

The Band's fifth album, ""Brothers"" was released in spring 2010 and has seen increasing amounts of exposure to the ""Dancing T-Rex"" video for the song ""Tighten Up"" that went viral...until the band asked it to be removed because they felt it made light of their music.

The track ""Tighten Up"" was also used as the background music for a Subaru Legacy commercial and on the FIFA 2011 Soundtrack.

The Black Keys' seventh studio album, ""El Camino,"" was released on the 6th of December 2011. Co-produced by Danger Mouse, the album was released to critical acclaim, receiving positive reviews from The Rolling Stones, NME and more. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly commented on ""El Camino"", saying that ""El Camino trades the soulful stylings of Brothers for harder-driving, faster-riffing rock & roll"". At the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, El Camino won the award for Best Rock Album, while ""Lonely Boy"" received multiple honors, taking 'Best Rock Performance' and 'Best Rock Song'. The album has sold 1.4 million copies in the United States to date.

She made her television debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on February 15, 2017, Saturday Night Live debut on November 3, 2018 and Today Show debut on July 12, 2019.

She cites Carrie Brownstein, Patti Smith, Kim Gordon, and Björk as her musical inspirations, while prominent singers Brandi Carlile and Sharon Van Etten - who she calls her ""musical big sisters"" - have become mentors. She also mentioned in her initial conversation with Williams that she has synesthesia, a benign condition where one or more senses is perceived at once. In her case, she is able to perceive colours as a response to hearing music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Maggie+Rogers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band consists of John Vaughan on lead vocals and guitar, Ben Lapps on drums, and Matt Alvarado on bass. They formed in 2008, initially starting as a songwriting duo with Vaughan and Lapps before Alvarado joined to complete the current lineup of Public.

Drawing inspiration from their roots in classic rock and indie pop, Public released their first EP titled ""Red"" in 2012, quickly establishing a strong local fanbase in Cincinnati. Their energetic performances and infectious sound caught the attention of renowned acts like Walk the Moon, Twenty One Pilots, and Young the Giant, leading to opportunities for the band to support these artists on tour. Public also made appearances at notable festivals including Forecastle, Bunbury, CMJ, and SXSW, exposing them to diverse crowds and expanding their reach.

Following their second EP release, ""Let's Make It,"" and a national tour supporting Walk the Moon, Public ventured to Los Angeles, California, to collaborate with producer Eric Palmquist (known for his work with Mars Volta and Bad Suns). Immersed in a new creative environment and drawing from their experiences on the road, the band embraced alternative and pop influences, resulting in the creation of their 2015 single, ""Heartbeating."" The release coincided with their national tour alongside Oh Honey and received favorable recognition from respected blogs such as Kings of A&R and Good Music All Day, which praised Public's harmonies and captivating indie style.

In 2019, Public experienced a breakthrough with their single ""Make You Mine."" Originally self-released in 2015, the song gained significant traction after going viral on TikTok, accumulating over 2.5 million TikTok videos featuring the track. The band's success on the platform and their partnership with Jonas Group Entertainment, headed by Kevin Jonas Sr., caught the attention of major record labels. In July 2019, Public signed with Island Records.

Following their signing, Public released a new version of ""Make You Mine"" that was mixed by Grammy Award winners Chris Lord-Alge and mastered by Emily Lazar. The track became a sensation on TikTok, reaching the number four spot on the trending charts and accumulating over 7 million streams per week. To date, ""Make You Mine"" has garnered over 260 million streams. On May 8, the group released their new single ""Honey in the Summer,"" a breezy laid-back love song co-written and produced by John Fields. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Public"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Her solo work is raga-inspired, psychedelic music, using guitar strings as basic sound material and sound effects as an instrument. Home-made one string bass stick used to produce low bell-like sounds out of an horror movie. Most tracks have vocals, usually strangely deformed through effect pedals. Track editing and cueing is kept to a minimum in the DIY, abrupt tradition, giving freshness to the music.

Weyes Blood has existed since at least 2006, starting as a conventional folk singer in an unamplified universe, then transforming into a more a crouched/hieroglyphic electronic chasm style, culminating in a European tour with Axolotl. After two seasons of hibernation and a relocation to Baltimore, she materialized her evolution and began writing/playing the darkly haunted narcotic drifter ballads that make up ""The Outside Room"", her first official full-length. The entire album was recorded, mixed and produced by Mering herself, then mastered by good friend Graham Lambkin. The record has shadows of ""The Shadow Ring"" in the oddly creaking ambient sounds and stark, nuanced production, which lend the eerily beautiful folk laments à la Nico. There’s still echoes of her old drone / tape-ghost-clouds moods on tracks like ""In the Isle of Agnitio"" and the long, bells-laden outro to ""Romneydale"", but the bulk of the LP is swooning and sweeping, with Natalie’s gorgeous, quasi-Teutonic vox leading the way. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Weyes+Blood"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band started when Josh, having heard of local drummer Juice Welch, introduced himself and asked if he wanted to start a band. They immediately started working on arrangements for some of Josh's songs. Later Josh met lead guitarist and vocalist Jonas Swanson while waiting in line for an open mic at the Velour in Provo city. Neither of them got on the list to play that night, so they sat on a park bench outside the venue and played their songs to each other until they ran out of stuff to play. Josh invited Jonas to come down and play with him and Juice. It was that night that Out of Tune, a song Josh had been holding onto since he was 16, came to life when they arranged it as a group.   In spring of 2018 the band began recording together. They released their self produced EP Elevator Days on June 3, 2018 and played their first show a few short weeks after.  They released their first full length LP, When We Were Friends on January 27th, 2019.   The group is currently writing new material that they say is a product of the co-writing chemistry that has grown between Jonas & Joshua since their friendship began. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Backseat+Lovers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

70,70,vansire,1435614,31203543,"Vansire is a dream pop band from Rochester, Minnesota consisting of Josh Augustin and Sam Winemiller. They are currently signed to Spirit Goth Records. Vansire has performed at ROCKChester and First Avenue, played a live session with Audiotree, and collaborated with artists such as Chester Watson, Jeremiah Jae, and Mick Jenkins.

Vansire formed as band members Josh Augustin (vocals, synths, guitar, and drums) and Sam Winemiller (bass, guitar, and synths) were attending Century High School in Rochester, Minnesota. Augustin and Winemiller met while playing together on the school's drumline and continued to find themselves performing together through school activities (such as concert band and pit orchestra), something the duo says contributed to their creative synergy and friendship, which later helped in Vansire's formation.

In the summer of 2015, Winemiller approached Augustin after practice for the school's drumline with an idea to make a band ""that sounds like Mac [DeMarco]"". The pair's early recordings were made by holding instruments to the internal microphone of an iPad running GarageBand. Augustin and Winemiller, initially unsure of what to call their new project, turned to an online random word generator that landed on ""vansire"", an alternative name for the Marsh mongoose. From there, the two continued to record together in their basements, living rooms, and bedrooms under the new Vansire moniker.

In August 2016, Vansire self-released their first album, ""Reflections and Reveries"". The duo recorded the album entirely in Winemiller's basement in a roughly one-year period from August 2015 to August 2016, and included Winemiller's brother, Issac, on bass for some songs.

During this time, Augustin began studying at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and Oberlin College, while Winemiller started at the University of Minnesota. Despite the distance, the duo vowed to remain committed to the Vansire project, now describing it as ""a long-distance band relationship.""

Vansire released their second album Angel Youth in April 2018 on Spirit Goth Records. Augustin and Winemiller produced and mastered the album themselves, and it is the band's first full-length album that featured collaborations with other artists.

In June 2019, the duo released their single ""Metamodernity"", also recording an Audiotree Live session at Audiotree's studios in Chicago later that August.

In July 2020, Vansire released ""Central Time"", a single featuring Chicago-based rapper Mick Jenkins in their first collaboration together. In an interview announcing the single, Augustin said the single began as an instrumental demo that Winemiller sent him in September 2019, which sat untouched for roughly eight months until the duo returned back to it, finishing it up at the beginning of June 2020.

During this period of the band's history, Augustin said that Vansire found itself leaning in an ""increasingly dance-oriented direction"" with regard to musical sound and that the duo has started to draw influence from more ""dancey, funk-imbued music"".

On October 16, 2020, Vansire released ""After Fillmore County"", a seven-song EP that brought back FLOOR CRY, and featured Philadelphia-based rapper Ivy Sole. In April 2021, Vansire released a remix of Sydney-based producer-artist Swaine Delgado's ""F Me Up"", their first remix. In May 2022, Vansire released their third LP, The Modern Western World"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Vansire"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

71,71,leisure,409666,5314164,"There are five artists with the name Leisure:

1) LEISURE is a band from New Zealand that launched on SoundCloud in 2015 with 'Got It Bad.'  https://soundcloud.com/theleisurecollective

Made up of five independently talented and successful members who were looking for a new creative outlet unconstrained by over-thinking, over-planning, and excessive control; LEISURE are an anomaly in the music industry. This unusual melting-pot of contributions means LEISURE is greater than the sum of its parts, each member bringing different influences from 70s funk, to 90s rap and R&B, all the way to dance music from the early 2000s. Each member also brings a different skill set – strong pop song writing sensibilities, experimental production techniques, and the talent to mix and master their own work.

Having amassed over 60 million streams on their debut album, which entered at #2 in the NZ charts, they have built a rabid fan following that has seen their very occasional live shows sell out and become the stuff of legends – recently performing their debut, backed by the 72-piece Auckland Philharmonic Orchestra, to a sold-out Auckland Town Hall.

Their music has become a staple in the sync world, they have collaborated with hip-hop star, Goldlink, and have now signed globally to US / UK record label Nettwerk for their forthcoming album.

Their self-titled debut album release was critically acclaimed and with their sophomore album complete, fans worldwide continue to connect with their manifesto of living the good life, and their over-riding code to “keep things LEISURE”.

2) Leisure is a band from Boston, MA consisting of Jed Rouhana, Sam Hamad, and Chris Link. The three members played in bands together since High School. In 2010, they gave a demo CD to JR White of the San Francisco band Girls, during one of Girls' Boston shows. The CD included ""It's Alright (On The Suez Canal)"". White subsequently invited Leisure to open on their US tour. After touring, Leisure began work on their debut album ""Plastic Soul"", which they self-produced. The album is set to be released in 2012. More information can be found on their official website,www.leisureofficial.com and facebook page, www.facebook.com/leisuremusic

3) Leisure featured Middle Class Rut hitmakers Zack Lopez and Sean Stockham and a rotating cast of singers. The earliest incarnation of the band, which included D. Scott Sault, who would later front the short-lived Atlantic Records act Quitter, self-released an EP, Polygraph Alliance, in 1999. After Sault's departure the band briefly included Die Trying (Island) frontman Jassen Jensen. The band eventually landed a deal with Dreamworks, then fronted by Darren, and, shortly thereafter, at least briefly, ex-Hotwire frontman Rus Martin stepped in. The band's one and only national tour was opening for CKY. No word on if an album was ever completed, though several demos, some more impressive (""Deathtrap"") than others, do exist. 

4) Leisure was formed 1998 in New York City. They play non-Britpop and sing about faith, hope and love. Drew sings/play guitar, Peter plays keys/sings, Steve plays bass and Ted plays guitar/sings. They had recorded 2 EP’s (Occasional Music 1.0 & 2.0) with SoundOptik (Ryan Adams, The Strokes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion), Jesse Sprinkle (Poor Old Lu, Serene UK, Starflyer 59) and Andrew D. Prickett (The Violet Burning, Cush, The Prayer Chain). Their music can be heard on XM Satellite Radio.

5) Leisure is still a young band but has some experience however. Formed in November 2004 with the idea of playing only covers. In view of the result of exalting rehearsals, the band decided quickly, under the impulse of Francois, the bands songwriter, to create a set entirely made of their own compositions. The band chose clearly its style, under the British influence and sensitive to each decade (from The Beatles, the Kinks to The Libertines as well as Oasis). Leisure is made up of five members : a drummer with a heavy strike (Nessim, 23), a bassist who gives a certain feminine touch to the band (Coralie, 19), a rhythmical thorough guitarist (Nicolas, 22), a soloist gifted guitarist (Francois, 21) and a charismatic singer (Siamack, 20). The year 2005 has meant toil for the band, accumulating compositions and hours of intensive rehearsals. The band performed at that time in the main venues of Bordeaux, like lInca, lAssonette, la Centrale and some open air gigs like the participation to the festival « Tête de lArt ». At the end of the year, Leisure recorded his first demo called « Shoots in the Streets », recorded and mixed by Kim, produced by the band itself and containing five of their songs played live. The year 2006 is promising for the band which had the honor to play in renowned places such as lHeretic et le SonArt, still improving their set on stage and their compositions. They were also broadcasted several times on radios, like Radio Sauvagine (94.9 FM). After having had the ambition to be known in Bordeaux, the band thinks of exporting itself little by little in whole France. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Leisure"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

75,75,the national,2334837,195211101,"The National is an indie rock band formed in 1999, by friends from Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. The band's lyrics are written and sung by Matt Berninger in a distinctive, deep baritone. The rest of the band is composed of two pairs of brothers: Aaron Dessner (guitar, bass, keyboards), Bryce Dessner (guitar), Scott Devendorf (bass, guitar) and Bryan Devendorf (drums). 

Their self-titled debut album""The National"" (Brassland 2001) was recorded and released before they had played even a single show. They cut the album with engineer Nick Lloyd and formed a label with writer Alec Bemis, so those recordings could be released. Kerrang! magazine gave it four Ks, calling it ""the stuff underground legends are made of.""

The National made a second album, ""Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers"" (Brassland/Talitres 2003). The staff was the same, though Peter Katis, who produced ""Turn on The Bright Lights"" and ""Antics"" by Interpol, helped produce and mix, and Australian composer Padma Newsome from Clogs collaborated on arrangements and strings.

Following the first session of several for Bernard Lenoir on France's Radio Inter, an in-between EP was released, Cherry Tree, containing what would become the blueprint for the sound on their next record and the session of Sad Song's standout Murder Me Rachael. After these accolades and being impressed by their live show, Roger Trust signed them to Beggars Banquet.

A show at their favorite bar became a van ride to neighboring cities, became a plane ride to Europe, became two summers overseas. Their ties to those good jobs slackened. And they continue on their own path, moving out even further out in Brooklyn to Ditmas Park, where there is space and familiar suburban streets and even Geese on Beverly Road. Their album, ""Alligator"", much of which was recorded at their homes in Ditmas Park, was engineered by Paul Mahajan, who has worked with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and TV on the Radio. Padma Newsome camped out for a month with the band, and Peter Katis added more production and mixed the record at his house in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

Berninger's potent baritone still intones about matters fraught and funny and sad; about record collections, missing persons and medium-sized American hearts. But the record's not simply gothic or miserablist -- more like the plays of Tennessee Williams, it's full of peculiar intimacies and awkward grace. Alligator's heroes are reckless and possessed seducers, but they are apologetic ones. In The National's imaginings, in songs alternately lush and spare, there is something twighlit and dreamy worked out in the basement of our brains.

""Abel,"" ""Secret Meeting,"" and ""Lit Up"" were released as singles.

On May 22, 2007, The National released their follow-up to Alligator, Boxer, on Beggars Banquet. Taking advantage of the fact that nobody had heard their first album and earliest demos, Matt proceeded to steal lyrics and melodies from them and give them the attention they deserved while keeping the intimacy that made them special. They even managed to convince new friend Sufjan Stevens to lay down some piano tracks for them, and recorded the album in a scant 6 months after coming off the long post-Alligator road.

""Mistaken for Strangers"", ""Fake Empire"" and ""Apartment Story"" have been released as singles. The band have just finished touring North America and are on a large European autumn/winter tour after playing high slots at several large festivals. In their Dec. 07/Jan. 08 issue, Paste magazine named Boxer best record of 2007.

The band's fifth album, High Violet, was released on May 10, 2010 by 4AD Records. ""Bloodbuzz Ohio"", ""Anyone's Ghost"" and ""Terrible Love"" were released as singles.

In 2013 their sixth studio record Trouble Will Find Me was released and named ""Best New Music"" by Pitchfork. The album contained the single ""I Need My Girl"". In 2015, the album outtake ""Sunshine On My Back""  was released.

Four years after Trouble Will Find Me, marking the longest timespan between albums in their career so far, they released their seventh album Sleep Well Beast on September 8th, 2017 and were yet again met with great critical success.

78,78,ellie goulding,3344661,125508607,"Ellie Goulding (born Elena Jane Goulding, 30 December 1986 in Hereford, England) is an English singer-songwriter. Having caught the public's attention in 2010 with her singles ""Starry Eyed"" and ""Guns and Horses,"" British vocalist Ellie Goulding quickly rose to the top of the charts with her infectious electronic pop sound. Although she started out writing songs in a folk-inflected style, she eventually grew into a more electronic-influenced artist, touching upon dance music and ambient synth pop. With her unique soprano warble and knack for writing catchy yet emotionally earnest songs, Goulding, much like her predecessors Kate Bush and Imogen Heap, stands at the forefront of contemporary mainstream music and arty, independent-minded pop.

Born in Hereford, England, she later moved to the country's east coast to study drama at the University of Kent. Goulding had developed a love for folk music as a teenager, and her time at university also exposed her to electronica. After two years, she took a break from her studies and moved to West London, where she pursued a career as an alternative singer/songwriter and befriended producers like Starsmith and Frankmusik, who gave her songs an electro-pop twist. In 2009, Goulding began building an audience via the Internet, where early tracks like ""Starry Eyed"" and a cover of Sam Sparro's ""Black & Gold"" were posted on tastemaking MP3 blogs such as Discodust. Goulding soon graduated from the blogosphere to print media, gaining praise from mainstream publications like The Guardian and fielding offers from record labels. She ultimately signed a major-label deal with Polydor Records and began making preparations to release her debut album. In the meantime, she penned songs for Diana Vickers, Gabriella Climi, and others.

During the final weeks of 2009, Goulding topped the BBC's Sound of 2010, a poll conducted by British music critics and industry insiders to identify new talent. Building on that momentum, she released Lights -- a sparkling debut album that splashed Goulding's vocal flutter across a landscape of acoustic and synthesized instruments -- in March 2010. Lights topped the U.K. charts during its first week and spun off ""Starry Eyed"" as a Top Five single (it also charted well in Ireland and New Zealand). Later that year, the album was re-released as Bright Lights, featuring seven new recordings (including a cover of Elton John's ""Your Song,"" which peaked at number two).

In 2012, Goulding returned with her sophomore album, Halcyon, which showcased an even more sonically adventurous, electro-pop-infused sound. In 2013, a deluxe reissue featuring ten extra songs was released; entitled Halcyon Days, it acted as a supplement to the original release. Two of its new songs, ""Burn"" and ""How Long Will I Love You,"" were among her biggest hits. The following year, she was featured on Calvin Harris' Top Ten U.K. hit ""Outside,"" participated in Band Aid 30's update of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?,"" and entered the U.K. Top Ten once more with ""Beating Heart,"" a song released on the soundtrack for Divergent. Another soundtrack single, ""Love Me Like You Do,"" added to the success of Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015.

That same year, Goulding released her third studio album, Delirium, which featured collaborations with Max Martin, Greg Kurstin, and others. The pop-leaning Delirium included the single ""On My Mind"" and peaked at number three on the U.S. and U.K. charts. Goulding returned in 2017 on ""First Time,"" a collaboration with electronic producer Kygo.

In 2018, Goulding joined Tap Management after almost a decade with First Access Management.[107] She appeared on a collaboration with Sean Paul on his Mad Love the Prequel EP titled ""Bad Love"", released on 29 June 2018.[108]

Goulding collaborated with Diplo and Swae Lee on the single ""Close to Me"", which was released on 24 October 2018.[109] On 1 January 2019, The Guardian reported that she has been working on her fourth album, set to release in the same year.[110] On 1 March, she released the next single ""Flux"".[111] She said regarding the album, ""It's very much written by me"".[112]

On 12 April 2019, Goulding released the single ""Sixteen"".[113] Goulding said of the single, ""...That age was such a pivotal year for me in many ways and this song is so close to my heart. It takes me back to the reckless days of being a teenager and I hope it reminds us all about the innocence of youth.""[114]

Goulding released ""Hate Me"" with American rapper Juice Wrld on 26 June 2019.[115][116] It was premiered by Zane Lowe as his 'World Record' on Beats 1.[117] In July, Goulding stated that her next material to be released would be the songs ""Woman I Am"" and ""Start"".[118] In November, she released her rendition of Joni Mitchell's Christmas song ""River"", which topped the UK Singles Chart, becoming her third UK number one single and the last UK number one song of the 2010s.[119]

On 13 March 2020, Goulding released the new single ""Worry About Me"" which was created in-collaboration with Blackbear.[120] In a radio interview with Heart the same month, she revealed that the album ""kind of comes in two parts"", adding that ""the first side is something written entirely by me which was fun and I wrote most of it in New York when I was living there a few years back. I play the guitar and I play the bass and piano and then I'm singing a lot of vocals. It's very classically influenced because I love classical music. There's a lot going on, it's a big soundscape and one big film. The second half is my kind of alter ego songs.""[121] On 21 May she released single ""Power"" and on 30 June single ""Slow Grenade"" with Lauv.

Goulding released her fourth studio album, Brightest Blue, on 17 July 2020. Originally scheduled for 5 June 2020, the album's release was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album debuted at the top of the UK Album Chart, becoming Goulding's third album to do so,[122] as well as at No. 2 in Scotland.[123] It reached the top 10 in Ireland[124] as well as the top 40 in over ten countries including Australia, Germany and the United States.

Goulding announced on an Instagram Q&A that she would be releasing new music which was not part of the Brightest Blue era at the end of January 2021.[125] On 21 January, she released a collaboration with electronic duo Silk City, titled ""New Love"".[126] On 30 September, Goulding performed ""Anything Could Happen"" as part of the opening ceremony for Expo 2020, held in Dubai.[127]

On 19 June 2022, Goulding performed at Rock in Rio in Lisbon, Portugal. After the concert, she announced that she would be releasing new music in July. The following day, she blacked out all her social media profiles.[128] Back in July 2021, during an interview with Joe Wicks, she described the forthcoming album as ""a dance record. It's electronic pop, a dance thing from outer space"".[129] On 4 July 2022, she announced the release of ""Easy Lover"" featuring Big Sean, which was released on 15 July.[130] The single did not enter the UK Singles Top 100, but peaked at number 31 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart Top 100.[131] It was followed by ""All by Myself"", a collaboration between Goulding and producers Alok and Sigala, on 7 October.[132] Goulding released the single ""Let It Die"" along with its video on 19 October and announced the same day that her fifth studio album Higher Than Heaven would be released on 3 February 2023.[133][134]

79,79,bon entendeur,145269,1852550,"From shared passions was born an extraordinary project: Bon Entendeur. A duo in love with French culture and curious to invent hybrid formats fed by their passions. The result: Aller-retour. A cluster of beautiful ideas gathered in a unique album. 

Their adventure starts with a rather classical approach: arranging playlists fed with music they like. They gradually added what would become their trademark: the grain of a personality's voice on mixed music. Their format is declined during 5 years, 40 mixtapes, more than 70 million listening. A quality signature. Bon Entendeur has this desire to talk about culture in its original version. This sense of aestheticism, of appropriateness. And of the stage. Behind the turntables, they mix their tributes and move the packed halls on a very fine sound. They also have the audacity to never run out of ideas, and in 2015 they offered their first revisit of a song from the 70s, Le temps est bon. A success.

Their album Aller-Retour concentrates their DNA: it is composed of revisited songs from the 60s and 70s and original productions mixed with interviews. All elegantly arranged in 14 tracks. Bon Entendeur creates sounds that are new, that go back and forth with their inventive digital generation and the immense heritage of their predecessors. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bon+Entendeur"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

80,80,andrew bird,1528822,58956579,"Andrew Bird (born July 11, 1973) is an American musician. He was born in Lake Bluff, Illinois but currently resides in the Los Angeles area. Bird is a singer, a violinist and, since 2004, a guitarist. He is also an accomplished whistler.

His early work, which echoed gypsy jazz and traditional folk, has led into his current sound, which mixes rock with more broad compositions. His years of solo song-craft have now enabled him to produce a sound that is uniquely his own.

Trained by the Suzuki method from a young age and a graduate of Illinois' Northwestern University, Bird released his first solo album, Music of Hair, in  1996. Vastly different from his later releases, this first album showcases his violin skills and pays tribute to his fascination with both American and European folk traditions, as well as jazz and blues.

His initial commercial exposure was in collaborative work with the band Squirrel Nut Zippers. He was quickly lumped in with the swing craze that swept the United States music industry in the mid '90s; this is an affiliation that he is still working to shed.

Taking on the role of band leader in 1997 with Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire, he released the album Thrills. This was followed by Oh! The Grandeur in 1998. Both albums were heavily influenced by traditional folk, pre-war jazz and swing, with Bird relying on the violin as his primary musical instrument.

In 2001, Bird released The Swimming Hour, his third release with the Bowl of Fire and a dramatic departure from previous recordings. The Swimming Hour featured a mixture of styles, from the zydeco-influenced ""Core and Rind"" to more straightforward rock songs. He has often referred to this record as his ""jukebox album"".

The Bowl of Fire unofficially disbanded some time in 2003, having featured many skilled Chicago musicians including Kevin O'Donnell, Nora O'Connor, Andy Hopkins (aka Mr. Rudy Day), Jimmy Sutton, Colin Bunn and Ryan Hembrey.

Bird then released two subsequent solo albums, both distributed through the label operated by Ani DiFranco, Righteous Babe Records. The two records, 2003's Weather Systems and 2005's The Mysterious Production of Eggs, continue a progression towards an eclectic indie folk sound that has proven challenging to classify.

Bird's live solo shows have been notable in that he uses a multi-track system to sample and loop his own performance. For example, he may record a snippet of his performance on violin, then play a ""loop"" of that sound. This provides a more full-bodied sound and aurally suggests a band performance, rather than the sound of a solo artist.

Bird's next full-length album Armchair Apocrypha (Fat Possum) was released on March 20th 2007.

November 2007 saw the Soldier On EP originally a European tour-only release. But due to high demand and unanticipated critical acclaim was released digitally and in CD-format on both sides of the Atlantic. Critics and fans alike have hearkened to the EP's first track, ""The Trees Were Mistaken"", a complex yet austere looping composition that marks a departure from Bird's earlier body of work. It also contains a cover of Bob Dylan's ""Oh Sister"".

January 2009 saw Noble Beast, also available with instrumental album Useless Creatures, released worldwide to positive reviews.

The Fatal Shore Songfacts reports that Break it Yourself, Bird's sixth solo studio album, was released on March 6, 2012 through Mom+Pop records in the US and Bella Union in the UK. The origins of the LP lie in a couple of jam sessions by a gathering of Bird's friends in the singer's western Illinois barn, near the banks of the Mississippi River.

Of his 2019 album My Finest Work Yet, Talia Schlanger of NPR says ""Bird zooms way out on humanity across history's timeline, seeking insight about our current age, in a way he hopes 'stays above the news feed noise.'""  Many tracks, including the opener ""Sisyphus,"" include Andrew's trademark whistling. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Bird"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

81,81,alec benjamin,1119467,40852200,"After getting dropped by Columbia Records at 18 years old, singer-songwriter Alec Benjamin built a following by playing in parking lots outside of Shawn Mendes and Troye Sivan concerts.

She is known for singing and playing the ukulele. Her 2018 self-released EP, plum blossom, recorded on her laptop in her parents' guest bedroom, has been streamed over 100 million times. In 2019, she played sold out tours and her debut album the masquerade was released in September.

Recording with GarageBand in her parents' guest bedroom, creating percussion tracks with hair straighteners, Maia began self-releasing songs on YouTube as ""mxmtoon"" in 2017. After initially attempting to write comedy songs, she began writing songs that embodied her emotions such as ""feelings are fatal"", which only required a USB microphone and GarageBand. The song currently has over 23 million streams on Spotify. Her 2017 collaboration with Japanese lo-fi producer peachy!, ""Falling for U"", reached nearly 40 million streams on Spotify by June 2019. Maia began secretly releasing music to the public, but was later compelled to tell her friends and family after experiencing viral success online. In 2018, Maia released her debut EP, plum blossom, which was reviewed by Earmilk, i-D and Hypebeast, and gained more than 100 million streams on Spotify by August 2019. The EP's single ""i feel like chet"" is a tribute to one of her favorite jazz musicians, Chet Baker.

After high school, Maia took a ""gap year"" by postponing college to focus on her music. She was planning to study architecture after graduating high school, until her music went viral in April 2018. In November 2018, she announced her ""plum blossom tour"". Her first tour, initially scheduled for five US shows with fellow Californian singer-songwriter khai dreams in March 2019, sold out, and was extended to include additional concerts in North America and Europe, including opening appearances for bedroom pop YouTuber Cavetown in the United Kingdom. Maia made her first appearance on a billboard in Times Square when Spotify advertised her single ""dream of you"" for their New Music Friday playlist.

Prior to the release of the masquerade, Spotify announced the release of 21 Days, a music podcast that follows Maia while she works on the album in New York City. Liz Gateley of Spotify praised Maia's online following as well as her social presence, stating that ""She obviously has lots of followers already, but that's not enough. The person had to be the right human too, and we felt she had both."" The podcast is an eight-episode audio diary that includes interviews with family, friends and collaborators, including the album's producer Cavetown.

Maia's debut studio album the masquerade was released on September 17, 2019. The album peaked at 17 on the US Heatseekers Chart and at 45 on the US Indie Albums Chart. It features ""prom dress"", a ""light and peachy tune"" described as ""relatable, infectious hook-led pop that speaks to millennials"". The single is inspired by experiences from her own big night and deals with social anxiety and the problems that come with being a teen in modern society. The song has been streamed over 30 million times on Spotify, and has been used in 100,000 videos on TikTok. Maia's back catalogue of songs have also received tens of millions of online streams.

Joshua Bote of Paste described the ten-track album as ""comforting twee-pop that wrings out genuine pathos from mxmtoon’s internet celebrity"". Matt Yuyitung of Exclaim! wrote ""[Maia] brings her wry sense of humour and diary-entry lyricism to her debut record, recalling the lo-fi relatability of Frankie Cosmos.""

Maia embarked on her sold out ""the masquerade Tour"" of North America and United Kingdom in September 2019. She released her first graphic novel ""The Adventures Of Mxmtoon: The Masquerade"" in October 2019. Kirsten Spruch from Billboard wrote, ""The novel seamlessly pairs with the album, encapsulating her introverted, teenage tendencies and free-flowing creativity."" Gabe Bergado from Teen Vogue described the book ""a captivating, charming visual journey that complements the dreamy album."" She released an accompanying animated short film for the graphic novel in November 2019.

In November 2019, Maia announced via Twitter that she would be joining American singer-songwriter Lauv for his 2020 summer tour of Asia supporting his album how i'm feeling.

On November 19, 2019, Kobalt Music Group announced that they would be signing mxmtoon to their label under a global publishing deal. This deal will include administration and creative support for current music catalogue and future works. Creative Vice-President at Kobalt, Melissa Emert-Hutner, stated ""Maia is truly the voice of her generation; by sharing her beautiful, heartfelt music with the world and growing her brand organically, she exemplifies the DIY spirit and aesthetic that Kobalt embraces."" Emily Bines, a senior creative director at Kobalt added ""Mxmtoon is exactly the type of forward-thinking creative that we dream about working with at Kobalt. Her vision, matched with her team’s passion to bring it to fruition is unwavering. We will be hearing from Maia for a long time to come.""

Maia released the masquerade (the edits) on November 22, 2019. The EP features remixes from songs on the masquerade from names like Chloe Lilac, Alexander 23 and Chloe Moriondo.

In December 2019, Maia re-recorded the song ""prom dress"" in Simlish, the fictional language used in The Sims games, to help promotion.

89,89,maribou state,535966,11408405,"Maribou State is Chris Davids and Liam Ivory from Hertfordshire. Liam asked Chris to play bass for his band. When they moved up north to go to university, the band fell by the wayside and the pair began making electronic music in their home studio, forging a partnership that would soon become Maribou State.

In the summer of 2011 they were scouted by Fat! Records and put out their debut release, the 'Olivia' EP, which set a blueprint for Maribou State's trademark bass-heavy, melodic sound. Grassroots support for the duo was also building. When they brought out a bootleg of Lauryn Hill's 'Doo Wop' (produced in collaboration with Pedestrian), the tune racked up thousands of plays on YouTube and got airtime on Radio 1, 1Xtra and XFM courtesy of Diplo, B. Traits and Eddy Temple Morris respectively.

Their first project for Southern Fried was a remix of 'Hummus' by Crookers, which hit the top of the Hype Machine chart during the spring of 2012. Then the 'Native' EP dropped in June and one of the tracks from it, 'The Look', was promptly given 10/10 and awarded Tune Of The Month by Mixmag. Along with underground fans, key tastemakers were beginning to take note.

Momentum continued when, after a summer spent playing shows, the next single for Southern Fried was released. 'Scarlett Groove' (featuring Saint Saviour) was a certified off-kilter pop hit, notching up radio play from Annie Mac and Lauren Laverne as well as being given Essential Tune status by Pete Tong. It was an excellent way to round off 2012, a year made all the nicer when Maribou State's remix of Ultraista's 'Gold Dayzz' went viral, plonking the pair at the top of the Hype Machine chart once again and hitting over 200,000 plays on SoundCloud.

Their first major release of this year was another collaboration with Pedestrian. Signed by Polish house duo Catz 'N Dogz and put out via their Pets imprint, 'Mask' pushed Maribou State firmly to the fore of the British scene, running alongside Disclosure, Bondax and AlunaGeorge as artists dedicated to making accessible yet highly inventive dance music. The record also gained further radio play from Zane Lowe, Hugh Stephens and Rob Da Bank, as well as long-time supporters Annie Mac, B. Traits and Pete Tong.

As 2013 began to unfurl, Chris and Liam will release their latest single for Southern Fried, a record that marks the next stage of their career. A double-A side including 'Tongue' and 'Larks Rise', it sees them realise their vision of creating organic dance music in the same kind of way as Bonobo and Four Tet, forging field recordings and live instrumentation with broken house rhythms and waves of sub-bass.

95,95,lykke li,2696228,81949061,"Li Lykke Timotej Zachrisson (born on March 18, 1986) is a Swedish singer, songwriter and model from Stockholm. She is known for her blend of indie pop, dream pop, and electronic music. She grew up in a creatively and musically supportive environment; her mother, Kärsti Stiege, was a photographer and former member of the band Tant Strul, while her father, Johan Zachrisson, was a musician in the Swedish reggae/progg band Dag Vag. Her brother, Zacharias Zachrisson, also pursued a music career. The family moved frequently, living in Stockholm, Portugal, Nepal, and India, which exposed her to a variety of cultural and musical influences from a young age. These experiences would later inform her music style and creative outlook.

At 19, Lykke Li spent several months in Brooklyn, New York, immersing herself in the local music scene before returning to Sweden. She went back to Brooklyn two years later at age 21 to record her debut album, Youth Novels, which was released in Sweden on January 30, 2008. Produced by Björn Yttling of the band Peter Bjorn and John along with Lasse Mårtén, Youth Novels gained international acclaim for its confessional lyrics and minimalistic production. It was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland in June 2008 and in the United States on August 19. Her single ""Little Bit"" from the album captured widespread attention, gaining praise from the indie community and the music site Stereogum, which described her style as a blend of soul, electro, and “powdered-sugar pop.”

Building on the success of her debut, Lykke Li continued to release music that explored themes of love, heartache, and introspection. Her follow-up albums, Wounded Rhymes in 2011 and I Never Learn in 2014, showcased a more mature, emotionally charged sound, with Wounded Rhymes earning her two Swedish Grammy Awards for Artist of the Year and Album of the Year in 2012. Alongside her solo career, she collaborated with prominent artists like Kleerup and Röyksopp, lending her vocals to the tracks ""Until We Bleed,"" ""Miss It So Much,"" and ""Were You Ever Wanted."" Her growing popularity led to notable appearances on shows like Conan and Skavlan in early 2011, helping her reach an even broader audience.

In 2016, Lykke Li co-founded the band LIV alongside members of Miike Snow and Peter Bjorn and John, further expanding her creative pursuits. Two years later, she released her fourth album, So Sad So Sexy (2018), marking a shift towards a more mainstream pop sound infused with late-2010s production influences. Her 2022 album, Eyeye, saw her return to a more introspective and sonically experimental approach, once again showcasing her characteristic blend of melancholic lyrics and innovative production. Over her career, Lykke Li has built a reputation for her sensuous, ethereal vocals and innovative musical style, solidifying her place as a significant figure in contemporary indie pop and electronic music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lykke+Li"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Esteman has been developing his interest in music since the age of 12, as he attended several music and theatre academies, acting classes and college education in Electronic Media Arts. At a prodigiously young age Esteman started writing songs and school plays involving musical theatre for his elementary school and ever since, writing and performing has become one of his favorites activities. Later on, while he was in college, Esteman decided to pursue his music career full-time, he found in music a perfect space where he was able to focus in his main interest: music.
This is how Esteman's musical project begins, mixing styles and influences in order to build catchy melodies loaded with irony, where the plastic sounds of a synthesizer get together with percussion elements both usual and inusual, saxophones and old school guitars as we can hear in his first single ""No te metas a mi Facebook"" which translates ""Dont bother me on Facebook"".

With a careful fusion of elements where you can find eclectic pop, disco music, indie-pop, the most thought provoking lyrics and choreography, Esteman's project gets launched in the latin pop market with a musical, visual and performative proposal that will make you vibrate until the end of this song.

All but one track on the EP was produced by Loyle’s right hand man and live partner Rebel Kleff. The two of them create reminiscent old school hip hop with their own UK and modern influences. 

After first appearing in 2013 on Rejjie Snow’s ‘Rejovich’ EP on track ‘1992’, Loyle’s name started to make the rounds, not least to mention the track being picked up by Majestic Casual and has racked up over 700k views to date. Following the release of the ‘A Little Late’ EP, Loyle has gone on to work with the likes of Kae Tempest, Maverick Sabre, Tom Misch and multiple others, all in preparation for releases in 2015. 

With two successful UK tours now under his belt with Joey Bada$$ and Atmosphere, Loyle is set to make some serious moves on the UK circuit and abroad, with strong support coming from all over Europe, the US and Australia. Support in the UK has come from all areas, being championed on Radio 1Xtra by DJ Semtex and Phil Taggart, Huw Stephens and Lauren Laverne at Radio 1. His latest single with Kate Tempest was added to 6Music’s B-list and then bumped up to the A-List immediately after a week and has not stopped being played.

Carner released his third studio album, 'hugo', in October, 2022.

In 'hugo', there’s a central question that Loyle Carner keeps coming back to: “I’m young, Black, successful and have a platform - but where do I go next?” The answer is explored in this epic scream of a third album. With urgent delivery and gloriously widescreen production, Carner confronts both the deeply personal (“You can’t hate the roots of a tree, and not hate the tree. So how can I hate my father without hating me?) and the highly political (“I told the black man he didn’t understand I reached the white man he wouldn’t take my hand”). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Loyle+Carner"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

112,112,d'angelo,1066358,23138721,"D'Angelo is the name of more than one artist
1) US soul singer, songwriter & producer
2) Brazilian jazz/samba group

1) D'Angelo (born Michael Eugene Archer on 11 February 1974 in Richmond, VA, United States) is a neo-soul singer, keyboardist, and guitarist. He has released three albums, ""Brown Sugar"" (1995), ""Voodoo"" (2000), and ""Black Messiah"" as D'Angelo and the Vanguard (2014).

D'Angelo signed a publishing deal with EMI Music in 1991 after catching the attention of record executives with a demo tape. He penned the hit song ""U Will Know"" on the Jason's Lyric soundtrack. It was performed by Black Men United for the Jason's Lyric motion picture soundtrack. Shortly after, he was signed by Gary Harris and he began recording his debut album for EMI records.

Brown Sugar was released in June 1995. Though sales were sluggish at first, the album was eventually a hit, due in large part to ""Lady,"" a Top Ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, peaking at #10. The album earned platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America, following sales in excess of one million copies in the U.S., while its total sales have been estimated within the range of 1.5 million to over two million copies. The album helped give commercial visibility to the burgeoning neo soul movement of the 1990s, along with debut albums by Maxwell, Erykah Badu, and Lauryn Hill. The album was a critical success as well, and appeared on many critics' ""best of"" lists for the year.

Following his debut album's success, D'Angelo went into a four and a half year absence from the music scene and releasing solo work. His recordings for soundtracks included Belly (""Devil's Pie""), frequently singing covers like ""Girl You Need a Change of Mind"" (Eddie Kendricks, Get on the Bus), ""She's Always in My Hair"" (Prince, Scream 2) and ""Heaven Must Be Like This"" (The Ohio Players, Down in the Delta), as well as appearing on Lauryn Hill's landmark The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill on the duet ""Nothing Even Matters"".

The much-delayed follow-up to Brown Sugar, Voodoo, was finally released in 2000. It debuted at #1 and went on to win two Grammy Awards, one for Best R&B Album, and the other for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance. The lead single, 1999's ""Left & Right"" (featuring Method Man and Redman) did well, but it was the second single, ""Untitled (How Does It Feel)"" (a tribute to artist Prince), that became a huge R&B hit buoyed by an innovative yet infamous video featuring a nude D'Angelo from his face to his hips while singing the song. The video was nominated for 4 MTV Video Music Awards and currently ranks #44 in VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Videos. He also performed ""Be Here"" (with Raphael Saadiq) from Saadiq's album Instant Vintage.

After the release D'Angelo embarked on what would become one of the most fabled series of live soul shows in history, ""The Voodoo Tour."" Consisting of a live group entitled ""the Soultronics,"" (presumed to have been assembled by Ahmir ""Questlove"" Thompson of The Roots) which engulfed arena-size stages with various dancers and instrument players, it was one of the most attended shows of the year. The tour was taken all around the world, one of the most notable performances being the Free Jazz Festival in Brazil. The live show was a thinly-disguised homage to Prince's late 80's shows, in its grandeur and conceptual stage set-up & setlist. Slum Village (then in its original line-up of Jay Dee, Baatin & T3) opened for D'Angelo on several dates, and soul-tinged R&B singer Anthony Hamilton sang backup in the band.

In 2002, Q magazine named him in their list of the ""50 Bands To See Before You Die"", and in 2003 Voodoo was ranked at number 488 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Pitchfork Media rated it at #44 on their list of the best albums of the 2000s.

Bon Iver is a Grammy Award winning  folk band from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, United States, and one of Justin Vernon's current and most notable music projects to date. The band also consists of Mike Noyce, Sean Carey and Matt MacCaughan. 

The name 'Bon Iver' (pronounced ""bon ee-VAIR"") is a play on the French phrase 'bon hiver' meaning 'good winter'. Vernon independently released Bon Iver's debut album For Emma, Forever Ago in 2007, most of which was recorded during a four-month stay in a remote cabin in Wisconsin.

While in high school and college Vernon founded the indie-rock bands Mount Vernon and DeYarmond Edison in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, where he still resides.

According to the For Emma Songfacts, after the break-up of De Yarmond Edison, Vernon retreated to his father's log cabin, out in the woods of north-east Wisconsin to hibernate for three snowy months. There he collected his thoughts and formulated them into a suite of songs,  For Emma, Forever Ago . The album was originally self-released in late 2007 in a run of 500 copies and sold out instantly. 

The album garnered critical acclaim, and was picked up by the indie-rock label Jagjaguwar, which gave the album a proper release on February 19th, 2008. The album was released in the UK and Europe by iconic indie 4AD on May 12, 2008.

When released in the UK, For Emma, Forever Ago received 5/5 and ""Album of the Month"" reviews in both MOJO and Uncut magazines. It is currently the third highest rated album of 2008 on review-aggregator site Metacritic, with accolades from publications including The Village Voice, The Hartford Courant and The A.V. Club.

The group's second album Bon Iver, Bon Iver was released on June 17, 2011 to universal acclaim. It was named by Pitchfork Media as the best album of 2011 on their annual list. At the 2012 Grammys, the album won Best Alternative Album and the group was awarded Best New Artist, despite having debuted in 2007.

Thus far, they have earned dozens of Gold, Platinum & Multi Platinum certifications, tallied over 5 billion streams, & notched 11 #1 records on Alternative Radio. The guys consecutively garnered 2 GRAMMY® Awards for ""Best Rock Album"" for both Tell Me I'm Pretty
[2015] and Social Cues [2019]. Of the latter, Entertainment Weekly raved, ""The album's introspection paired with its urgent energy make Cage The Elephant sound more passionate than ever."" In the meantime, their music has also surged through pop culture as ""Cigarette Daydreams"" graced the soundtrack of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 video game, ""Goodbye"" appeared in The Summer | Turned Pretty, & ""Trouble"" powered a global campaign for Amazon Prime.
The Kentucky-bred six-piece instinctually lean on their enduring bond as both musicians & friends to get through anything & everything.
Moments of elation might take the form of sticky hooks, swaggering rhythms, or upbeat guitars, while tense riffs & jittery grooves could give shape to feelings of anxiety, doubt, or instability. As such, the group fearlessly alchemize a season of tragedy & turbulence into the 12 tracks on their 6th full-length album, Neon Pill. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cage+the+Elephant"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

126,126,matt corby,415862,6002592,"Matthew John ""Matt"" Corby (born 7 November 1990, Australia) is an Australian singer songwriter.

Matt Corby has certainly carved a unique path for someone that started his career aged 16 on a reality TV talent show in 2007. In 2009, he independently released his debut EP 'Song For...' before relocating to London and signing with renowned UK indie label Communion after capturing the attention of the label's owner; Ben Lovett of Mumford and Sons fame.

Matt Corby’s songs and vocals elicit a sensation that is nothing short of captivating. Having previously been compared to legendary artists such as Nick Drake and Jeff Buckley, Matt’s songs continue to deliver a uniqueness and maturity well beyond his years while his live performances have become renowned for bringing large audiences to a complete stand still.

After recording with Ian Grimble (The Libertines, Seasick Steve) and releasing his hauntingly beautiful EP 'Transition To Colour' in late 2010, Matt has been busy engaging audiences with his live shows. Matt spent the earlier part of 2011 playing sold out shows in London and showcasing at SXSW in Austin, Texas in February before coming back to Australia to play a string of intimate “Secret Garden” shows in fans’ backyards. He soon after joined UK band Elbow as the main support on their national tour of sold out Splendour sideshows in July.

On 1 October 2015, Matt released his first song in two years, 'Monday' from his debut album, 'Telluric'. The song was described as containing ""lush, transcendent harmonies, wailing falsetto, folky boom-claps and heartbreaking lyrics"", and later voted 53 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2015. 'Telluric' was eventually released on 11 March 2016.

On 7 September 2018, Matt announced his 2nd studio album 'Rainbow Valley', released 2 November 2018.

Personally, Matt enjoys surfing and reading, and became a father with his first child in early 2018.

The band consists of lead vocalist Joshua William ""Josh"" Taylor, drummer Brett Kramer, and bass guitarist J. Tyler Johnson. The band's journey began when Josh Taylor, formerly of the band The Moderates, embarked on a songwriting endeavor after parting ways with his previous group. This led to the creation of their first EP, ""3,"" which was released in April, 2017. The EP quickly gained traction online, amassing millions of streams and establishing a dedicated fanbase for the band.

However, their breakthrough came in 2018 with the release of their single ""still feel."" with an accompanying music video, received media attention and led to the band signing a record deal with RCA Records. ""still feel."" also charted on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart and has amassed over 80 million streams on YouTube and Spotify.

In August 2019, half•alive released their debut studio album titled ""Now, Not Yet."" The album was well-received, and the band embarked on a worldwide tour, performing in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. 

In 2022, the band released ""Give Me Your Shoulders, Pt. 1,"" which served as the first part of their second studio album. However, they later announced the cancellation of ""Give Me Your Shoulders, Pt. 2"" and unveiled a new single called ""Did I Make You Up?"" This single was followed by the release of their second album, ""Conditions of a Punk,"" in December 2022.

On October 13, 2022, they released the single ""Did I Make You Up?"" along with its captivating music video, which culminated in the announcement of their second album, ""Conditions of a Punk,"" set to be released on December 2, 2022.

half•alive's musical style is a blend of beat-driven dance-pop, dark electro-rock, and indie pop. They draw inspiration from various genres and incorporate elements of R&B, funk, soul, and electronic music. The band has cited influences such as Sufjan Stevens, Vulfpeck and Christine and the Queens. Their lyrics often touch on themes of anxiety and religion, and they strive to create a balance between abstract and relatable lyrics to allow listeners to interpret the songs in their own way. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/half%E2%80%A2alive"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

129,129,men i trust,1716355,86337351,"Men I Trust is Dragos, Emma, Jessy, Mathieu and Alexis. Founded in 2014, the indie dance band from Montreal, Canada loves smooth sounds, calm melodies and simple rhythms that relax, but make your right foot tap and your chin bounce on the beats. They record, mix, master and shoot their music videos. 

Jessy and Dragos knew each other since their fourth year of high school. Back then (mid-2000’s), Dragos had somewhat of a background in classical piano and Jessy mastered the dark and esoteric art of the metal guitar solist.

In 2012, while finishing his master’s degree in audio postproduction at Laval University, Dragos spent most of his days and sleeping hours at the “LARC” studio working on his solo projects. He randomly met Jessy again, who was finishing his bachelor degree in Jazz guitar, in one of the faculty’s hallways and talked about doing a French-Touch / Italo-Disco track together. Some weeks later, they did just that. And it worked out so well that they decided to extend their collaboration to a whole project where many singers such as Odile Marmet-Rochefort, Gabrielle Shonk, Helena Deland and Geoffroy Sauvé, would be involved.

Between 2012 and 2016, all of Jessy’s and Dragos’ releases were made as part of Dragos’ masters and (dropped) PhD studies in order to gain access to the LARC’s infrastructure and to develop a unique sound.


Emma was a fortuitous encounter. In 2015 a mutual friend presented her to Dragos through a video posted over the Internet. She was casually singing and playing the guitar around a campfire with some of her friends. Emma’s voice was different, being less clear, more grainy and fragile with a mysterious twist that caught their attention. They reached her and tried recording one song called “Out in myself”, which turned to be one of the band’s easiest to record.

Jessy and Dragos then invited her to join them on live shows with Odile at the beginning of 2015. The womans' voices blended wonderfully together and the band got lots of positive feedback from the experience. Emma has been part of Men I Trust since then.

With their second album “Headroom"", Men I Trust truly became a trio. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Men+I+Trust"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
130,130,cocoon,272139,4527296,"There are at least six bands called Cocoon:

1. Cocoon is a two-piece French band formed in 2006 by Mark Daumail (born 1984, composition, lead vocals, acoustic guitar, ukelele, banjo, beatbox, etc.) and Morgane Imbeaud (born 1987, vocal harmonies, keyboards, arrangements).

""I wanted it to be a male-female duet. A duo like the White Stripes are in rock — we wanted to be the equivalent in folk music,"" Daumail says. Their songs are entirely sung in English. ""French artists singing in English isn't something new. It goes back to groups like Les Thugs and Syd Matters,"" he remarks.

Daumail says he's always been interested in folk music: ""Basically, Cocoon's musical inspiration goes all the way from groups like The Pentangle and Fairport Convention right through to the 'new folk' movement that surfaced around the beginning of 2000 with artists like CocoRosie, Devendra Banhart and Sufjan Stevens.""

In 2006, the pop / folk duet released its first EP, entitled I Hate Birds, and won the 2006 edition of the Big Jama regional contest. The following year, Cocoon was signed onto the French indie label Sober & Gentle. The band released a second EP, From Panda Mountains, followed by their first album, entitled My Friends All Died in a Plane Crash. The group won the CQFD music contest organized by the French magazine Les Inrockuptibles and performed in the new talent section of the rock music festivals Le Printemps de Bourges and Les Eurockéennes de Belfort.

2. Cocoon is a solo project by one of the founding members of the French group Clair Obscur which was one of the first groups in the 80's in France to work across music, visual arts, dance and theatre. Clair Obscur was one of the very few bands of the French cold wave/industrial scene which became known abroad with its records released by the British labels Cathexis, All the Madmen and NER (compilation From Torture to Conscience with Current 93, In the Nursery, Death in June, etc). 

Christophe Demarthe has been working for many years at the frontier of sound and visual arts. He has created sound architectures for theatre, dance, cinema, visual arts, radio... mainly working with the drama producer Bruno Lajara (501 Blues, Ne Pas, Fuites, Après Coups, Léon le Nul...) and with Jean Couturier for radio dramas on France Culture. He has written music for the cinema and for television (France 2, Canal Plus). 

In 2004 he created Cocoon, releasing his debut album on the French label Optical Sound. Much more than a mere sound object based on an album concept, Cocoon can be read as a global artistic project close to the performance. It is an audio set accompanied by videos and asking for an active participation of the public, banishing the passive listening of laptoppers. The stage disposition creates a real contrast with the characteristic immobility of electronic music concerts, and definitively places itself at the crossing point of image, sound and live show, for a moving interdisciplinarity. 

Since its creation in 2004, Cocoon has participated in the festivals Nowa Fabryka (Bytom, Poland), Emergences/Villette Numérique (Paris), Nuit Blanche (Paris), Emo-Son (Bourges), Salon Light (Paris)... He has been reviewed in Libération, on Arte-TV.com, in the magazines Mouvement, Télérama, The Wire, on France Culture... His second album, More Violent Days Are to Come (OS.012) (Optical Sound), has been nominated for the Qwartz Electronic Music Awards 2006/2007.

133,133,alex ferreira,54207,675999,"Alex Ferreira was born in Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) on March 23, 1983. He spent his childhood and adolescence between New York, Miami and Santo Domingo. He began playing guitar and writing songs at 16 years of age.

The Britpop of the 90s, 60s folk, Argentinean rock, boleros and Cuban trova, is a mere sum of its influences. He began playing professionally in the Dominican famous cultural center ""Casa de Teatro"" as well as other bars in the Colonial Zone of Santo Domingo. Sometimes accompanied by his band and many times just with his guitar, there he released his first songs. He recorded his first demos and quickly made himself known in the music scene of his country. There also, he shared the stage with great Dominican singers as Víctor Víctor, Luis Dias, José Antonio Rodríguez, among others.

During the spring of 2005 he released his self-produced and self-published (limited only to 250 copies) first album entitled ""Parto Mi Viaje."" For this album, some of the country's leading musicians collaborated with him. Singles from this album such as ""Rienda Suelta"", ""Siete sin suerte"" and ""Uno más aquí"", were widely played in Santo Domingo's rock stations. He also released demos as ""Zigzag"" and ""Pixel"" which also reached the first positions in the lists of stations in the country. That same year, Alex won the prestigious music competition in ""Casa de Teatro"" in 2 different categories (pop and rock). And is nominated, at the Dominican Republic's Casandra Awards for Best Rock Group of the Year.

Later that year he decided to abandon his studies of ""Advertising Communication"" and travels to Spain to study a ""Degree in Recording Arts"" for three years. His primary purpose for this trip was to form a band and appear on stage. Since then, resides there. The idea to form a band, never took shape and Alex decided to stick with his solo project.

The ""underground scene"" of Madrid welcomes him as one of theirs. Playing in bars in the center and then in theaters of high caliber. After recording several demos in the city of Madrid in 2006, trying different lineups in his band, traveling in Spain small gigging, and writing songs, he decided to record in the summer of 2007, the acoustic EP ""Un Domingo Cualquiera"", produced by David Quinzán and Ferreira himself and recorded in Aristi Studios in Madrid. In this work he shows his maturity as a songwriter and in it, Spanish musicians played with him. This EP was placed on his website, after signing a publishing contract with EMI Music Publishing Spain. After a year of concerts in Spain, he eventually signed a recording contract in 2008 with Warner/DRO Music Spain. That same year he published ""Serenata de Plástico"", an EP containing 5 songs. He shared stage with known Spanish pop artists ranging from Iván Ferreiro to Kiko Veneno. ""Casa América"" and ""Latin Fusion"" magazines name him among the 100 most influential Latinos in 2008. In April 2009 Warner/DRO released ""Páginas"", another EP of 5 songs. His name began to appear on posters for national festivals, between the biggest names in modern Spanish pop. In January 2010, he published his first full-length album entitled ""Un Domingo Cualquiera"" appointed by Radio 3 as one of the most anticipated albums of the year.

Singing in the local church choirs as a boy, studying jazz and classical piano performance, composition, and arrangement, and singing and playing keyboards in the ska band Gangster Politics in high school.

135,135,charlie cunningham,268310,3418551,"Charlie Cunningham is an English singer-songwriter based in Oxford.

Cunningham is a fresh talent, proving to be more than just a man with a guitar and a voice; a regularity that we have become all too familiar with. His new and ambitious EP Outside Things combines beautiful, yet honest song-writing with such percussive guitar playing that he truly stands out from the crowd.

Title track “Outside Things’” premièred on Best Fit; the lyrics are from the perspective of a newly-born baby. It’s a time that occurs in everyone’s life that cannot be remembered or recalled, this therefore, explorative aspect to his song-writing shows the depth Cunningham has to offer, unlike so many artists of his type. The song manages to convey an impression of diving in and out from the confusion of that foreign experience in such a compelling nature, accompanied by intense vocals playing on the track’s intimacy. “Outside Things’” carries with it a strange sense of longing, which is continuous throughout the EP.

“In One Out” is the first track to be heard on the record; it’s melodic, but profoundly sombre and relatively dark sounding. The finger-picked guitar behind the vocals is hypnotic. There’s a slight step away from this intensity of the opening track and that of the title track in “Lights Off” and “Plans” - the second and fourth tracks on the EP. With far less movement there’s time to breathe between songs, it really helps to make each one stand out in their own right. During both of these tracks Cunningham creates moments of silence, with constant breaks where everything comes to a brief halt – if you heard these tracks live you’d want to be situated in an intimate and silent setting.

The Outside Things EP not only demonstrates Cunningham’s impeccable writing ability, but his intricate and skilful playing technique, developed and picked up from his time spent in Seville, along with showing off his individual voice. Through the EP Cunningham’s percussive, yet flexible guitars playing technique is something to be whole heartedly admired. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Cunningham"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Originally part of short-lived Chicago group I Rowboat, Johnson and two of his fellow Rowboat members, guitarist Dan Strack and drummer Brian Belval, created Fruit Bats as a side-project. When I Rowboat split up, Fruit Bats became Johnson's main focus.

After tours with Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, Modest Mouse and The Shins, Fruit Bats signed with Sub Pop in late summer 2002, recording their second album, 2003's Mouthfuls, which included new bandmate Gillian Lisee.

After relocating to Seattle, the group released their third album, Spelled in Bones, in 2005. Afterward, Eric D. Johnson played with The Shins and Vetiver. In 2008, the Fruit Bats began working together again, with revised membership of Johnson, Christopher Sherman, Ron Lewis, Graeme Gibson, and Sam Wagster. In 2009, they released The Ruminant Band and in 2011 came Tripper. 

In November 2013, Eric D. Johnson announced he would be dissolving Fruit Bats. That month they played what was to be their farewell show at a sold out Aladdin Theatre in Portland, OR. The following year Johnson released an album under the name EDJ. 

Reforming in 2015, Fruit Bats released their sixth official full-length LP, Absolute Loser, in 2016 via newly formed Los Angeles-based label Easy Sound.

Childers began performing in Lexington, Kentucky and Huntington, West Virginia. In 2011, when he was 19, Childers released his first album, Bottles And Bibles. He has also released two EPs recorded in 2013 at Red Barn Radio, a radio show from Lexington. The two EPs were later released as one after the success of his album Purgatory, and reached No. 5 on Heatseekers Albums.

He had his first success with Purgatory, a breakthrough album released on August 4, 2017. The album was produced by Sturgill Simpson and David Ferguson and recorded at The Butcher Shoppe in Nashville. Simpson also played guitar and sang backing vocals on the album, with Miles Miller on drums, Stuart Duncan on fiddle and Russ Paul on other instruments. It debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums chart, No. 17 on the Country albums chart and No. 4 on the Americana/Folk albums chart. In September 2018, Childers won Emerging Artist of the Year at the 2018 Americana Music Honors & Awards, where he gave an acceptance speech noted for its criticism of the Americana genre label, saying that ""as a man who identifies as a country music singer, I feel Americana ain't no part of nothing and is a distraction from the issues that we're facing on a bigger level as country music singers. It kind of feels like purgatory.""

Country Squire, a second album under the Hickman Holler label, and Childers' third overall, was released on August 2, 2019, after being announced in May 2019. This album was again produced by Simpson and Ferguson. The video of the lead single from the album ""House Fire"" was also released on May 16, 2019.

Childers' music is influenced by his home state of Kentucky and its connection to country music and bluegrass. He often writes about coal mining, which was his father's occupation, and its effects. Rebecca Bengal, writing for The Guardian, described Childers' songs as a ""counternarrative to the outsiders who seek to perpetuate stereotypes of backwardness and poverty."" Childers emphasizes lyrical content in songs, comparing the songwriting process to telling short stories. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tyler+Childers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The single Between the Buttons, a contemplative, synth heavy gem enhanced by a beautiful arpeggiator, excepted from his first EP Angel, instantly placed him on the list of today’s most important producers. 

This first successful attempt enriched the tracklist of the album Olympic, alongside another pop gem, “Diamond Veins”, a duet with North American diva Sarah Rebecca. The album was quickly met with a worldwide audience, paving the way for Simon Henner to acquire over 150 concerts around the Globe. 

This led him to becoming an ambassador for Marseille’s electronic scene – a territory he had already stepped into with the various projects of Husbands, Nasser and Kid Francescoli. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/French+79"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

143,143,metronomy,1410361,53062037,"Metronomy is an electropop group which formed in 1999 in Totnes, Devon, United Kingdom, originally as the solo project of Joseph Mount. The project later expanded into a full band, which currently consists of Joseph Mount (vocals, keyboards, guitar), Oscar Cash (keyboards, saxophone, vocals), Gbenga Adelekan (bass, vocals) and Anna Prior (drums, vocals). The band has released five albums: ""Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe)"" (2006), ""Nights Out"" (2008), ""The English Riviera"" (2011), ""Love Letters"" (2014) and ""Summer 08"" (2016).

Metronomy began in the tiny, bohemian market town of Totnes, Devon, when Joseph’s Dad sold his son a computer so he could sit in his bedroom and make electronic music. He was inspired by the likes of Autechre, LFO and Aphex Twin, more as a creative hobby than a pop masterplan.

After decamping to Brighton for Uni, Metronomy released their debut album in June 2006. It was called Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe), and its obtuse but fascinating, largely instrumental electro-pop reflected the eccentricity of its title, and the enduring influence of Totnes.

Joseph admits that he only, finally, saw the commercial possibilities of Metronomy when DJ, producer, Trash founder and electro-punk avatar Erol Alkan began to feature the single You Could Easily Have Me in his sets, and asked Metronomy to play at his club. Cue the need for a proper live show, and the additions of Gabriel Stebbing, Oscar Cash, dance routines and clothes that blink. 

Move on 2 years and Nights Out a wonky love-child of Giorgio Moroder, New Order, Pet Shop Boys and Unfinished Sympathy is a second album that feels like a debut. The first to be vocal-led, with the self-effacing Joseph stepping up and grabbing the mic for most of the tracks; and, crucially, the first to introduce Metronomy as a fully live propsition, rather than a pseudonym for Joseph‘s solo work. 

As Metronomy’s busy touring schedule built a buzz amongst kids who instinctively get the dance/art crossover, In April 2009 the Metronomy show took another leap in its evolution, with the addition for the first time of a live drummer in Anna Prior, and bassist Gbenga Adelekan. The new Metronomy was completely live, proving it is possible for electronic bands to put on show as authentic as any rock band. 

Meanwhile Joseph has embarked on a series of prestigious remixes for the likes of Klaxons, Franz Ferdinand, Gorillaz and collaborations with Kate Nash and Florence and The Machine. Metronomy produced part of the highly acclaimed Roots Manuva album Slime and Reason. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Metronomy"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Williams grew up in Santa Cruz, CA. At 17, she signed a recording contract with PLG/SonyBMG and moved to the friendly, muggy town of Nashville, TN. She co-wrote and recorded several albums and realized after 7 years of being on the road full time that it was song-writing that kept tugging at her heart. Williams is now signed as a full-time writer with Judy Stakee at Warner/Chappell in LA and is with ASCAP. She writes for various projects daily with a team of very talented people from around the globe. She has the chance to work with American Idol finalists, rock bands, pop acts, indie artists, tv/film projects, CCM, country and more.

In 2010 Oscar Mayer settled on  Doesn't Get Better Than This from Joy to be their new add campaign song. According to Mayers ""[Joy] wrote what ended up being the tag line for the whole campaign, “It doesn’t get better than this.”

In May of 2010, Williams recorded and released two brand new songs whose profits went towards Nashville's flood relief efforts. The first song was called ""We Are"" and was avalible for download via NoiseTrade's download widget. The second flood relief song was titled ""Let's Jump"" and was released on Ten Out of Tenn's Nashville benefit compilation, ""We Are All In This Together"".

In addition to her solo endeavors, Williams has recently begun a new band with fellow singer and songwriter, John Paul White, called The Civil Wars.

151,151,baynk,319465,4189580,"Pushing beyond his playlist origins, the New Zealand producer’s debut album revels in eccentric details while adhering to traditional pop structures. Like so many electronic artists in the mid-’10s, New Zealand’s BAYNK (Jock Nowell-Usticke) got his start making chill, pop-adjacent songs that seemed primed for placement in mood-based playlists. His early attempts at surf-bro EDM sounded like what Kygo and LeMarquis were putting out on SoundCloud at the time; he used his voice sparingly, mainly as material to be sampled. In the years since, though, he has refined his palette. On 2017’s Someone’s EP I and 2019’s Someone’s EP II, his percussion took on the rhythmic impulse of Four Tet, and his rubbery basslines and glossy experimentalism were reminiscent of early Cashmere Cat and Flume. Using his Auto-Tuned falsetto to further texturize his songs, BAYNK’s fusion of house, R&B, and pop soon set him apart from the many similar acts scattered throughout the scene.

Adolescence is BAYNK’s most meticulous work to date. It revels in eccentric, distinctive details while adhering to traditional pop structures. Most arrangements consist of grainy synth loops, plucky subs, and house-inspired drums; his digital sounds are drenched in reverb and slapped with sidechain. On the Cosmo’s Midnight-assisted “How Does it Feel?” languid synth pulses and a funky bassline give way to some of the sharpest vocal melodies on the album. “Remember,” which features Rainsford, exhibits BAYNK’s talent for peeling a heavily layered song back to its component parts before climaxing into an ecstatic yet graceful drop. This is dance music for headphones, club music for late-night walks.

The best songs on Adolescence bend toward straightforward pop formulas and, tellingly, include non-electronic instruments. “Mine” is led by quiet piano and spacey guitar, while standout “Naked” blends acoustic elements and electric bass with shimmering synths. BAYNK gives his best vocal performances here: “Get caught up on trying to pin you down/Your fingers ’round my neck, they’re feeling soft now,"" he coos on “Naked,” evoking the warm upper register of Whitney’s Julien Ehrlich. He’s not a great singer, as Tinashe makes plain when she steals the show on “Esther”; he scrubs clean his imperfections with layers of automation, delay, and reverb. Still, BAYNK has a keen ear for melody and knows his limits, wisely ceding the mic to guests while he works the boards.

The album is nominally a concept record about the immediacy of youth and romantic first experiences. “I went through this period of not being able to write anything,” BAYNK told Apple Music. Being in a “stable and happy relationship” wasn’t conducive to inspiration, so to get around his writer’s block, he returned to the creative cocoon of “first love.” Lyrically, the album is imagistic and vague, depicting half-baked scenes of lying in the sun, holding hands in a car, and walking through fields. The narrative never coalesces into anything meaningful, and its emotional pull wanes quickly. First love invigorates but rarely sustains; it’s BAYNK’s elastic and original production that propels the album forward, the pulse of the beat begging us to feel something beyond recognition. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/BAYNK"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Bibio's music combines electronic and acoustic/traditional instruments, his main instrument being guitar. Bibio's signature 'grainy' sound is partly due to the use of analogue tape and vintage recording equipment, which is more exaggerated in his earlier Mush releases. Wilkinson himself labeled his debut on Mush as ""Saturated Folk"".

Earlier in 2014, The Dead South entered the 104.9FM The Wolf Queen City Rocks battle of the bands competition where they won, coming  out ahead of 24 other bands. Soon afterwards, they were selected to represent Saskatchewan in the nationwide CBC Searchlight competition for Canada's best new artist. They subsequently received local and national recognition along with airplay on 104.9FM The Wolf , CBC Radio 2 and several other radio stations, some of which include CJTR Regina Community Radio, CFCR Saskatoon Community Radio, and CBC Radio 1 in Saskatchewan.
 
The Dead South has been interviewed and featured in many newspapers across the province, some of which include the Leader Post, The Verb, Metro, Bridges, and QC. They have been on Global TV and CTV several times promoting their music and shows. The band was also on the cover of City Slicker, a Regina magazine, which featured a band profile after having won Queen City Rocks.
 
Since the inception of the band, The Dead South has continually pushed the energy of their live shows, as well as pushed what is possible between four ordinary acoustic instruments. The unique abilities and viewpoints of each band member make The Dead South an impossible band to duplicate, and a fixture of the Regina music scene that will not soon be leaving.

Lleshaj, an Albanian originally from Kosovo, whose family fled to Sweden while she was a child to escape war and conflict in the region, was living in Stockholm when she met Randall, from Minneapolis, on SoundCloud in 2012. Lleshaj began commenting on the tracks Randall had posted and the two discovered they appreciated each other's music. After meeting in person in Minneapolis, they began working together in Sweden as Flora Cash. The duo has said that they've never revealed the origin or meaning of their band name to anyone.

In 2012, the pair met on SoundCloud and struck up a musical connection, leading Shpresa Lleshaj to travel from Stockholm to Minneapolis to meet Cole Randall in person. They returned to Sweden together and immediately began work as Flora Cash. 

They released their debut EP, Mighty Fine, on December 12, 2012. Their second EP, Made It for You, came out on June 13, 2013. That year, Lleshaj and Randall also married. A third EP, I Will Be There, followed on September 20, 2014.

After independently releasing a handful of songs and two EPs, the pair signed with Swedish label Icons Creating Evil Art, after which they released, Can Summer Love Last Forever?, in March 2016. The seven-song mini-LP earned them nominations for two GAFFA awards, as Swedish Artist of the Year and Swedish Newcomer of the Year.

Flora Cash broke into the mainstream with their song “You’re Somebody Else”; a track from their debut full-length album, Nothing Lasts Forever (And It’s Fine), which Steve Baltin, writing for Forbes Magazine called “arguably the most intriguing song on radio this past year.”. The song reached #1 on Alternative Radio and achieved RIAA Platinum Certification in the United States.

The duo performed several times on American television after making their debut on The Late Late Show with James Corden and toured with Sir Sly, Joywave, lovelytheband, Judah & the Lion and AJR throughout 2018 and 2019.

In early 2020, Flora Cash released ‘Baby, It’s Okay’ on Sony’s RCA Records, which featured Billboard charting singles ‘Missing Home’ and ‘They Own This Town.' <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Flora+Cash"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He intended on pursuing a career in film prior to becoming a musician. A skiing and skating accident drew Pillsbury into a depression, which stunted his desire to make music.

As a child, he was heavily inspired by Elvis Presley and would perform for his family while dressed as him. Throughout high school, he took an interest in film, and in 2016, he moved to Pittsburgh to major in film at Point Park University. During his freshman year, he broke his wrist due to a skiing accident at Sugarloaf Mountain and later broke his wrist again due to a skateboarding accident. While he was stuck in his dorm, two of his friends left music equipment in his dorm, prompting him to record several rap mixtapes while learning how to use Logic Pro. He soon dropped out of college after his grades started to fall.

ROLE MODEL began rapping in 2016 under the mononym Tucker, and released his debut mixtape, Since When. He soon changed his stage name to DILLIS, and self-released his debut album ""Moth"" in June 2016. That same month, he performed at a show at the Maine State Pier, and he later performed as an opener for Lil Debbie during her 2016 U.S. tour.

In early 2017, he changed his stage name to ROLE MODEL and switched from rapping to singing. He self-released his debut EP, ARIZONA IN THE SUMMER, in December 2017 after recording it in his closet, which earned him a following online. After hearing the EP, rapper Mac Miller invited ROLE MODEL to Los Angeles for the two to work together. He was signed to Interscope Records in 2018.

A music video for his song ""blind"" was released in October 2020. In July 2021, he released the single ""forever&more"", and in September 2021, he released the single ""death wish"".

On February 18, 2022, he released the single ""if jesus saves, she's my type"" alongside its music video. The same day, Role Model also announced the title, the tracklist, and the official release date of his debut album. In March 2022, he released the album's third single ""neverletyougo"" with a music video. His debut album, Rx, was released on April 8, 2022. The music video for ""Rx"", the title track, was released on April 9, 2022. He would soon embark on his 'TOURx' 2022 world tour.

On August 25, 2022, he released the single ""cross your mind"" alongside an official music video. He released another single ""a little more time"" on February 17, 2023, with a music video shot and directed by his girlfriend Emma Chamberlain.

ROLE MODEL took his name from Paul Rudd's character in the 2008 film ""Role Models"". He often plays acoustic guitar in his songs, and his music has been described as pop and bedroom pop. He has called Mac Miller an inspiration of his due to his influence on the city of Pittsburgh, and called meeting him ""the most pivotal moment in his life"". Critics have described his lyrics, which discuss topics such as sex, mental health, and relationships, as ""relatable"" and ""confessional"". Throughout his career, Pillsbury has been very open about mental health issues and his own depression.

He was signed to Benny Blanco's Mad Love Records label. He is close friends with fellow artist Omar Apollo. As of 2019, he is based in Hollywood. He was previously in a relationship with American social media influencer and model Emma Chamberlain. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Role+Model"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

167,167,fitz and the tantrums,1564016,22522776,"Fitz and the Tantrums is an American soul group from Los Angeles, California. The group was founded in 2008 by Michael Fitzpatrick, who had begun writing soul music for a solo project on an old church organ he had purchased. He added friend James King to the group as an arranger and soon after expanded the band to a seven-piece, including several horns. Fitzpatrick shares the vocal duties with Noelle Scaggs. Other members include Joseph Karnes, Jeremy Ruzumna, and John Wicks.

The group's debut EP, Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1, was released in 2009. Dangerbird Records signed the group in 2010 and issued their first full-length album, Pickin' Up the Pieces, in August of that year. The album reached #15 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. Los Angeles Times music critic Ann Powers wrote, ""Fitz & the Tantrums is the kind of band that communicates best in concert, but this album serves as a fine proxy and party-starter."" Aly Comingore of the Santa Barbara Independent wrote that the band members craft ""soulful, nostalgia pop that's not only infectious, but just fresh enough to make it stand apart from its predecessors.""

In 2010 the group opened several dates on tour with Maroon 5. On January 12, 2011, Fitz & the Tantrums performed the songs ""MoneyGrabber"" and ""Don't Gotta Work It Out"" on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live in Los Angeles. In 2010 the groups music video for the song ""MoneyGrabber"" was incorporated into the opening scene of a sixth season episode of the CBS crime-drama Criminal Minds entitled ""Safe Haven"".

Fitzpatrick has said that the band's musical style can be fairly described as ""soul-influenced indie pop"". He noted that while the band is influenced by the classic songs of the Motown and Stax record labels, the band is not trying to create an exact replica of that music. In another interview, Fitzpatrick talked about his decision to not use guitars in the band. ""I did want to try and make a big sounding record without guitars,"" he said. ""For me, I just feel like in any music that has a band, the guitar is always there, it's always featured, it's always prevalent. I'm just sick of hearing it.""

In 2012, the band signed to Elektra Records, and started to record their major-label debut More Than Just A Dream, which will be released on May 7, 2013. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Fitz+and+the+Tantrums"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

171,171,foals,1946079,96255740,"Foals is a rock band which formed in Oxford, England in 2005.  The band consists of Yannis Philippakis (vocals, guitar), Jimmy Smith (guitar), Walter Gervers (bass) and Jack Bevan (drums). The band has released seven albums: ""Antidotes"" (2008), ""Total Life Forever"" (2010), ""Holy Fire"" (2013), ""What Went Down"" (2015), ""Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost, Pt. 1"" (2019) , ""Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost, Pt. 2"" (2019), and ""Life is Yours"" (2022). In January 2018, it was announced that Walter Gervers (bass) was leaving the band. Edwin Congreave (keyboard) announced his departure in September 2021. In May 2023, Gervers was reported as having re-joined the band.

The band was formed in 2005 by Philippakis and Bevan, both former members of math rock band The Edmund Fitzgerald, and Andrew Mears of Youthmovies. Mears left the band after their first single to focus on Youthmovies. In January 2018, it was announced that Walter Gervers was also leaving the band.

In early 2007, the band released the limited edition 7"" singles Hummer and Mathletics, both produced by Gareth Parton. In the summer of 2007 Foals began working on their debut album in New York. It was produced by Dave Sitek of TV On The Radio, however, the band decided to mix the album themselves, stating that Sitek made the first master copy of the album sound like ""it was recorded in the Grand Canyon"". Yannis has stated multiple times during various interviews that Foals and Dave Sitek are on good terms, even though the copy by Sitek was rejected by the band. 

Foals released their debut album, entitled Antidotes, on 24 March 2008 in the UK and 8 April 2008 in the US. The album was a commercial success in the United Kingdom, debuting at No. 3 in the UK Albums Charts. The album was a minor success in other countries, charting in Japan, France and the Netherlands. Non-UK versions of the album include the early Parton produced singles.

In August 2009, Foals started recording their second album at Svenska Grammofon Studion in Gothenburg, Sweden. The album, Total Life Forever, has been described by the band members as sounding like ""tropical prog"" and ""like the dream of an eagle dying"". The band have described the album as being ""a lot less funk"" than they had originally planned. The album was produced by Luke Smith, formerly of Clor, and its title is named after an element of Ray Kurzweil's theory of singularity. The band's frontman Yannis Philippakis has professed a long time interest in futurology, with it informing numerous songs on Total Life Forever.

On 1 March 2010, the promotional single ""Spanish Sahara"" was first played on Zane Lowe's show Radio 1. Foals' new website was updated that night with the release of a video for the track directed by longtime collaborator Dave Ma. On 6 March, the Total Life Forever site was officially launched. Puzzles revealed images, lyrics and sound clips of songs from the album. The last clip appeared on 12 March, and resulted with a password entry for the Foals' new website. The site was opened on 13 March and presented the whole new art concept and media including samples of songs, photos and videos. Lead single ""This Orient"" was released on 3 May 2010. The album was finally released on 10 May 2010. ""Spanish Sahara"" was later released as a full physical single in September 2010, featuring an edited remix starring the strings of London Contemporary Orchestra. The album was nominated for the 2010 Mercury Prize.

176,176,the warning,145803,6012356,"There are multiple artists tracked on this page. 

1) The Warning are a rock band originating from Monterrey, Mexico. The band was formed in 2013 by the Villarreal Vélez sisters: Daniela (guitar, lead and backing vocals, piano), Paulina (drums, lead and backing vocals, piano), and Alejandra (bass guitar, piano, backing vocals). They have released four studio albums, two EPs, and eight music videos. Their latest studio album, Keep Me Fed, was released on June 28th, 2024.

The Villarreal Vélez sisters were raised in Monterrey, and all received training on various instruments at an early age. At some point in their childhood, Daniela and Paulina had selected guitar and drums as their primary instruments, respectively. When the youngest of the three, Alejandra, selected bass guitar as her primary instrument at about age 7, the sisters decided to form a rock power trio in 2013. They learned to play rock songs, often via the Rock Band video game series, and posted videos of their performances on YouTube.

In 2014, 12-year-old Paulina was profiled in the women's drumming publication Tom Tom Magazine. The band first gained widespread notice later in 2014 when, at ages 9 through 14, their YouTube video in which they performed Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"" went viral among rock music fans, eventually earning more than 20 million views. The video received attention from Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett, who offered particular praise for Paulina, saying, ""The drummer kicks maximum ass!""

Due to notice gained from their ""Enter Sandman"" video, The Warning decided to seek a record deal and develop their songs. They raised money through a successful GoFundMe appeal to record the six-song EP Escape the Mind, which was released in 2015. During the production of the EP, the band met producer Jake Carmona, who went on to contribute to Escape the Mind and their next three albums. In April 2015, the band appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. During this period the sisters raised funds, including a donation from DeGeneres and the Target Corporation, to attend a five-week training program at Berklee College of Music in the United States.

They also gave two presentations at the TEDx conference at the University of Nevada in 2016 and 2017.[17][18] The band was known for practicing with the Rock Band video game series early in their history; designers returned the favor by including several songs by The Warning in the 2018 edition of the series.[19][20]

The Warning's first full-length album, XXI Century Blood, was released in 2017. During this period they were invited to perform at the Mother of All Rock Festival in Monterrey and also opened a show for The Killers in that city. Their second album Queen of the Murder Scene was released in November 2018. They announced an extensive upcoming tour throughout North America in late 2019, though it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In August 2020, The Warning signed a five-album deal with Lava Records, and began work on a new album with producer David Bendeth. The song ""Choke"" was released in May 2021. Later that year, The Warning appeared on the Metallica tribute album The Metallica Blacklist, performing another cover of ""Enter Sandman"", this time with singer Alessia Cara. The six-song EP Mayday was released in October 2021, and The Warning embarked on a tour of North America in early 2022, performing more than 30 dates as headliners plus opening for Foo Fighters, Sammy Hagar and the Circle, and Stone Temple Pilots. They released the single ""Money"" in March 2022, and the song reached no. 31 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Airplay chart. The full-length album Error, comprising the six tracks from the Mayday EP plus ""Money"" and seven new songs, was released in June 2022. In July 2022, they embarked on a U.S. tour supporting Halestorm and The Pretty Reckless and appearing at festivals like Burlington's Sound of Music Festival, Iceberg Alley, Summerfest, and Upheaval, before resuming their headlining tour in August 2022. In the Fall of 2022, The Warning performed at additional festivals (Louder Than Life, Aftershock, Peninsula Tecate, Rock al Parque), supported a second US tour with Halestorm, a Canada tour with Three Days Grace, a Guns N' Roses tour stop in their home city of Monterrey, Mexico, and performed small-venue concerts in Las Vegas, California, and Lima, Peru. The band supported Muse during several dates on the Will of the People World Tour in both Mexico and Europe. In September 2023, they opened for Guns N' Roses again on two dates of the We're F'N' Back! Tour. In early 2024, the band announced on social media that their fourth studio album Keep Me Fed will be released in June 2024. In March 2024 three new singles from the upcoming album were released: ""S!CK"", ""Hell You Call a Dream"" and ""Que Mas Quieres"".

177,177,lila downs,205819,2829796,"Lila Downs (born Ana Lila Downs Sánchez on 9 September 1969 in Tlaxiaco) is a Mexican singer and actress. She performs her own compositions and the works of others in multiple genres, as well as tapping into Mexican traditional and popular music.

Downs grew up there and in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She began singing ranchera music at an early age, and later sang at the fiestas of the towns in her mountain region, la Mixteca. She sang with the band Los Cadetes de Yodoyuxi and later with La Trova Serrana, a group of folk musicians from the Zapotec town of Guelatao, Oaxaca. At that time she met her musical collaborator Paul Cohen and began to create her own musical compositions, which tap into native Mesoamerican music of the Mixtec, Zapotec, Maya and Nahuatl cultures. Cohen went on to become both Downs's husband and her artistic director. 

Downs is the daughter of Mixtec cabaret singer Anita Sánchez and Allen Downs, a Scottish/English-American professor of art and cinematographer from Minnesota. She grew up partly in the Mexican state of Oaxaca, partly in California as a teen, and Minnesota as an adult where she  studied voice and social anthropology at the University of Minnesota.  She also studied in a school of fine arts (Bellas Artes) in Oaxaca when she later returned to Mexico where she learned to weave. 

In following the years, Downs and her band toured widely in Mexico, South America, the US and Europe. She was also heard in a duet with Caetano Veloso for the soundtrack to the movie Frida in a song, Burn it Blue, that was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song and that she performed at the 75th Academy Awards. Other songs that she performed on the soundtrack are ""Benediction and Dream,"" ""Estrella Oscura,"" and ""La Llorona."" Other movies with a Lila Downs song are Tortilla Soup, Real Women Have Curves and Fados by Carlos Saura. She was also invited to the Twelve Girls Band's concert in Shanghai, where she sings in French and English. Downs is currently based in Coyoacán, a borough of Mexico City.

Downs 2008 album is ""Ojo de Culebra / Shake Away"" and includes ""I Envy The Wind"" (song) by Lucinda Williams and ""I Would Never"" by The Blue Nile. She also collaborates with artists like La Mari (singer) from Chambao (band) and Enrique Bunbury from Héroes del Silencio.

Getting closer to the ""real"" story, here's a poignant, fascinating bio of Lila Downs, by an excellent writer:

Lila Downs: With a Song in Her Soul
Lorenza Muñoz, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer

     Lila Downs OAXACA, Mexico--Lila Downs knelt onstage, as if in prayer, in a dark auditorium, only a few dim lights reflected off her onyx-black hair and ruby-red lips. Before a hometown crowd, she directed her prayer-like song to La Llorona. Downs' powerful voice echoed off the stage. Suddenly she became La Llorona--a mythical woman said to haunt the river valleys of Mexico, weeping and moaning for her children whom she drowned in a fit of madness. Her story has been repeated for centuries in Mexican folklore, with a little variation but always the same tragic feeling.

The hushed audience watched her, transfixed, as she knelt in her traditional silk black and red blouse, a huipil, calling out in agony and adoration to the ghost of La Llorona:

    You came out of the church one day Llorona and I saw you pass by Such a beautiful huipil you were wearing, Llorona that I thought you were the virgin. Oh my Llorona, Llorona dressed in a celestial blue And even if it costs me my life, Llorona, I will not stop adoring you.

    Lila DownsShe ended her song, and for several seconds the audience members seemed not to breathe or move until they heaved a collective sigh. They had been transported to an imaginary place. They had just experienced Lila Downs at her best.

    If Downs' performances are marked by anything, it is an uncanny ability to become the character of a song. Whether it is La Llorona, or a sensual jazz singer of ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" in flawless English, or a coquettish Mexican singing a bolero, or a native Indian conveying the sad stories of Mexico's Mixtec, Nahuatl or Zapotec cultures in their languages, Downs discovers a part of herself in the essence in each song. She is a reflection of a 21st century world culture where ethnicity and national boundaries are blurred.

    The 32-year-old is best known in Los Angeles for her electrifying performance at last year's World Festival of Sacred Music. Downs received a standing ovation that night, an honor given to only one other festival participant--the Dalai Lama.

    Lila DownsShe has sung before packed houses at the Getty and at LunaPark. In 1998, she performed live on KPFK-FM (90.7). The CD of that performance, a modest endeavor with only acoustic guitar and piano accompaniment, has been the biggest-selling benefit album in KPFK history, said operations director Betto Arcos. At the Sacred Music Festival, ""she was singing in Mixtec, Maya, Nahuatl and she stole the heart of not just Latinos but everyone,"" Arcos said.

    A relative newcomer to the music scene, with only two albums released, Downs and her band recently signed a deal with Narada/Virgin records, a company that also distributes other global music acts and labels, including Peter Gabriel's Real World and David Byrne's Luaka Bop. Her first album for Narada, tentatively scheduled for release Aug. 29, will be original songs written by Downs inspired by border life. The music will include cumbias, rancheras and other eclectic mixes. Monday, Downs returns to Los Angeles for a performance at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre. Downs' bicultural background, her exotic beauty and startling voice, in addition to the growing popularity of world music, could position her to reach international success.

    ""I was struck by her voice and the commitment that she has made to her cultural background--she integrates it in a very modern way that makes it accessible,"" said Richard Denhart, senior director of artists and repertoire for Narada. ""I think of her as a developing artist. She really has no track record, and so it is a challenge to get her to the United States as much as possible to get her music out.""

    Indeed, having sung professionally for only seven years, she is still ironing out the kinks in her voice. Some critics say her eclectic song selection and arrangement obstruct the flow of her albums. To get to the next level, they believe, she must refine her performances and find a top-notch producer.

    ""She doesn't have a perfect voice, but she sure can perform,"" said Tom Schnabel, host of ""Cafe L.A."" on KCRW-FM (89.9). ""Her strength is the way she can win a crowd. Look, Maria Callas used to blow notes right and left, but she would also blow an audience away. Same with Lila. She has a hell of a lot of stage presence. She can emote and be very dramatic.""

    Drama has been a constant presence in Lila Downs' life. There is an aura about her that suggests something ethereal. She is thin, with thick straight hair pulled tight into two braids often decorated by the brightly colored ribbons of her native Oaxacan Zapotec and Mixtec Indian culture--a look that has existed for centuries, but which painter Frida Kahlo popularized in the 1930s. Wearing no makeup, she dons only a dark cherry or red lipstick when she performs. Her skin, a light olive shade that allows for very light freckles to form on her nose, is in stark contrast to her dark hair, ink-black eyes and arched eyebrows. Her scent is of a musk oil, sensually perfuming the air around her.

    Downs' mother, Anita, a willful, intelligent woman, decided at an early age that she would escape the chains of her ancient village. Born in San Miguel El Grande, deep in the mountains of Oaxaca, Anita was married off to an abusive man at age 15. One night as her husband snored off the day's drunken adventure, she escaped to Mexico City, literally barefoot, penniless and barely able to speak Spanish.

    Being a quick study, Anita became fluent in Spanish, though never forgetting her native Mixtec. Being a striking beauty, she quickly found a job singing at a cabaret.

    It was there one night in 1961 that Allen Downs appeared in her life. An adventurous professor of art and cinematography, Downs had come to Mexico to film the flight of the blue-winged teal from Canada to the Yucatan Peninsula. But when he set his eyes on Anita, Downs quickly forgot about the ducks.

    ""He had never seen a Mixtequita like me,"" recalled Anita, in slightly accented Spanish, laughing at the memory. ""Even though he didn't speak Spanish and I didn't speak English, we understood each other.""

    There was one little snag in their love affair, however. Allen Downs was married. Within a few years, he secured a divorce, moved to Mexico City and married Anita. He wanted to have a baby right away. Wanting to make sure her husband was responsible and would stick around, however, Anita decided to wait. She waited seven years.

    Finally, in 1968, their baby girl, named Lila, was born.

    Lila lived a double life. Oaxaca was too remote for their daughter, so her father brought her as a teen to Southern California, where his brother lived. At Rowland Heights High School, she learned to read and write English perfectly. Anita opted to stay home in Mexico. So Downs spent most of her teenage years with her father.

    When she graduated from high school, she came home to Oaxaca. But here, her identity crisis began setting in. She saw the uglier, racist, envious side of Mexico. Who was this strange child of a strapping, white American father and a petite, bronze-colored Indian mother? In a country still suffering from the scars of many conquests over the Indians, Downs was the personification of everything many Mexicans loathe and yet desperately want to be.

    ""It was very, very hard,"" Downs recollected. ""I think what I do artistically had a lot to do with me as a person. I was very confused.""

    Her neighbors would tease her. ""You're the little Indian's daughter,"" the children would taunt. ""Yankee go home,"" they would write in graffiti on the family house.

    She sang, but only to her mother. The notion of performing publicly was embarrassing; it reminded her of the way her mother had made a living standing on nightclub tables, surrounded by drunkards.

    Suddenly one day, while taking a nap during a visit to Oaxaca, Allen Downs died of a heart attack at 68. Downs, 16 at the time, was the only other person in the house. His death is a topic she still finds difficult to talk about. She flew into a rebellion, angry that her father was dead, taking it out on her mother who in her eyes was helpless, almost submissive to the discrimination she faced in a society that resents its Indian ancestry.

    ""Up to that point I had spent time with my dad--the white guy,"" Downs said. ""I realized that people treated me better because I was with a man--and [especially] a white man. And then suddenly I was left with my Indian mommy. I couldn't handle it. How could I deal with the fact that my mother speaks with a thick accent because her first language was Mixtec? I was ashamed of my Indian roots.""

    Lila Downs Two years later, she fled to her father's native state of Minnesota for college and buried herself in studies. She studied voice and anthropology until her junior year, but then she became disillusioned. She dropped out for about a year and became a Deadhead, living and breathing the cult-like fascination with the Grateful Dead. Soon she realized she had stopped feeling and thinking for herself. She was, she recalls, like a stoned, unbathed android, unable to put her own emotions to life. She stopped singing--not a note--thinking it a vain and superficial exercise.

    Her mother, an elegant, finely kept woman, was horrified.

    ""I never thought she would dress like that--or that a human being would dress like that and smell like that!"" Anita recalled, her eyes widening in disdain. ""Her boyfriend had so much hair, he looked like a lamb.""

    To Lila, that stage in her life was inevitable. ""It was good because it was like shedding a skin and going through a growing process which we all go through one way or another.""

    After two years of therapy and serious introspection, Downs snapped out of the Deadhead mode, returned to the University of Minnesota and received her degrees in voice and anthropology in 1991. But she still felt she was searching for something. She was still unable to sing. It was not until she returned to Mexico that she found the healing qualities of music.

    Through music, Downs discovered herself, her Mexican and Indian heritage.

    But her link would be soaked in the tragedy that has haunted the Indians of Oaxaca for centuries. Even before the Spanish conquest, her mother's people had been overrun, first by the Zapotecs--a neighboring Indian civilization--and then by the Aztecs, who changed their language, stole their gold and imposed their ways. Today, Oaxaca's enemy is poverty.

    One day, home in Oaxaca, Downs was asked by her fellow Mixtecos to translate death certificates in English to their language. Many of their boys who had crossed the border into the United States searching for work had died. And though their bodies had been shipped back to their native land, their relatives wanted to know how they had died.

    It was so powerful, being this translator of death. She had to sing about it, to honor these boys with so little time on Earth. She composed ""Ofrenda"" (Offering).

    ""It took a long time to decide that I wanted to sing,"" she said. ""I needed something that was a little more intellectual and that motivated me. That is why I started to write.""

    In 1993, she resumed singing, performing in Oaxacan nightclubs, where she met Paul Cohen, an American saxophonist from the East Coast. They hit it off, becoming romantically involved and collaborating musically. Cohen is today the chief arranger of Downs' songs. With his encouragement she explored the grand Mexican ballads, the rancheras, the boleros, the ancient codices of the Mixtecs and Zapotecs and put them to music. Her mother encouraged her to dig deep for that emotion--sentimiento--she possessed but never really brought out.

    Indeed, most audiences seem to forgive her occasional vocal missteps. This was true during a February performance in Oaxaca, where her most fervent fans have rare occasion to see her live. Although she lives in Mexico City, she is considering moving permanently to Los Angeles. Lately, as her fame has increased, her time at home in Oaxaca has been reduced to a few weekends a year. So, many of her friends and relatives, who had come to see their local girl sing on this cool night, brought their affection and love, showering her with flowers and accolades. Her fans, mind you, were not only Oaxacans. A group of visiting Minnesotans heard one of their own was singing that night.

    ""We flew in from Minneapolis and we are just as proud as peacocks!"" said Marge Nordstrom as she shook Downs' hand backstage. ""I'm a music teacher, so I know what I heard. We certainly hope you come to Minneapolis soon.""

    Downs graciously shook everyone's hand, accepted the roses she was handed by petite Indian girls looking up to her as a near-idol. Though smiling, her exhaustion and nervousness was visible on her face. ""It is like dying a little bit every time you do pieces like 'La Llorona' because they mean so much to people,"" she said later. ""It's like a love song to death.""

    The idea of fame makes her uncomfortable. It brings new questions: As her popularity increases, will she be able to handle the demands on her time? Will the new record company force her to sing music that is more popular but not as heartfelt? Without her heart and soul into it, she knows she could never continue singing.

    ""I never appreciated being a vocalist. I thought it was so superficial,"" Downs said. ""You have to find the spirit to the songs, otherwise it doesn't matter how pretty you sing. I can't quite explain what it is, but I think it has something to do with getting to know yourself and feeling right about what you're doing.""

Lila Downs has one of the world’s most singular voices and innovative approaches to music. She is the daughter of a Mixtec Indian woman, Anastasia Sanchez, who ran away from her village at 15 to sing in Mexico City cantinas and a University of Minnesota professor Allen Downs, who saw her singing and fell in love.

Lila grew up both in Minnesota and Oaxaca, and her music and vocal artistry has many influences, including the folk and ranchera music of Mexico and South America and American folk, jazz, blues and hip-hop. Many of her lyrics focus on issues relating to social justice, and often tell the stories of the workers who migrate from rural Mexico to work in the U.S. She studied classical voice and cultural anthropology at the University of Minnesota. “The Mexican American singer has a stunning voice, a confident multicultural vision grounded in her Mixtec Indian roots,” Los Angeles Times. “Ms. Downs has multiple voices, from an airborne near-falsetto down to a forthright alto and a sultry, emotive contralto,” New York Times.

She and her husband / longtime collaborator, Paul Cohen, have produced 10 studio albums, with “Pecados y Milagros” having earned both a Grammy and a Latin Grammy award, and achieving double-platinum in sales in Mexico. She received her first Latin Grammy for the 2004 release, “Una Sangre.” Her current project, “RAÍZ,” is a collaboration with Argentinian singer Soledad Pastorutti and Spanish flamenco singer La Niña Pastori. This album has garnered two 2014 Latin Grammy nominations for “Album of the Year” and “Best Folk Album.”

Lila Downs has performed at many of the world’s most prestigious festivals and venues including Jazz at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall and the Festival of Sacred Music – Hollywood Bowl. She has been invited to sing at the White House, and performed on the 75th Annual Academy Awards and the 2012 Latin Grammy Awards televised ceremonies.

Her music has also been included in several feature films such as “The Counselor”, “Tortilla Soup,” “Real Women Have Curves,” “The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada,” Carlos Saura’s “Fados,” “Mariachi Gringo” and “Hecho en Mexico”.

2. Palace is one of the many monikers that has been used at one point or another by American singer and songwriter, Will Oldham (1970). From 1993 to 1997, Oldham performed and recorded in collaboration with dozens of other musicians under many different variations of Palace (Palace, Palace Flophouse, Palace Brothers, Palace Songs, Palace Music). From 1998 onwards he started calling himself Bonnie 'Prince' Billy. Oldham released just one record as Palace: 1995's The Mountain EP, although it is now listed on streaming platforms under Palace Music. Oldham says this EP, recorded in the winter time, features some of his darkest, most challenging songs.

He released periodic singles over the next year-and-a-half until landing a distribution deal with Interscope for his label Still Woozy Productions. They released the debut EP Lately EP in May 2019. It contained ""Habit,"" which became his biggest hit since ""Goodie Bag.""

Still Woozy returned with more original material in 2020, including ""Window"" and ""Cheesin',"" the latter a collaborative track for Republic Records with artists including Cautious Clay, Remi Wolf, and Claud.

195,195,xylø,276613,4058250,"XYLØ is the alias of American singer-songwriter Paige Duddy (born August 8, 1994) . From 2015 to 2018, XYLØ was a musical duo that consisted of Paige Duddy and her brother Chase. Since 2018, Paige has embarked on a solo career and has continued to release her new music under the XYLØ moniker.

Raised in a musical family, Paige fell in love with singing and writing her own lyrics at the influential age of 13. By the time she was 18, she had honed these skills and was collaborating with her older brother, Chase Duddy. In 2016, XYLØ released their debut EP, embarked on national tours, performed at countless festivals, accumulated millions of streams and earned a platinum plaque for their collaboration with The Chainsmokers on the song, “Setting Fires” (by The Chainsmokers featuring XYLØ). After the release of their successful single “I Still Wait For You” in 2017, XYLØ evolved into a whole new musical artist. Having grown up behind the mic, Paige found her own powerful voice; one that currently resonates worldwide - both sonically and lyrically. She and her brother mutually parted ways, allowing her to shine and him to pursue his own endeavors. 

2018 is a new chapter for XYLØ and an emergence for Paige as a solo artist. “I’ve spent the last 9 months discovering myself as a young woman and as a singer/musician - with all the ups and downs that brings. The new music is about what I’ve gone through during this time, from living on my own for the first time, to facing the changing relationships in my life.""

Four EPs named pretty sad (2019), yes & no (2019), The Ganglands of My Heart (2020) and OUTSIDERS CLUB (2020) self-released by XYLØ under Pretty Records.

196,196,willow,1815874,59576169,"There are at least six artists with this name:
1. Willow Smith, an American pop singer
2. An American instrumental group
3. A Belgian indie rock band
4. An American singer/songwriter
5. A Dutch rock band
6. An American math rock band
7. Sophie Wilson, a UK-based producer.
8. German hard rock band, 1990s.

1. Willow Camille Reign Smith (born October 31, 2000 in Los Angeles, United States) is an American child actress and singer who is the daughter of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. She made her acting debut in 2007 in the film I Am Legend, and was most successful in the film Kit Kittredge: An American Girl where she won the Young artist award for Best Performance in a Feature Film. Apart from her acting she launched a music career in the fall of 2010 with the release of her debut single “Whip My Hair” and signing to Jay-Z’s record label Roc Nation. Willow has released 4 studio albums; her debut, ARDIPITHECUS released in 2015, The 1st released in 2017, WILLOW released in 2019 and lately I feel EVERYTHING released in 2021. She is also part of THE ANXIETY, a collaborative project with Tyler Cole. The projects debut album, THE ANXIETY, was released in 2020.

2. Willow was a four piece instrumental group from Newnan, GA.
Kyle Coleman-Drums/Fast Driving, Matt McClellan-Bass/Keys/Jingle Bells, Tanner Merritt-Guitar/Funny Faces & Rob Sepanski-Mandolin/Violin/Noise 

3. Willow is a young Belgian indie rock band that started in 2007. They create solid, semi-danceable, catchy popsongs with hints of new wave. In their short existence Willow won several rockcontests, with most notably Rockvonk 2009. In 2010 they became 3rd in Humo’s Rock Rally and won the KBC public’s choice award. They are known for their energetic live performance and their refreshing take on music history while still being capable of maintaining their own sound.

4. Willow is a self-taught singer/songwriter, who, in 1992 put down her Bible and picked up a pawn shop guitar. Three chords later, the songs came flowing out. Judging from the fact that she had no subsequent musical experience, one could say she’s a bit of a preternatural chanteuse. Like post-Christian rocker contemporaries, Alice Cooper and Marilyn Manson, Willow’s papa is a preacher man and prior to her fateful leap, she was an enrollee at Multnomah School of the Bible in Portland Oregon. The result of her departure from conservative religion…her musical renderings are of an evolution of a spiritual nature - an earthly, poetic dance in the dark. For those familiar with the fire and brimstone of artist Nick Cave, Willow may be the polar sweet angel of darkness, redemption and desire.

5. Willow was a rock-band from The Hague, The Netherlands. The band was formed by Marlein Heskes-Duarte and Rui Duarte. They’ve had multiple guitar players in the 6 years they made music. The music also changed everytime a new guitar player entered the band. Started out as an alternative rock band, they soon changed their sound to a more punk-rock sound, and in the last year added a nu-metal vibe to their sound.
Willow had some succes in their hometown and surroundings, having played more than a 100 shows, including the Paard van Troje, Plein Open festival, HOT festival and recorded a videoclip in the local tv-studio “TV West” for the song Spinning Around.
The Duarte’s have recently started a new band called Man-Made Madness, which also includes ex-Willow guitar-player Jordy Licht.

6. Willow is a math rock trio from Providence, Rhode Island, United States. Their debut EP, ""Roanoke"" was issued in 2012.

7. Sophie Wilson AKA Willow first made her introduction in 2014 when her debut Feel Me caused a stir when ambient techno veteran Move D included it on his Fabric 74 mix. A year later, the song finally received a proper release on Workshop's compilation EP Workshop 21 – the sub-heavy house tune with an earworm R&B vocal was a highlight on the LP which was number 6 in Resident Advisor tracks of 2015.
 
Rewind two years to the start of an on-going residency in Nottingham for 808, the chance to play alongside Anton Zap, Fred P, Tama Sumo and of course Move D, have shaped and crafted her tastes and DJ style which ranges from house to techno and all that falls in-between.

199,199,beirut,1620240,88743636,"Beirut is an American indie-rock and world music band which was originally the solo musical project of  Zach Condon (born Zachary Francis Condon in Santa Fe, New Mexico) and later expanded into a band. The band's first performances were in New York, in May 2006, to support the release of their debut album, Gulag Orkestar.

Condon recorded before Beirut was established: when he was fifteen and under the name of Realpeople, he made an electronic record, fashioned after his love for The Magnetic Fields. Condon was a straight-A student until he dropped out at the age of 17 to travel Europe with his cousin in a drunken haze, cavorting and partying with the locals wherever he ended up. It was during one of these evenings that he was first exposed to Balkan music (notably including the Boban Marković Orkestar and Goran Bregović), blasting from the upstairs apartment. Condon ended up with the Serbian artists all night, going through albums country by country, note for note. 

The first album under the Beirut moniker, Gulag Orkestar (2006), was the direct result of what he learned that night. While it may sound like an entire Balkan orchestra playing modern songs as mournful ballads and upbeat marches, the album was performed and recorded almost entirely by Condon alone. He did so on Pro Tools while skipping school in Albuquerque and at Sea Side Studios in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Jeremy Barnes added percussion and some violin overlays.

After recording, Condon formed a full band which at times varies in the number of members, from six to ten. Live he is accompanied by Perrin Cloutier (cello/accordion), Jason Poranski (guitar/mandolin/ukulele), Nick Petree (drums), Kristin Ferebee (violin), Paul Collins (organ/keys/tambourine/ukulele), Jon Natchez (baritone sax/mandolin/glockenspiel), and Kelly Pratt (trumpet/euphonium).

In November 2006 Condon was ""briefly hospitalized for extreme exhaustion"", the band's website said, and as a consequence the band cancelled the rest of the tour. They resumed performing in March 2007 and released their second album, The Flying Club Cup the same year on October 9th. Parts of the album were performed and recorded by Condon in his bedroom again, but others were recorded with the live band, which resulted in a more organic, live sound. While writing, Condon said he was inspired by French music, like Jacques Brel (whose song Le Moribond he covered on his Elephant Gun EP), and he moved to Paris for a while. During the extensive tour in support of The Flying Club Cup, Condon and the band more or less fell apart from exhaustion once again and disappeared from the radar in April 2008. 

Condon took a long break and returned in 2009 with a double EP, March of the Zapotec & Realpeople: Holland. The first was partly recorded in Mexico with the Mexican Band Jimenez and had a more South-American flavour to it than Condon's previous efforts. The second EP 'Holland' was credited to Condon's old name Realpeople and consisted of five electrotracks, once more in the vein of The Magnetic Fields.

The band's album ""The Rip Tide"" was released in 2011.

206,206,ethel cain,878819,73297820,"Hayden Silas Anhedönia (born March 24, 1998), known professionally as Ethel Cain, is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, and model. She is noted for her lyrics focused on nostalgic and Southern Gothic themes, while her music has been associated with the ambient, indie rock, and contemporary folk genres. While Ethel Cain is her main project, Anhedönia has other projects under different monikers, such as ΛTLΛS, Miss Anhedönia, Tommy, White Silas, and אשמדאי.

Cain released multiple recordings under various aliases before officially starting her main project in mid-2019. Three extended plays (EPs) preceded her debut studio album, Preacher's Daughter, which was released in 2022 to acclaim from music critics—many of whom called it one of the best albums of the year. Following its release, she garnered a cult following online. Her studio recording Perverts followed in 2025.

Anhedönia was born on March 24, 1998, in Tallahassee, Florida, and raised in Perry. She is the eldest of four children in a Southern Baptist family. Her father was a deacon, and she was involved in the church choir from a young age, like her mother. At age 8, Anhedönia began studying classical piano, with musical influences from a variety of Christian music. The church was Anhedönia's first exposure to music: ""My whole life was always singing, always, always music all the time"", she said. She left the church at the age of 16. Anhedönia was homeschooled.

Anhedönia officially started making music in 2017, experimenting with ""dreamy bedroom pop demos"". Her first extended play under the Ethel Cain moniker, Carpet Bed, consisted of four songs and was released on September 13, 2019. Months later, she released her second EP, Golden Age, on December 1. After the latter's release, she was backed by the artist Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, who praised her for her ""mature songwriting and understanding of melody"". In January 2020, after recommendation from Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, Cain was discovered by the rapper Lil Aaron while headlining a show with Edith Underground, Girlfiend, and Lil Bo Weep in Los Angeles. She was then invited by him to meet with the publishing company Prescription Songs and signed with them soon after.

In February 2021, Anhedönia released her first single as Ethel Cain and under the new publishing contract, ""Michelle Pfeiffer"", which featured Lil Aaron. The song was described by Billboard as alternative rock, folk, and ""even country"". Her second single, ""Crush"", followed on March 18 and received a music video on August 3. The two singles were part of her third EP, Inbred, which was released on April 23. The ambient-folk and slowcore EP was named by Pitchfork as one of The 49 Most Anticipated Albums of Spring 2021 and received a score of 7.6 out of 10 by the website. Later on August 24, a stripped version of ""Crush"" was also published. On March 8, 2022, she released a cover of the song ""Everytime"" by Britney Spears as part of Spotify Singles, in observance of International Women's Day.

On March 17, 2022, Cain released the single ""Gibson Girl"" and subsequently announced her debut album, titled Preacher's Daughter and released on May 12, 2022, through her own record label, Daughters of Cain. A concept album that creates a narrative ""centered around the character Ethel Cain"", it received a positive reception from music critics and was named one of the best albums of the year. It was also preceded by the release of the singles ""Strangers"" on April 7 and ""American Teenager"" on April 21, the latter receiving a music video on July 21. In support of the album, Cain embarked on the Freezer Bride Tour in 2022 and the Blood Stained Blonde Tour in 2023. She was also an opening act at one concert of Florence and the Machine's Dance Fever Tour and Caroline Polachek's Spiraling Tour.

Cain performed at the 22nd Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2023. On June 3, 2023, Cain fainted on stage while performing at the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia, as part of Vivid Live, resulting in the show's cancellation. She returned to performing the next day. She also performed at Reading Festival and Gunnersbury Park with Boygenius and Muna in August 2023. On December 5, 2023, Cain announced the Childish Behaviour Tour, an eight-show tour that began on June 3, 2024, and was slated to end on June 27, 2024. After sharing the song on SoundCloud a year before, in 2023 she released ""Famous Last Words (An Ode to Eaters)"", inspired by Luca Guadagnino's film Bones and All, along with 1017 ALYX 9SM. With a ""darkly poignant"" music video, it was included in the project's first compilation album.

Cain placed on the Forbes 30 Under 30 2024 for Music. She opened for Mitski's 2024 concert tour in support of her album The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We (2023). On February 14, 2024, she released a song titled ""من النهر” (meaning ""From the River""), which she described as a ""prayer"" for Palestinians.

209,209,lagum,285080,16663684,"Lagum is a Brazilian pop and reggae band formed in 2014 in the city of Brumadinho, Minas Gerais. It is composed by Pedro Calais, Otavio Cardoso, Jorge, Francisco Jardim and formerly Tio Wilson.

It all started in 2014, in the city of Belo Horizonte, when Pedro Calais decided to post a video of one of his compositions on Facebook; a friend who was the promoter of events at a concert hall saw him and encouraged him to form a band to perform at the venue. Therefore, Calais decided to call his childhood friends Otavio Cardoso, Glauco Borges, Francisco Jardim and Breno Braga. The group started their career performing at this concert hall in the city, playing their own songs, which are credited to all of the band.

In May 2016, the quintet released their debut studio album titled Seja o Que Eu Querer. In February 2018, an acoustic version of the song ""Deixa"" was released in partnership with singer Ana Gabriela. The song, in this version, became a success, being among the most played in the country, giving visibility to the group to participate in television programs and sign a contract with the Sony record company. In June 2019, they released their second studio album named Things of the Generation.


On September 12, 2020, the band would perform two shows in drive-in format in the city of Nova Lima, Minas Gerais. However, drummer Tio Wilson (Breno Braga) had an indisposition in the interval between the two performances and died from a cardiorespiratory arrest. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lagum"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They are known for their high energy live performances and their pioneering use of social media, and are somewhat of an anomaly in today's music scene. Their sound is almost impossible to categorize, containing elements from almost all the musical movements of the past century.

The band was formed by brothers Axel and Pål Vindenes, together with school friends Jonas Nielsen and Stian Sævig. All classically trained musicians, the band was formed to play a one-off show at a local youth centre, Ungdomshuset 1880, but after positive response the band continued to play many live shows around Norway. In 2006, the band made their first recording and released the EP Already Your Favourite EP which was produced by Matias Tellez and featured the track ""OOO"".

Kakkmaddafakka released its first LP Down to Earth on 24 September 2007, which reached number twenty on the VG Topp30 Album list and brought the band nationwide attention in their native Norway, despite a largely negative critical response.

Kakkmaddafakka has performed at numerous festivals including Iceland Airwaves, Montreux Jazz Festival, NXNE, CMJ Music Marathon, Southside Festival, Hurricane Festival, Eurosonic Festival, by:Larm, Area 4 Hove and Melt! Festival in Germany, where they were introduced on stage by prominent Bergen musician and friend Erlend Øye.

In 2008, Kakkmaddafakka was nominated as Best Norwegian Act in the MTV Europe Music Awards, along with Madcon, Ida Maria, Karpe Diem and eventual winners Erik og Kriss.

On 25 February 2011, Kakkmaddafakka released their second album Hest. The album was produced by Erlend Øye and released on the label Bubbles. The first single taken from the album was ""Restless"".

On 28 June 2013, the band released their third album Six Months Is a Long Time. It was again produced by Erlend Øye and released on Universal Music Germany, featuring the singles ""Someone New"", ""Young"", and ""Forever Alone"".

In early 2014, pianist and founder member Jonas Nielsen left the band and was replaced by Sebastian Emin Kittelsen.

The band released their fourth album titled KMF on 18 March 2016. 

In 2017, guitarist and singer Pål Vindenes started a parallel solo project under the name Pish. 2017 also brought on their fifth album, Hus.

212,212,grandson,680381,19699988,"Grandson is an alternative artist hailing from Toronto, Canada. Born in the small town of Englewood New Jersey, he relocated to the cultural melting pot of Toronto at a young age, and grew up surrounded by music ranging from jazz to rock and roll to rap, dancehall and r&b. He began playing guitar and piano in high school.

At 17, he relocated to Montreal, QC to attend university, and began working in nightclubs cleaning tables and DJing. He started writing music at this time, incorporating the unique blend of sounds he grew up surrounded by. He started experimenting with music production and rapping in 2013, and dropped out of school to relocate to Los Angeles and pursue music full time.

Adopting the Grandson moniker while living in LA, he dove deeply into rock influences such as Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana, and Led Zeppelin, while also listening to rap/R&B music emerging out of Toronto and alternative acts such as Twenty One Pilots and Hiatus Kaiyote. He found a small community of musicians to work and perform with here in Los Angeles. The live tries to create a frantic, mosh pit-inducing cathartic release of energy for concert-goers, influenced by early punk and grunge music.

Searching for his voice and for meaning in today’s divisive, chaotic world, Grandson confronts the most pressing issues of his generation through his songwriting, such as financial inequality, governmental and environmental accountability, and social justice, giving these topics a soundtrack with a genuine sense of urgency and frustration. The music also touches on adolescence, relationships, and the insecurities and difficulties of growing up through your 20s. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Grandson"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

215,215,waterparks,550739,57289306,"Waterparks is an American rock band formed in Houston, Texas in 2011. The group currently consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Awsten Knight, backing vocalist and guitarist Geoff Wigington, and drummer Otto Wood.

The band has released three EPs, two of which (Airplane Conversations & Black Light)  were released independently with one released via Equal Vision (Cluster). Additionally, the band has released five studio albums (Double Dare, Entertainment, FANDOM, Greatest Hits and INTELLECUAL PROPERTY).

On November 6, 2015, the band signed with Equal Vision Records. After searching for producers, the band became managed by Benji Madden and Joel Madden. On November 6, 2015, the band released ""Crave"", the lead single off their first project with Equal Vision, the Cluster EP. On January 15, 2016, the group released Cluster, which was co-produced by Benji Madden and Courtney Ballard, with bass being performed by Mikey Way of My Chemical Romance. On November 19, 2015, the band performed with Good Charlotte during the group's comeback performance at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, California.

The group performed on the Black Cat Tour supporting Never Shout Never in 2016, and on every date of the 2016 Warped Tour. The band also performed on the End The Madness Tour supporting Sleeping with Sirens in late 2016. They played Slam Dunk festival in 2016 and 2017, and went on a headline tour of the UK with support from Chapel and The Bottom Line, selling out all dates. They toured the US in late 2017, with support from As It Is, Chapel and Sleep On It.

The group released a single titled ""Stupid For You"" on August 31, 2016 in promotion of their debut album, Double Dare, which was released on November 4, 2016. The album consists of 13 songs, and was preceded by 3 singles: ""Stupid For You""; ""Hawaii (Stay Awake)""; and ""Royal"". On January 26, 2017, the band released their second studio album Entertainment. The album includes 10 tracks, and was preceded by the singles ""Blonde"", ""Lucky People"", and ""Not Warriors"". 

You write a record, go on tour, endure a very public breakup, and pen more songs about what happened. Sound familiar? Well, this story sort of starts that way right before it makes a total 180 degree turn on a dime. 
...
Rather than talk about “doing something different"", Waterparks actually did. On the heels of landing their biggest chart and critical success to date on 2018’s Entertainment, the Houston, TX three piece - Awsten Knight [vocals, guitar], Otto Wood [drums], and Geoff Wigington [guitar] commenced writing again before scrapping everything. They reconfigured the vision, recalibrated the entire approach, and reinvented themselves. By doing so, the boys boldly break down walls between rock, pop, punk, hip-hop, alternative, indie, electronic, and even R&B with hashtaggable hooks and a level of gleeful playlist hopping mischief on their third full length, and Hopeless Records debut, FANDOM.  They went on the FANDOM Tour in 2019 and 2020, before the rest of the tour being cancelled. However, they recorded one of the shows, and released their first live album, FANDOM: LIVE IN THE UK in late 2020. 
                                                                                                                                    
Then on September 25, 2020, the band released their first single since FANDOM, ""Lowkey as Hell"", and announced they had signed to 300 Entertainment. Then, on February 26, 2021, they released ""Snow Globe"", and announced their fourth studio album, Greatest Hits. Four additional singles preceded the album's release: ""Numb"", ""You'd Be Paranoid Too (If Everyone Was Out To Get You)"", ""Just Kidding"", and  ""Violet!"". And on May 21, 2021, Greatest Hits was released. They reinvented themselves once again, making an album with influences from genres like hyperpop, pop, hip-hop, rock, punk, alternative, indie and even electronic and r&b. Since then, Greatest Hits has topped charts, gotten 25 million streams and and has led the band to perform on MTV. Waterparks has also started touring again, doing meet and greet shows in places like LA, NYC, Orlando, Baltimore, Houston, Seattle, Portland and Minneapolis. They also went on the A Night Out on Earth tour in fall 2021 across America with Zeph, Phem and Arrested Youth as openers.

Then, they started teasing new music. Awsten started an online clothing brand called Hii-Def. Then on March 9th, it was announced that the band was going on tour opening for My Chemical Romance on five dates  (Albany, Montreal, Toronto on two nights, Los Angeles).  Later that month, they announced they were going to play Sad Summer Fest from July 8th till August 5th across America with bands like State Champs, Mayday Parade, Hot Mulligan, Neck Deep and more. Then, in May they announced they had signed to Fueled by Ramen. Following that, they released the 1st single off of their fifth studio album, entitled FUNERAL GREY on May 14th, 2022.

During June, they went on the See You in The Future tour in Europe with Bad Suns and Phem as openers. They then went on the Sad Summer fest and released SELF-SABOTAGE on July 7, 2022, the same day as the 1st show of SSF in Sacramento. A week after starting the SSF tour, they announced they were opening for Blackbear’s Nothing Matters tour in September. On October 14th, 2022, they released FUCK ABOUT IT (feat. blackbear), the third single off their fifth studio album.

Yuksek born in 1977, native of Reims, France. Yuksek played the piano at the Conservatoire of Music until the age of 17 – the time he decided to give up his studies. After playing the piano for ten years at a conservatoire, he took part in several bands such as Klanguage, whose first album was released in 2007.

217,217,bonobo,1899672,101732798,"
Simon Green, known by his stage name Bonobo, is a British musician, producer and DJ based in Los Angeles.

Bonobo's first album - 2000's Animal Magic - was released via Tru Thoughts before being picked up by Ninja Tune. It announced him as a serious talent; able to bring a musician's edge to electronic music, with all the freedom that skill allowed. His subsequent albums for Ninja, Dial 'M' for Monkey and Days to Come, developed his sensibility, won him fans across the globe, and saw him develop his live show into a mesmeric re-working of his records. 

He has also worked hard as a DJ, a part of Green's arsenal that perhaps truly came into its own at the same time as 2010’s Black Sands. 2012 saw him take the uptempo, club re-edits of Black Sands from a seminal Boiler Room performance in London to dance floors across the world, and unveil a new light show that further enhanced the impact of these stunning songs. A remix album was released featuring reworkings by fans and peers such as Machinedrum, Floating Points, Mark Pritchard, Lapalux and FaltyDL. 

Later the same year, he finally settled down in his New York studio to write his fifth album. The North Borders was another long stride forward - both a natural evolution and a continuation of the electronic palette of Black Sands. With vocal features from Erykah Badu, as well as Grey Reverend (The Cinematic Orchestra) and Cornelia (Portico Quartet) it's another finely balanced body of work.

Bonobo has a long history of unearthing new talent (Andreya Triana, Bajka) and The North Borders saw him do so once again. The vocals of new collaborator Szjerdene are sprinkled across the album.

Since the album’s release, Green has gone on to play over 175 shows across three continents and 30 countries, wowing audiences with the hypnotic, extended live versions of his songs. He performed sold out shows at The Sydney Opera House and Brixton Academy, and his very own, day long festival at London’s Roundhouse. 2014 saw him and his band play the iconic Coachella, Sonar, Glastonbury and many more. This period of extensive touring came to a breathtaking close with his largest show to date at London’s Alexandra Palace in November. In celebration, Ninja Tune released The North Borders Tour. — Live. in October. A deluxe release including a live album, hardback book and a DVD of seminal live performances from a truly memorable tour.

In January 2016, Bonobo announced on Twitter that he intended to release a new album sometime in 2016. Bonobo released his sixth album, Migration, on 13 January 2017 via Ninja Tune. It was announced on 3 November 2016 with the release of the single ""Kerala"", and an official video. The album features Nick Murphy (fka Chet Faker), Rhye, Innov Gnawa and Nicole Miglis (Hundred Waters).

218,218,local natives,1318584,34901929,"Local Natives (formerly cavil at rest) is an indie rock band based in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, CA, United States.
After the three founding members originally met in high school, a bassist and a drummer were found, and they all moved to a house in Silver Lake in 2008 to record their album. Their debut album as Local Natives, ""Gorilla Manor"", was released in the UK on November 2nd, 2009, and saw a US release date of February 16th, 2010. The band's sound has been described as ""afropop-influenced guitars with hyperactive drumming and hooky three-part harmonies"". They started to attract the attention of the music press after playing nine shows at the 2009 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Initial reviews of Local Natives have drawn favourable comparisons to Arcade Fire, Fleet Foxes and Vampire Weekend.

Utilizing lots of vocal harmonies and drifting, dreamlike melodies, Local Natives have an intricate sound based around the delicate interconnectedness of all of their parts. This gives the band a sound that is able to be orchestral while still feeling understated, evoking the carefully assembled pop of Grizzly Bear. Their debut, Gorilla Manor, arrived in 2009 through U.K. label Infectious Records (with a domestic release coming by way of Frenchkiss in 2010). In 2011, Andy Hamm left Local Natives, leaving them to continue on as a quartet. In 2013, the band returned with its sophomore album, Hummingbird, featuring the single ""Breakers"".

220,220,baianasystem,134342,5683886,"BaianaSystem is a musical project aimed at spreading and exploring new possibilities through the sounds of Guitarra Baiana. This singular electric guitar - created in Bahia in the forties - was responsible for the creation of Trio Eletrico (a big moving sound system). It was also responsible for an instrumental language of the electric guitar which you will find in the interpretation of frevos, choros and several other musical styles that got new shape from the richness of the sound of this instrument.

It was from the need to expand this fullness of sound - while attempting to incorporate it into other musical genres thereby opening up a range of influences and offering the public a new dialogue with this instrument - that the Baiana System project emerged, where the Guitarra Baiana is the starting point. Idealised by Robertinho Barreto, guitar player of the group “Lampironicos”, who has been playing it for some time in the group and in many others musical projects, the BaianaSystem does not have a defined format but can assume many different arrangements. The underlying idea is the presence of a Live P.A. whereby the D.J. interacts with the Guitarra Baiana to produce a new musical arrangement. The DJ will work with the sampler and/or played bases, fitting in sounds and effects with freedom for improvisation. It uses resources such as layers, effects and loops, in a conception inspired by the freedom and psicodely of Dub.

The purpose of the project is to think about the channel of promotion and consolidation for the Guitarra Baiana (the trio eletrico);to perceive it as a special kind of Sound System (publisher of Dub) and to develop new ways of applying and relating to it. It also offers the opportunity to explore new possibilities of sounds with the Guitarra Baiana as well as investigating the interaction with the production of a rhythmic base.
The ‘mixing’ of language and philosophy and the creation of a new musical arrangement through developing an already existing one are the challenges of the Baiana System. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/BaianaSystem"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In one of his very few interviews, granted via email to the music magazine Rolling Stone, he only stated that he was born in Naples and goes by the name Liberato, although none of this information has ever been confirmed by authoritative third-party sources or official documentation.

The mystery surrounding his true identity is a distinctive trait of Liberato's persona, to the extent that he only appears in public while hooded, accompanied by look-alikes, or hidden behind a screen.

229,229,lil dicky,591850,7763361,"Lil Dicky (or LD) (born David Andrew Burd on 15 March 1988) is an American rapper and comedian. He came to prominence with the release of the music video of his song ""Ex-Boyfriend"", which went viral with more than one million views on YouTube in 24 hours. He released his debut album Professional Rapper on July 31, 2015. In 2018, his song ""Freaky Friday"", featuring Chris Brown, became a worldwide hit.

In an era where rap is dominated by racial, social, and economic minorities, LD decided to put the upper-middle class on his frail, Jewish shoulders. The results have been monumental. His debut mixtape, So Hard, has been categorized as “funny,” and “impressive” by his friends.

On 31st July 2015, Mr. Leftward-Sloping Penis released PROFESSIONAL RAPPER, featuring Snoop Dogg, Fetty Wap, Rich Homie Quan, T-Pain, Jace of Two-9 & brain. 

A non-traditional rapper, Lil Dicky uses a mix of comedy, lyrical ingenuity, and self-deprecation to spew out entertaining and relatable content.

When he was 14, he opened up for the R&B group 112 at his overnight camp. He’s been rapping ever since. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Dicky"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
230,230,balthazar,330592,9884362,"With hints of neo-psychedelia, electro-pop, and garage punk in their catchy, snarling alternative rock, Belgian group Balthazar formed in Kortrijk in 2004. Their second album, Rats, went all the way to number one in Belgium in 2012.

After starting Balthazar as teenagers, the lineup of Maarten Devoldere (lead vocals/guitar/keyboards), Jinte Deprez (guitar/vocals), and Patricia Vanneste (violin/keyboards/vocals) won a national youth talent competition in 2005 with the song ""Lost and Found."" They included the track on their self-titled debut EP, released in 2006. By then, they had begun touring with additional members Joachim Quartier (bass) and Koen Verfaillie (drums). In early 2007, the rhythm section was replaced by Simon Casier and Christophe Claeys. The following year, the band played their first shows outside of Belgium, visiting nearby countries including France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, and in 2009, they did a club tour of South Africa before returning to the studio.

Their first full-length record, Applause, arrived in March 2010 and spent a week at number 13 on Belgium's album chart. They followed it up with appearances at European summer festivals such as Pukkelpop and Rock Werchter as well as tours in support of the Joy Formidable and dEUS. With mixing by Noah Georgeson (the Strokes, Joanna Newsom), the band's second studio LP, Rats, was released by Play It Again Sam in 2012. It topped the album chart in Belgium, also charting in France and the Netherlands. Featuring the line-up of Devoldere, Deprez, Vanneste, Casier, and drummer Michiel Balcaen, their third long-player, 2015's Thin Walls, was their first with an outside producer, Ben Hillier (Depeche Mode, Blur). It reached the number two spot in their home country and the Top 20 in the Netherlands.

After 14 years in the group, Vanneste parted ways with Balthazar in April 2018. The rest of the members returned with their PIAS-issued fourth album Fever in early 2019. The title track became their first single to chart in Belgium when it debuted at number 47. This was succeeded by 2021 LP Sand: preoccupied with themes of restlessness and waiting, the group's fifth album featured a cover designed by sculptor Margriet Van Breevort.

Tim Halperin enrolled in piano lessons at age six and spent his adolescent years writing music and performing with various bands including a worship team at his church.

In January 2008, Tim released his debut single, You Are the Moon. His music was featured on several XM radio stations, and he made a guest appearance on NBC’s Kansas City Live. Tim’s fans encouraged him with overwhelming support, prompting his concert tour through the Midwest.

In the early months of 2011, Tim found a new fanbase with his successful run on 'American Idol', getting to the live portion of the show and the Top 24 with stand-out performances at the piano.  With solid roots, a genuine love for music, and proven ability, Halperin will continue to make his mark on the music industry.

234,234,slow pulp,675184,16427333,"The dreamy songs of Midwest indie rock outfit Slow Pulp draw on moody shoegaze, hooky grunge, and intimate lo-fi fare. The band made their full-length debut with Moveys in 2020.
Guitarist Henry Stoehr, bass player Alexander Leeds, and drummer Theodore Mathews started making music together as friends in the sixth grade, naming their first band from letters in their first names. It wasn't until high school, when Emily Massey contributed guitar and backing vocals to later incarnation Slow Pulp's second EP, 2017's EP2, that an improved vision of the band clicked. They soon made Massey lead singer and took down a debut EP that didn't involve her.

Now a four-piece, the group worked up the stand-alone tracks ""At Home"" and ""Steel Birds,"" which they self-released in 2018 while relocating to Chicago. Written and mostly recorded in a cabin in Michigan in January 2019, the Big Day EP followed in May 2019. Slow Pulp headed out on tour with Alex G later in the year, as they worked on their full-length debut. The project was not without obstacles; material was scrapped, and Massey struggled with her own health problems before returning to Madison to help her parents recover from a car accident. The COVID-19 pandemic soon limited travel. With Stoehr acting as main engineer, producer, and mixer, they were able to complete the album long-distance.

240,240,femi,14855,91346,"Rising from Oakland's vibrant underground, FEMI celebrates a trio of life forces on her debut EP, ""Sweet Water Soul."" It has love, the gift of prayer, and is fluid like water, which is the underlying theme of the EP. In tandem with FEMI's jazzy vocals, sensual lyrics, and gracious intent, the result is an unrivaled suite of original songs equally danceable and reverent.

For the past 5 years, FEMI helped pioneer a visionary music community in her native Bay Area. She is often categorized as a neo-SOUL soulstress and compared with artists such as Sade, Prince and Minnie Ripperton. Yet her experimental fusion transcends easy genres. ""Sweet Water Soul"" incorporates heavy doses of jazz, soul, hip-hop, and Caribbean influences, a melodic hybrid of the pulses of Oakland, New York, and Latin America. In the same vein, FEMI is called beyond ""just"" being a singer and performer; She wrote, composed, and arranged all of the material on the record, and was heavily involved in the studio recording process with pc muñoz, a San Francisco-based producer with Talking House Records esteemed for challenging musical boundaries.

Sweet Water Soul's introductory track, ""Sweet Water (Rezo)"" -- rezo meaning prayer -- gives thanks to the love and protection of God and to FEMI's favorite orisha, Oshun, a river deity symbolizing prosperity and sensuality. ""Oshun energy is always present in my life,"" she says. This song is the first instance of the breathy, jazzy flute that is a main instrument in most of the tracks, lending the album an airy yet grounded quality. ""Imported"" is a spicy rhythm, inspired by her first trip to Puerto Rico (a trip she took to learn more about her Afro-carribean roots) and the grandeur of a love surpassing time and space. Riding on the sweet staccato of Spanish-style guitar, FEMI's sultry, layered vocals conjure the warm Caribbean twilight. ""If I knew anything about love, could it be with you?"" she asks on the teasing ""Crush."" This song is exemplary of FEMI's ability to weave the story and the music, with a sexy groove and delicate chimes supporting a lyrical quest for vulnerability and reciprocity.

Given the progression of romance, could this track be followed by any other than ""If I Knew"" A song reliant on reggae-influenced rhythm and driven by a tight horn section (ala Earth, Wind & Fire), it tells of surrendering to the love that was so desired. ""I Want You"" is essentially its cool, sweet sequel: ""This song is like a letter to my lover,"" FEMI says. ""You realize that there is something in them that lets you know it's okay to allow love in again."" ""Pages"" brings the album full circle, coasting on an easy rhythm to back Femi's reflections on writing, emotional freedom, and self-reliance. The track and album, gracefully ends with piano, chimes, and chirping birds. Like its pure namesake, ""Sweet Water Soul"" will quench thirsty spirits over and over again. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Femi"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1) London-based songwriter and electronic musician William Phillips makes yearning, bittersweet dance tracks under the name Tourist.

Phillips initially made a splash in 2010, when he was using the moniker Little Loud; his remixes of indie artists such as Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti and HEALTH circulated online and received notice from music websites such as Pitchfork. He debuted the Tourist pseudonym in 2012 with a self-titled EP (also referred to as Placid Acid) on Make Mine, which also released an early single by Disclosure around the same time. The EP's sunny, '80s-inspired synthesizer melodies and leisurely tempos were in line with the chillwave subgenre, but Tourist's subsequent work took a darker, more poignant turn.

The Tonight EP appeared in 2013 on the Monday label, and the release marked the shift in Tourist's sound toward U.K. garage and house, with choppy vocal samples and more urgent melodies. He completed high-profile remixes for Chvrches and Haim, and his EP Patterns arrived on Disclosure's Method Records in 2014. Featuring guest appearances by Lianne La Havas and Will Heard as well as the single ""Together,"" the EP was Phillips' most well-received release yet. He also co-wrote Sam Smith's smash hit ""Stay with Me,"" which won the 2015 Grammy Award for Song of the Year. Phillips continued to release Tourist singles and collaborated with Years & Years and Josef Salvat & Niia in addition to co-writing Låpsley's single ""Hurt Me.""

Tourist's debut album, U, inspired by the end of a four-year relationship, arrived on Monday in 2016. Phillips returned in the summer of 2017 with the Tourist and Ardyn collaborative single ""We Stayed Up All Night."" Three more singles arrived in 2018 with ""Hearts,"" ""Apollo,"" and ""Someone Else."" Two Tourist full-lengths appeared in 2019: Everyday and Wild.

243,243,donovan woods,179696,1600904,"Donovan Woods’ latest album is an acoustic reimagining of songs we already know, and yet it reveals new shades of his acclaimed songwriting and spectral singing that leaves his listeners hanging on every word.

Released on May 3 on Woods’ Meant Well label, The Other Way mines fresh meaning from the songs first collected on Both Ways, the Canadian artist’s 2018 release that scored him his first Juno Award (contemporary roots album) and a Canadian Country Music Award (roots album). Often hailed as a songwriter’s songwriter, Woods had been nominated for a Juno a handful of times in previous years, including two nods for songwriter of the year.

The Other Way brims with luminous renditions that are stark yet startling in their urgency. As the year winds down, though, Woods’ newest songs are adding even more color to his palette. Pulsing with an electro-acoustic heartbeat, “Way Way Back” pays homage to the long shadow that old lovers often cast and the ways they creep back into our memories.

Released on December 6, “While All the While,” co-written with ace singer-songwriter Lori McKenna, is essentially Woods’ songwriting in miniature, a portrait of quotidian life that swells into a poignant meditation on how we sit with and reconcile our conflicted feelings.

“Therapy helped guide me into the idea that it’s OK to be sad. I can be sad and still make jokes and laugh. I can be sad and sing. I can be sad while still being grateful and happy that people come see my shows and care about the songs I make,” Woods says.

“I brought this idea to Lori, and we tried to write a song about just that. Getting up and going on with life,” he adds. “A little celebration of the things we do while all the while a little sadness is still there with us.”

Perhaps without even knowing it, Woods has explored that feeling with quiet grace throughout his celebrated career, starting with his 2009 debut, The Hold Up. A decade later, he has become an in-demand songwriter whose work has been recorded by Tim McGraw (“Portland, Maine”), Lady Antebellum’s Charles Kelley (“Leaving Nashville”) and Billy Currington (“Sweet Love”), with over 200 million streams.

His secret? Fans don't just hear Woods' words – they connect with them as if his songs are telling the stories of their own lives. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Donovan+Woods"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

245,245,provinz,67967,3305237,"Provinz ist eine deutsche Indie-Pop-Band aus dem oberschwäbischen Vogt, die 2012 gegründet wurde. 

Die beiden Cousins Vincent Waizenegger und Robin Schmid aus der baden-württembergischen Gemeinde Vogt im Landkreis Ravensburg machten unter dem Namen Twice schon länger gemeinsam Musik. 2012 kam der dritte Cousin Moritz Bösing dazu und der Name wurde in Provinz geändert. Der Schlagzeuger Leon Sennewald, mit dem Waizenegger gemeinsam 2018 in Ravensburg sein Abitur ablegte, stieß 2017 dazu. Die Band nahm am Förderwettbewerb Bandpool Mannheimer Popakademie teil und kam darüber in Kontakt mit Plattenfirmen.

Provinz unterschrieb daraufhin 2019 einen Plattenvertrag beim Major-Label Warner Music. Im März 2019 erschien die erste Single Neonlicht. Am 3. Mai 2019 wurde die erste Reicht dir das veröffentlicht, die neben dem gleichnamigen Titelsong die drei weiteren Stücke Neonlicht, Was uns high macht und Zu jung beinhaltete. Aufgenommen wurde die EP in den Hansa Studios in Berlin von Produzent Tim Tautorat, der unter anderem auch AnnenMayKantereit und Faber produzierte. Es folgten Auftritte bei größeren Festivals wie dem KOSMOS in Chemnitz und dem Reeperbahnfestival sowie ein Fernsehauftritt bei Inas Nacht.

Das Debütalbum Wir bauten uns Amerika – zunächst angekündigt für den 17. April 2020, dann verschoben auf den 14. August, wurde schließlich am 17. Juli 2020 veröffentlicht. Als erste Vorab-Single erschien im Oktober 2019 der Song Augen sind rot, mit dem Provinz unter anderem in der Fernsehsendung Late Night Berlin auf ProSieben auftraten. Zwei Touren im Frühjahr und Herbst mussten 2020 genauso wie einige größere Festival-Auftritte aufgrund der Covid-19-Pandemie abgesagt werden. Dennoch erreichte das Album Platz 4 in den deutschen Album-Charts. Die Band gewann 2020 die 1 Live Krone als bester Newcomer.

Im Sommer 2021 veröffentlichten Provinz die EP Zu spät um umzudrehen mit fünf neuen Songs, für die sie unter anderem erneut mit Tautorat aber auch mit dem Musiker und Produzenten Fayzen zusammen arbeiteten, darunter die auch als Single ausgekoppelten Hymne gegen euch und Großstadt. Kurz darauf erschien zudem der Song Liebe zu dritt gemeinsam mit Majan und Jeremias, mit dem sie erstmals die Singlecharts erreichten. Ende 2021 fand dann die verschobene Wir bauten euch Amerika-Tour statt. 2021 gewannen Provinz die 1 Live Krone als beste Band und waren nominiert als Best German Act bei den MTV Europe Music Awards. Im Frühjahr 2022 ist eine weitere Tour geplant.

Am 16. September 2022 erschien das zweite Album namens Zorn & Liebe. Die gleichnamige Vorab-Single mit der Sängerin Nina Chuba erschien bereits im Februar 2022 und erreichte ebenfalls die Singlecharts.

246,246,the head and the heart,1082982,21754784,"The Head and the Heart is an American indie-folk band which formed in 2009 in Seattle, Washington, United States. The band consists of Josiah Johnson (vocals, guitar), Jonathan Russell (vocals, guitar), Charity Rose Thielen (violin, vocals), Chris Zasche (bass), Kenny Hensley (keyboards) and Tyler Williams (drums).

Composed primarily of transplants to the Seattle area, The Head and the Heart write and play songs that speak to the newness of a fresh start, of the ghosts left behind, of moving forward, all brimming with a soulfulness and hope for a better life than the one we've all been sold.

Stylistically, think a folksy Beatles or The Avett Brothers with a little extra oomph. Catchy piano melodies stand side by side with a tight trio of harmonies, and solid minimalist drums, groovin' bass, and plenty of hand percussion and foot stomps make the live show inspiring and really goddamn fun.

After the band self-released its eponymous debut album in June 2010, the emblematic Seattle label Sub Pop re-released the album. For the Sub Pop version, the song “Sounds like Hallelujah” has been re-recorded, live favorite “Rivers and Roads” has been added, and the album has been re-mastered. 

The band's second album ""Let's Be Still"" was released on October 15, 2013. 

The band released their third studio album, ""Signs of Light"", in September 2016.

They are known for their unique lo-fi sound, recording their music onto cassette decks and similar equipment at their home studio nicknamed Low Earth Orbit.

The duo released two demo tapes in the same year as their formation, Christmas Dust and On The Dodge. In 1997, they released their debut 7"" EP Transmission, Flux via Up Records. The band briefly recorded under the moniker Valium Aggelein, releasing Dweller on the Threshold as a cassette tape that same year, alongside Hier kommt der schwartze Mond in 1998.

Jason Albertini joined the band during the recording of their debut album Stratosphere, playing drums on three tracks. The album was released by Up Records in February  1998, being followed by the Apex, Trance-Like 7"" EP via Smooth Lips Records that same year. By the release of the 1975 EP in 1999 and their second studio album Contemporary Movement, Albertini had become more involved in the group's creative process and became a permament member of the band. 

By 2000, Duster had become inactive and went on hiatus. In an interview, Clay Parton stated that ""When we originally paused around 2000, it was because of me. I went through a breakup, and I had a new baby, so I had to figure out to provide for this tiny person. A band was just not a priority anymore. So the other guys moved to Seattle, everyone was just kind of their own satellite for a while."" Duster had reconvened in 2004, expanding their lineup to include guitarist Krag and bassist Ross Peard. They announced that they had began working on new material, but were ultimately unsatisfied with the results and left it unfinished. The band had dissolved by 2005.

After Duster's dissolution, Albertini and Amber went on to form the experimental band Helvetia in 2005. Parton released his debut album Birds in the Ground under his solo alias Eiafuawn (short for ""Everything Is All Fucked Up And What Not"") the same year. Amber also released the self-titled EP Canaan Amber in 2010.

Duster announced their return on Instagram in 2018 with the simple message ""hi. it's been a long time but we are recording a little bit."" In January 2019, Numero Group announced Capsule Losing Contact, a boxset reissue of their complete discography, alongside unreleased material. The boxset was released in March. The band's first studio album in 19 years, the self-titled Duster, was released in December 2019 via Muddguts Records. 

In April 2022, the band surprise-released Together, their fourth studio album. Clay Parton announced via his forum Stereobird that ""jason is not a part of duster anymore and he's not on this record and no one should be reading anything at all into that because we all love each other still and forever..."", asking fans to also support Helvetia's recent output.

In 2023, Numero Group released Remote Echoes, an archival release compiling the band's widely-bootlegged demo material. The band's fifth studio album, In Dreams, was similarly surprise-dropped in August 2024. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Duster"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

6,6,taylor swift,5039406,2863880718,"Taylor Alison Swift is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise.

Swift rose to mainstream prominence with her sophomore studio album, Fearless (2008), a country pop record with crossover appeal. Aided by the top-five singles “Love Story” and “You Belong with Me”, Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Swift's third studio album, Speak Now (2010), blended country pop with elements of rock and featured the top-ten singles “Mine” and “Back to December”.

Drawing inspiration from various pop, rock, and electronic genres, Swift's fourth studio album Red (2012) saw her transcending her country roots. She completely moved to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), and expanded the electropop sound on her next two studio albums, reputation (2017) and Lover (2019), which respectively embraced urban and retro styles. The four albums spawned a string of international top-five singles, including “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”, “I Knew You Were Trouble”, “Shake It Off”, “Blank Space”, “Bad Blood”, “Look What You Made Me Do”, “ME! (feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco)”, “You Need to Calm Down”, and “Lover”.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift experimented with folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums, folklore and evermore (both 2020), whose lead singles “cardigan” and “willow” topped charts around the world. She also released the critically acclaimed documentaries Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions that year. Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights (2022), marked her triumphant return to pop after two folk albums. The album set the record for biggest first day and first week ever on Spotify, spawned the hits Anti-Hero and Lavender Haze, and sold over 1.5 million copies in its first week becoming not only the biggest debut of the decade but also Swift's biggest debut ever. She would make history by becoming the first artist to occupy the entire top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 with tracks from Midnights.

Additionally, Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020 as a result of a publicized dispute with talent manager Scooter Braun and her former label Big Machine, regarding the acquisition of the masters of her back catalog. In April 2021, Swift released a re-recorded issue of her 2008 album Fearless, titled Fearless (Taylor's Version). It debuted at number one in the US. Swift continued releasing re-recorded versions of her back catalog in November, 2021 with the release of Red (Taylor's Version), a 30 track re-issue of her 2012 critical smash. The album debuted at #1 in the US, spawned the #1 hit All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From the Vault), and broke the record at the time for biggest first day for a female album on Spotify. Red (Taylor's Version) was a critical and commercial hit, and proved that Swift's ambitious, yet ongoing plan to re-record her first 6 albums was well worth it.

Along with the release of Red (Taylor's Version) came All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), Swift's filmmaking debut. The 15 minute romantic drama was based on the lyrical content from Swift's 2012 fan favorite “All Too Well” starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien. It had a limited theatrical release in major cities, and Swift held special screenings of the film throughout 2022 at various film festivals. In December, 2022 Taylor announced that she would be making her feature directorial debut with Oscar-winning studio Searchlight Pictures.

Following the release of Midnights, Swift would embark on her first tour in five years, The Eras Tour—a retrospective tour covering the entirety of her discography. During her ongoing tour, Swift would release her next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) in July and 1989 (Taylor's Version) in October of 2023. The former of which would land Swift as the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand. The latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, her largest album sales in a week span. “Is It Over Now? (Taylor's Version)”, the lead single for 1989 (Taylor's Version), would peak at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.

At the 66th annual GRAMMY Awards, Taylor Swift surprised viewers by announcing her eleventh studio album, THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT. On April 19, 2024, the album was released globally, breaking records: it became the first ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week and sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US. Swift dominated the charts, monopolizing the top 14 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 and securing the top 10 positions on Australia’s ARIA Singles Chart. The lead single, Fortnight, featuring Post Malone, quickly soared to the number-one position on the Hot 100. Additionally, just two hours after the album’s release, Swift surprised fans with a reissue titled THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY, which included 15 extra songs.

Swift has released several songs for film soundtracks. She co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack— “You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home” and “Crazier”, and contributed two songs to the Valentine's Day soundtrack, including the single “Today Was a Fairytale”, which was her first number one on the Canadian Hot 100, and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. She also contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: “Safe & Sound - from The Hunger Games Soundtrack”, co-written and recorded with The Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, and “Eyes Open”. “Safe & Sound” won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In 2013, Swift recorded “Sweeter than Fiction”, a song she wrote and produced with Jack Antonoff for the One Chance film soundtrack, which received a Best Original Song nomination at the 71st Golden Globe Awards. Swift and English singer Zayn Malik, mononymously known as Zayn, released a single together, “I Don't Wanna Live Forever”, for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). She also recorded an original song called “Beautiful Ghosts”, which she wrote with Andrew Lloyd Webber for the Cats's soundtrack (2019). In 2020, Swift's documentary Miss Americana featured the song “Only the Young” which was written after the 2018 United States elections. In 2022, she released an original song titled “Carolina” for Where The Crawdads Sing (2022) inspired by the novel written by Delia Owens.

With sales of over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is a best-selling music artist. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, including four Album of the Year wins, which makes Swift the artist with the most awards for that category in history, two Brit Awards (including a Global Icon award), an Emmy Award, 28 Guinness World Records, 32 American Music Awards (the most wins by an artist), and 23 Billboard Music Awards (the most wins by a woman). She ranked eighth on Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists Chart (2019) and was listed on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015). Swift has been included in various power rankings, such as Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2010, 2015 and 2019) and Forbes Celebrity 100 (placing first in 2016 and 2019). She was named Woman of the Decade (2010s) by Billboard, Artist of the Decade (2010s) by the American Music Awards, and Person of the Year (2023) by Time Magazine. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

9,9,mau y ricky,164705,2212520,"For the past few years, Mauricio and Ricky Montaner had been busy writing songs for other artists like Thalía, Miguel Bosé, Diego Boneta, Yuridia, Leslie Grace, to name a few, until recently when they decided the songs they were composing would be for their EP titled Arte under the label of Sony Music.

The young duo, Mau y Ricky, sons of music icon Ricardo Montaner, have released the album's first single, ""Voy Que Quemo,"" a song they decided best represents the music that is coming out in the LP, expected to release in July. ""After writing so many songs, it just seemed natural to start recording an album,"" Ricky, 25, tells Billboard, speaking on behalf of the duo since Mau was on vocal rest. ""We have 10 songs and an 11th that is an instrumental track. 'Voy Que Quemo' seemed like the best song to release first, and we're feeling super excited and nervous.""

Mau y Ricky partnered with Latin Grammy winner Julio Reyes Copello to produce their album and credit him for allowing them to grow artistically and teach them about following their intuition. ""We've grown as producers and songwriters, thanks to him. We also learned that the intuition of an artist is so important and it's something that needs to be respected because your intuition will differentiate you from others. We learned to write for ourselves and put out songs that will represent who we are.""

And that's exactly what Mau y Ricky did. They followed their intuition after listening to their song ""Arte"" which was almost going to be pitched to Wisin, but Ricky says, ""It didn't feel right for another artist to sing this song."" Another man they have to thank for guiding them since they started composing at a very young age is their father, who has written hit singles like ""La Cima del Cielo,"" ""Déjame Llorar"" and ""Me Va a Extrañar.""

""We've written songs together, so working with him helps you grow a lot because he's a very hard critic. Every song I've written since I was 8 years old, I'd run it by him and he'd give me feedback. He actually just heard the final product of our album and he loved it, thank God. But the best thing is that he's a fan of ours and we're huge fans of him. Yeah, he's my dad, but I'm a huge Ricardo Montaner fan.""

Besides a new album, Mau y Ricky fans can expect to see them onstage soon as they go out on tour. ""We haven't toured in such a long time because we were busy writing for others then started working on this album, but the stage is our natural habitat and where we feel most comfortable."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mau+y+Ricky"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He began as a Latin pop artist and has recorded many ballads, but has released several successful reggaeton singles. Yatra is noted for his romantic lyrics, melding traditional lyricism with modern reggaeton influences. He rose to prominence in Latin America in 2016 when he released the hit ""Traicionera"". He has released three studio albums and recorded with artists from a diverse range of musical genres throughout his career.

Born in Medellín and raised primarily in Miami, Yatra began singing at a young age and returned to Colombia to begin his musical career. He achieved breakout success with ""Traicionera"" followed by ""Robarte un Beso"" featuring Carlos Vives. ""Traicionera"" served as the lead single for his 2018 debut album, Mantra, which also featured the single ""Sutra"", featuring Puerto Rican rapper Dalmata. He then released the album Fantasia including the lead single ""Un Año"" featuring Mexican band Reik. He received continued success collaborating with Daddy Yankee, Natti Natasha, and the Jonas Brothers on the bilingual single ""Runaway"".

Yatra's music has been classified as Latin pop, reggaeton, and ballads. According to The Fader, Yatras music lands ""somewhere in between the olden times’ sappy romantics and the new wave’s sensuous vibras.""He is influenced by Latin pop and reggaeton artists Ricky Martin, J Balvin, Juanes, and Reik. In an interview with Billboard, he expressed a desire to collaborate with Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli. Yatra believes that contemporary musicians commit an ""error in associating ballads with boring and slow and old"", and hopes to rejuvenate intererest in ballads for a younger audience.However, his music contains elements of other genres; Desire Thompson of Vibe described his song ""Traicionera"" as a ""trap-EDM blend"".

Despite growing up in Florida and being fluent in English, Yatra sings almost exclusively in Spanish. Yatra explains, “My goal was always to be a singer in Spanish. And I really wanted to understand where I come from and live it. A lot of times I went to Colombia and, even though I spoke Spanish and was always speaking Spanish with my parents, I still felt like an outsider. I wasn’t 100 percent part of it. I wanted to give my roots the importance they deserve. ”His June 2019 song ""Runaway"" was his first foray into bilingual songwriting. In December 2019, he collaborated with South Korean boy group Monsta X for the song ""Magnetic"", which features verses from Yatra in Spanish and a bridge from Monsta X in Spanglish.

17,17,harry styles,2677849,330832344,"Harry Edward Styles (born 1 February 1994 in Redditch, Worcestershire, England) is a three-time GRAMMY award-winning, British singer, songwriter, and actor. As a member of the British/Irish boy band One Direction, singer Harry Styles topped the charts, toured the world, and sold millions of albums before going solo in 2016. Styles was raised in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, and he made his first foray into music with a high-school band named White Eskimo. In 2010, he left home and joined the seventh season of The X Factor, where fate and Simon Cowell would eventually lead him toward a life-changing opportunity with four other young men. As One Direction, Styles and his group mates Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, and Liam Payne would release five albums from 2011 to 2015, hitting number one across the globe and selling millions of records to an adoring and rabid fan base that drew comparisons to the fervor at the height of Beatlemania. In early 2016, after Malik had already parted ways with 1D, the remaining foursome announced their indefinite hiatus.

Months later, Styles signed a solo deal with Columbia Records. Reflecting the influence of childhood favorites like Queen, Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, The Rolling Stones, Freddy Mercury, and The Beatles, Styles' solo material took a more serious and rock-based approach, while still delivering the pop sound his faithful 1D fans desired. With the help of Grammy-winning producer Jeff Bhasker (who had worked with Kanye West and Bruno Mars), Styles put together a small band and, after rehearsing the songs, headed to Jamaica for two months to record an album. ""Sign of the Times"", a plaintive ballad, was released as its first single in April 2017. The self-titled full-length album Harry Styles followed in May and debuted at the top of the Billboard 200. After two world tours, Harry set to write his sophomore album Fine Line, releasing the hit songs ""Lights Up"",  ""Watermelon Sugar"" and ""Adore You"" as the singles.

Fine Line was released on 13 December 2019 by Columbia and Erskine Records. On March 14, 2021, Harry received the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance for ""Watermelon Sugar"" at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. He was also nominated for Best Music Video with ""Adore You"" and for Best Pop Vocal Album for his ""Fine Line"" album. In May of the same year, Styles also won the Brit Award for British Single for ""Watermelon Sugar"". 

On May 20, 2022, Styles released his third studio album, titled  Harry’s House. Its promotional single ""As It Was"" went on to break world records and earn Styles the title (male) for the most-streamed track on Spotify in 24 hours. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Styles"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

18,18,luis fonsi,1130613,12634735,"Luis Alfonso Rodríguez López-Cepero, more commonly known as Luis Fonsi, (born April 15, 1978 in San Juan, Puerto Rico) is a Latin Grammy winning Puerto Rican singer, composer and soap opera actor.

Fonsi and his family moved to Orlando, Florida, during Fonsi's early childhood. Fonsi's childhood was relatively average for kids his age, beginning to dream about becoming a member of Menudo, arguably Latin America's most famous boy band in history, around the time he was ten years old.

Because of the air distance between his home in Orlando and Menudo's base back in Puerto Rico in particular, Fonsi was not able to achieve that particular childhood dream. He did, however, participate in many local boy bands, including one, Big Guys, where he met, and befriended, future *NSYNC member Joey Fatone. On April of that year, Fonsi had a brief return to the singing stage, when former Menudo Ray Reyes invited him and Lopez to a concert which was held at San Juan's Roberto Clemente coliseum. The press widely covered what El Vocero titled as Fonsi's moment as a Menudo, when he took the stage and joined the members of El Reencuentro to sing some of their old hits.

Fonsi's popularity has transcended ages and genres in Puerto Rico: industrialist Salvador Vassallo, for example, has told El Vocero that Fonsi is among his favorite singers.

Instead of choosing to keep a pattern of trying to find stardom in the United States with a boy band, Fonsi chose to better prepare himself for a future, stable career inside show business. He went to Florida State University to study vocal techniques. Meanwhile, he began to record demo tapes in Miami. While he was at FSU, he was overheard singing by a university music department president, who offered him a contract with a large recording company.

In 1999, Fonsi recorded his first CD, Comenzare (I Will Begin). Comenzare became an instant hit in Puerto Rico and across Latin America, with Fonsi conquering such markets as Colombia, the Dominican Republic,El Salvador, Mexico and Venezuela. His 2000 follow-up, Eterno, was equally successful. By then, Fonsi's fame had reached Europe, as he became a celebrity in Spain as well.

During 2001, a re-mix of Comenzare and Eterno was launched, while Fonsi worked on his next album, 2002's Amor Secreto. At about the same time, some media outlets such as newspapers and magazines began to comment about an allegued, adulterous romance between him and an also very famous married Puerto Rican singer, who had just happened to separate from her husband recently and bought a home near Fonsi's Orlando property. The scandal did not last too long, however, and Fonsi soon released an album in English, Fight the Feeling, also released in 2002.

Fight the Feeling did not sell well among Americans. It is expected, however, that Fonsi will sometime in the future make a second attempt at a crossover: because of the fact he has lived most of his life in Orlando, he is fluent in English as well as in Spanish.

His Fourth CD sold very well which opened new markets in Europe. ""Quien te Dijo eso?"" reached high positions on music charts. His fifth CD ""Paso a Paso"" could be said to be his disc that launched him into international markets. ""Nada es Para Siempre"" reached Number one on the music chart beating famous, Shakira.

By 2003, Fonsi began to fall in love with actress Adamari Lopez, who, as an Univision artist and fellow Puerto Rican, constantly found herself near Fonsi. That same year, Fonsi released the song Abrazar la Vida (Holding on to Life), of the album also named Abrazar la Vida. The song, perhaps ironically and because of a particular circumstance, would later become one of Lopez's favorite songs. While Fight the Feeling was released by the MCA label, Abrazar la Vida was released by Universal's Spanish music label. Fonsi also recorded Amazing in 2003, a duet with Emma Bunton for her 2004 album Free Me.

Fonsi took off 2004, a year when rumors were reported by magazines, television news shows and newspapers that he and Lopez had committed to marry each other. During 2005, Fonsi was in the middle of an international tour that would have had him away from home for many months; the tour was abruptly cancelled when Lopez was diagnosed with cancer. Fonsi promised her to stay by her side, and has travelled with her back and forth between Mexico, Miami and Puerto Rico for various treatment and work related trips.

On June 3, 2006, Fonsi and Adamari Lopez were married in a religious ceremony in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico attended by many celebrities including Joey Fatone, Charytin, Ednita Nazario, and Carlos Ponce and his brother, aspiring Spanish-language singer Jean Rodriguez, who goes simply by Jean as his professional name. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Luis+Fonsi"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Austin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York. He was raised by his father, Richard Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip-hop, country, and rock. When Malone was nine years old, he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys. Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game Guitar Hero.

Malone has always had a love for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event. According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band. He says soon afterward he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip-hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.

According to Malone, he chose ""Post Malone"" as his stage name when he was 14 or 15. The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone, but Malone later explained that ""Post"" is his last name, and he used a ""rap name generator"" to get ""Malone"". At 16, using the audio editor Audacity, Malone created his first mixtape, Young and After Them Riches. He showed it to some of his classmates at Grapevine High School. He was voted ""Most Likely to Become Famous"" by his classmates as a senior in high school. He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.

Malone later enrolled in Tarrant County College but dropped out. After leaving college, Malone moved to Los Angeles, California, with his longtime friend Jason Probst, a professional game streamer.

In August 2016, Malone issued an apology for his album, Stoney, being late. It was available for pre-order on November 4 and was finally released on December 9.

He is one of the most well known reggaeton artists in Latin America. His cross over success in the U.S. has given him more exposure to English speaking Reggaeton fans, making him one of the more recognizable faces of Reggaeton along with Daddy Yankee and Tego Calderón. Don Omar's popularity is currently rising and he recently appeared on MTV. Omar is best known for his songs ""Dile"" and ""Dale Don Dale"" from his first album The Last Don and ""Reggaeton Latino"".

25,25,natti natasha,306506,4359458,"Natalia Alexandra Gutiérrez, known by her stage name Natti Natasha, is a Dominican reggaeton singer, songwriter, and actress. Hailing from Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Natasha grew up surrounded by endless musical influences and enrolled in Santiago’s School of Fine Arts at the age of seven where she developed her singing abilities, describing her time at the school as “one of the best of her life.” Her studio experience would begin as a teenager when she would record songs as a hobby and later alongside friends.

This all led up to her decision to make the biggest and riskiest move of her life, and that was to move to the United States. She settled in the Bronx, New York, or “the City of the Dreams and Dreamers” for young, aspiring musicians like her at the time. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Natti called the move “one of the craziest moves anyone ever did in her family,” and that she often looks back at the decision and wonders what she was doing. Natti would hop from studio to studio, working without pay, but to her, this was a way to get her name out there. A producer friend from Santiago would soon step in and lend her his New York studio.

Natti’s first-ever break came when icon Don Omar signed her to his record label, the Orfanato Music Group, and the pair would go on to make history for years to come. Their collaborations “Dutty Love,” “Tus Movimientos,” “Perdido en tus Ojos,” and a “Hold Ya” remix with Gyptian made waves across Latin America and introduced the world to future reggaeton royalty. Her debut project, an EP titled “All About Me” was released on March 28, 2012.

Natti would continue to make big career moves throughout the years including her departure from Don Omar’s record label and signing onto Pina Records in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2017 when her big breakout would come once and for all. Not only did she record and release a collaboration titled “Otra Cosa” alongside the legendary Daddy Yankee, but she also released what was arguably the biggest song of 2017. “Criminal” featuring Ozuna became an instant hit upon its release, the music video amassing over 1 billion views in just five months and becoming the most watched music video by a female singer released that year.

2019 saw the release of her much-anticipated debut album, “ilumiNATTI,” on February 15. 15 tracks made up the project with two collaborations in total, “Te Lo Dije'' with Anitta and “Soy Mía” with Kany García. Standout track “La Mejor Version de Mi” would transform into a bachata hit with its remix featuring bachata king Romeo Santos.

Natti’s sophomore album titled “NATTIVIDAD” would be released two years later on September 24, 2021 with 17 tracks featuring several chart-topping collaborators such as Becky G, Maluma, and Prince Royce. The release was followed up by the six-episode docuseries titled “Everybody Loves Natti” which documented her pregnancy and relationship with fiancé Raphy Pina. The series premiered on November 19, 2021 on Amazon Prime Video and was generally well received. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Natti+Natasha"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

30,30,mark ronson,2648808,42218498,"Mark Ronson  (born 4 September 1975) is a sought-after producer, who's worked with such diverse artists as Miley Cyrus, Jay-Z, Lily Allen, Robbie Williams, Bruno Mars, Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Duran Duran and comedian Jimmy Fallon. 

Born in London, he is the son of writer Ann Dexter-Jones and real estate tycoon Laurence Ronson. His mother later married Mick Jones, lead guitarist of multiplatinum selling rock band Foreigner. He has two sisters: fashion designer Charlotte Ronson and DJ Samantha Ronson. He spent his childhood in a wealthy suburb of London where he lived on the same street as Paul McCartney‘s family. When his parents divorced at age 8, he moved to New York, where he made friends with John Lennon's son, Sean Lennon.

Ronson played guitar and drums from an early age, but it wasn't until moving to New York City with his mother that Ronson discovered DJ culture. At age 16, already a fan of such popular hip-hop artists as Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys, Ronson began listening to the various hip-hop mixtapes released every few months by DJs. Inspired, Ronson confiscated his father's record collection and began trying his hand at mixing. 

The young DJ with the diverse taste soon caught the ears and eyes of various socialites and New York celebrities, including fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger, who featured Ronson along with other sons and daughters of celebrities in a 1997 fashion campaign. A year later, hip-hop mogul Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs hired Ronson to DJ his fabled 29th birthday bash. These and other high-profile gigs boosted Ronson's ""hip quotient"" and helped promote his more serious-minded music career. Fusing his eclectic turntable skills with his knowledge of musical instruments and songwriting, Ronson eventually embarked on his first solo project. Featuring such diverse guest artists as dancehall rapper Sean Paul, hip-hop artist Mos Def, Jack White of the White Stripes, and Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, Ronson's debut album, Here Comes the Fuzz, bowed for Elektra in 2003.

Ronson's second album, Version, adds to his eclectic style. In this sophomore album, Ronson fuses a range of musical genres from Daniel Merriweather to Ol' Dirty Bastard to Phantom Planet with an up tempo contemporary funk sound. All the songs on this album are covers of previous Billboard top-10 pop songs, with a jazzy twist.

Career

Attending Vassar College and then New York University (NYU), Ronson became a regular at downtown hip-hop spots and made his name as a DJ on the New York club scene in 1993. He was soon one of the most respected DJs and was being called on for celebrities' private parties. Ronson is known for his diverse, genre-spanning selection, influenced by both the hip-hop scene of New York and the more rock influence of the UK, amongst others.

He moved on, however, to producing music. After producing Nikka Costa's song ""Everybody Got Their Something,"" Ronson signed a record contract with Elektra Records. His first album Here Comes the Fuzz was released in 2003 and was a critically acclaimed success that featured artists of all genres, despite initially poor sales. The most well known song from the album, "" Ooh Wee"" samples "" Sunny"" by Boney M and features Nate Dogg, Ghostface Killah, and Trife Da God. He has since produced multiple songs on the albums of singers Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse, Lily Allen, and Robbie Williams.

In 2004, he formed his own record label, Allido Records, a subsidiary of Sony BMG's J Records, along with his longtime manager Rich Kleiman. The first artist he signed to Allido was rapper Rhymefest, most well-known for winning the Grammy for co-writing Kanye West's ""Jesus Walks"".

In March 2006, Ronson released a cover of Radiohead's "" Just"" as a single. In certain areas, such as the UK, it gained major radio play. It also saw release as part of Exit Music: Songs with Radio Heads, a full Radiohead covers CD, in April, later appearing on Ronson's second album, Version, which was released in the UK on 16 April 2007. It includes other covers of a diverse selection of rock & pop songs including: Kaiser Chiefs' "" Oh My God"" (featuring guest vocals from Lily Allen), an instrumental version of Coldplay's "" God Put A Smile Upon Your Face"", Britney Spears' ""Toxic"", Ryan Adams' ""Amy"", Maxïmo Park's "" Apply Some Pressure"", The Zutons' ""Valerie"" and Kasabian's ""L.S.F."".

32,32,el arrebato,55932,466881,"Javier Labandón, más conocido por su nombre artístico El Arrebato, es un cantautor español de rumba-pop y flamenco.

Comenzó su carrera artística sobre 1985 y su carrera discográfica en 1988 sacando su primer disco con el grupo Piel morena en el que le acompañaban 2 grandes amigos de su Sevilla natal . Con ellos cosechó sus primeros éxitos hasta el 8 de septiembre de 1998, cuando Piel Morena se disolvió definitivamente tras varios cambios en la formación.

Gracias a que Piel Morena y Camela estaban en la misma discográfica (Ar Producciones), El Arrebato conoció a Dioni Martín, uno de los integrantes de Camela con el cual forjó una gran amistad.

Cuando Piel Morena se disolvió, El Arrebato mandó una maqueta a Dioni, éste se la envió a su discográfica, EMI, la cual apostó por él y decidió grabar lo que sería el primer disco de El Arrebato: Poquito a poco, con el que logró un éxito muy superior al que había tenido con Piel Morena y mucho mayor del que él mismo esperaba.

Actualmente se encuentra promocionando su último trabajo: Lo que el viento me dejó que salió a la venta el 7 de septiembre de 2010.

Lo que el viento me dejó es el sexto álbum de estudio de El Arrebato y mantiene en la cumbre una impecable carrera que comenzó con Poquito a poco (2001) para continuar con Una noche con arte (2003), Que salga el sol por donde quiera (2004), Un cuartito pa mis cosas (2006) y Mundología (2008), a los que hay que añadir un Grandes éxitos publicado en 2006.

Son álbumes que han conseguido multiplatinos, elegidos por votación popular en TVE Mejor Disco del Año (Que salga el sol por donde quiera) y que han situado a El Arrebato como uno de los grandes de la música española por su capacidad de conectar con el latido de la calle. El Himno Oficial del Centenario del Sevilla se ha convertido en un emblema, en un ejemplo más de su alcance popular y de su inspiración para unir generaciones.


En estos ocho años, El Arrebato ha lanzado canciones como Duele, Ojú lo que la quiero, Hoy me dio por ser honesto, Poquito a poco, Ve despacito, Háblame del sur, A mí na’ ma’, Búscate un hombre que te quiera, Por un beso de tu boca, Un amor tan grande, Una noche con arte, No puedo más, Dame cariño, Hoy todo va a salirme bien, Mirando pa ti... Son temas que se han incrustado en la memoria popular a los que ahora se une No lo entiendo, el primer single de su nuevo álbum Lo que el viento me dejó que se publica el 7 de septiembre.

Célebre es su declaración:

“Ser sevillista es algo tan importante para mí como otras tradiciones sevillanas.”

Growing up in a Spanish-speaking environment (born to a Cuban mother and Mexican father), she fostered her love of music by listening to Celia Cruz and Alejandro Fernández. At the age of 15, she auditioned for The X Factor in Greensboro, North Carolina. Even though she was eliminated (along with her four future groupmates), Simon Cowell recognized her talent and combined the girls to form the quintet girl group Fifth Harmony.

Despite finishing in third place, they went on to be the most successful contestants from that season. The group's debut EP, Better Together, was released in October 2013, with acoustic reworkings, Spanish versions (Juntos and Juntos Acoustic), and a remix album following a month later. Their debut single, ""Miss Movin' On,"" was the highest-charting U.S. X Factor single at the time, a feat beaten only by each successive Fifth Harmony single.

The group's debut LP, Reflection, was released in early 2015, featuring the hits ""Sledgehammer"" (written by Meghan Trainor) and ""Worth It,"" featuring rapper Kid Ink.

She gained some significant attention with her early releases, but it was her 2019 sophomore effort, Hot Pink, that took her to the top of the Hot 100.

48,48,aventura,806198,16766409,"From their roots as a Bronx-based boy band fusing bachata with hip-hop, R&B, and pop, Aventura have becme one of the most influential Latin groups of all time. Their primary signature comprises inimitable, elegant, four-part harmonies, earworm melodic hooks, and rhythmic imagination. Beginning with 2005's ""Ella y Yo"" (feat. Don Omar) they placed numerous singles inside the Top Ten, including the chart-toppers ""Por un Segundo"" and ""Dile al Amor."" Further, nine of their albums charted, including 2009's pop crossover The Last, which topped the list, as did its live follow-up, 2011's 14 +14. They have won countless Premio Lo Nuestro, Premio Juventud, and Billboard Music awards. After taking a multi-year hiatus in 2011, they returned in 2014 as part of Romeo's sold-out Yankee Stadium concert, and in 2016 played sold-out shows across Latin America, Europe, and the United States. In 2019 they issued the single ""Inmortal"" as the final chart-topping track on Romeo's Utopia album and later performed it live with him at MetLife Stadium. In 2021, Aventura teamed with Bad Bunny on the chart-topping single ""Volví."" The quartet released the single ""Brindo con Agua"" in 2024.

The group was formed in 1994 in the Bronx by four boys of Dominican heritage (Anthony ""Romeo"" Santos, Lenny Santos, Max Santos, and Henry Santos Jeter) determined to break bachata music into the pop mainstream by fusing it with sounds they heard every day on the radio, including hip-hop and R&B. Unlike other young acts seeking success, they didn't hand themselves over to a producer who would mold their image and sound. Instead, they proceeded to learn skills needed to succeed, from production and arrangement to songwriting and playing instruments. 

After years playing parties and local festivals, they caught a break and signed to BMG. They released their debut long-player, Generation Next, with the assistance of an outside producer (at the label's insistence). The group insisted on writing their own material, and they successfully resisted the label's attempt to turn them into a cookie-cutter boy band in the style of the Backstreet Boys or *NSYNC by ensuring bachata remained dominant in all their songs. Unfortunately, the album fell between the cracks of both the burgeoning Latin movement and the pop/R&B chart-toppers.

After touring regionally, opening for other acts, and playing their own shows across the East Coast, they released We Broke the Rules, a blueprint that showcased their mature style. The album title proved prescient as Romeo penned lyrics outside the subjects of romance and heartbreak, and Max's guitar work strayed from the classic, clean bachata lead and rhythmic styles by employing all manner of electronics and effects. Further, Lenny was the first to incorporate funky slap bass and chordal rock riffs into bachata. ""Obsesión,"" the set's first single, became a hit with Latin audiences, finding a strong crossover into hip-hop. The album peaked at number 56 on the Top Latin Albums list. 

While growing a North American audience, they also became popular in Europe, thanks to frequent touring. In 2003, they returned with Love & Hate, which saw them experimenting even further with their sound, adding merengue into the mix and upping the R&B/hip-hop quotient without losing touch with their background, singing in Spanish, English, and Spanglish. The set reached number 66 at Top Latin Albums. These releases, promising and adventurous as they were, were a prologue to 2005's God's Project. Widely regarded as the group's best album to date, it went all the way to number five on the Latin albums list and netted the chart-topping single ""Ella y Yo"" (feat. Don Omar); they followed with the two-CD/one-DVD set K.O.B.: Live. 

By 2007, Aventura were one of the biggest Latin groups in the world. They became the first bachata group to sell out Madison Square Garden in the round. Later that year they released Kings of Bachata: Sold Out at Madison Square Garden featuring guest performances from Miri Ben-Ari, Wisin & Yandel, and Don Omar. It topped the Tropical and Latin albums charts and placed inside the top half of the Top 200. That same year, they also took home two Lo Nuestro awards and three Billboard Music Awards. 

These successes set the table for their fifth studio outing, 2009's The Last. The best-selling set featured guest appearances from Wyclef Jean, Ludacris, Akon, and Wisin y Yandel. It netted six charting singles including the number ones ""Dime el Amor"" and ""El Malo."" The Last became the top-selling Latin album of 2009 and 2010. It spent 23 weeks at number one on the Latin Billboard chart and peaked at number five in the Top 200. Two years later, the audio-video set 14 Plus 14 arrived, featuring 14 of the group's greatest hits along with their accompanying videos. It was a swan song, and they went on hiatus in 2011 to pursue other projects. Romeo and Henry Santos both engaged in successful solo careers while Lenny and Max formed Grupo Vena.

Aventura unofficially reunited in 2014 when they performed together during Romeo's sold-out Yankee Stadium concert. They officially reunited a year later by announcing a month-long series of concerts at the United Palace Theater in New York. These took place in early 2016. That year, the band's compilation Todavía Me Amas: Lo Mejor De Aventura, peaked at number one on the Tropical albums chart. 

In April 2019 Aventura released the single and music video ""Inmortal,"" as part of Santos's fourth studio album, Utopia. It debuted at number five at Hot Latin Songs, and at number 95 on the Hot 100. Aventura won Tropical Duo/Group of the Year at the Billboard Latin Music Awards and performed ""Inmortal"" alongside Raulin Rodriguez. They also performed during Romeo's Utopia concert at the MetLife Stadium, offering ""Dile al Amor,"" ""Todavia Me Amas,"" and ""Inmortal"" (The latter, issued as a single, peaked at number one, spending 18 weeks on the Hot 100.) In December, Aventura announced the La Gira Inmortal tour, their first in a decade. It kicked off in February of 2020, but after only ten shows they were forced off the road by the COVID-19 pandemic that canceled live music all over the world. 

In August 2021, Aventura surprised fans with the release of the single and video for ""Volvi"" in collaboration with Bad Bunny. It topped the Hot Latin Songs charts and the video racked up 250 million views during its first two weeks. The quartet returned in 2024 with the single ""Brindo con Agua."" ~ Chris Nickson & Thom Jurek <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Aventura"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

59,59,dua lipa,2744595,261424605,"Dua Lipa (born August 22, 1995) is an English-Albanian singer-songwriter. She was born in London of refugee parents from the Republic of Kosovo, growing up between both countries until fully moving back to London at age 15.

Dua Lipa began to write her name in the music industry. Lipa gained attention from the specialized media as an artist after the release of her debut album in 2017,  ""Dua Lipa"" (self-titled). It won the third position on the UK Albums Chart and featured eight singles. ""New Rules""  and ""IDGAF"" have become global hits, reaching the number 1 position in countries such as Australia, Belgium, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, as well as reaching the top ten positions in more than 30 countries, including the USA for ""New Rules"" . The album featured the hits ""One Kiss"" with Calvin Harris, ""Be The One"", ""Scared To Be Lonely"" with Martin Garrix, ""No Lie"" with Sean Paul and many others.  It later received 5 nominations at the BRITs Awards, the most important British awards ceremony in music. She also won with her debut album two Grammys, ""Best Dance Recording"" for her song ""Electricity"" with Silk City, and moreover the ""Best New Artist"" award. ""Dua Lipa"" (self-titled) is the most streamed female album of all-time on Spotify.

But Lipa's great success would even come in her second album ""Future Nostalgia"", which made the promising young woman a true pillar of world pop music. Having hits such as ""Don't Start Now"", ""Break My Heart"" and ""Levitating"" , the album is currently the most played female album of the 2020's decade on Spotify and secured a Grammy at the 2021 ceremony for ""Best Pop Vocal Album"" and was present among the nominations for ""Album of the Year"". It also won the Brit Award for ""Album of the Year"". ""Future Nostalgia"" is the 2nd most streamed female album of all-time on Spotify. ""Don't Start Now"" became her most streamed hit on Spotify, nominated for ""Record of the Year"" at the Grammys. It was the biggest female song of the year 2020.

The British phenomenon has captured an all-time record on the Billboard Hot 100, all thanks to the success of ""Levitating"". The track became the longest-charting female song on the chart, with 77 weeks, being the 4th song overall to reach this astonishing feat. The same track became the biggest hit of 2021 in the United States and globally without ever reaching #1, proving once and for all that the disputed #1 position on the Billboard Hot 100, that she still doesn't have reached, doesn't define the success of an artist. For Lipa, it seems that longevity is more important than an instant success.

Her song, ""Cold Heart""  with  Elton John and  PNAU, was one of the biggest hits of 2022. She had during that year a sold-out global stadium and arena tour with ""The Future Nostalgia Tour"", marking her as a definitive icon of the beginning of the 2020's decade, especially in the European continent, her main music market.

She began her third album cycle in 2024, while also making her acting debut that year with ""Barbie"" and ""Argylle"" in 2024. Her third album, ""Radical Optimism,"" was released on May 3rd, 2024. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Dua+Lipa"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

62,62,topic,476433,5351312,"There are several artists with the name Topic.

1. Tobias Topic (born March 23, 1992) is a Croatian-German DJ, producer and musician. In 2008, he started using Logic Studio, a digital audio workstation, to produce music with the guidance of a teacher. He started his musical career on social media with the assistance of YouTube musicians who contacted him.

Topic's first release, a house song called ""Light It Up"", was released at the end of 2014 and reached more than one million views on his YouTube channel. In summer 2015, he released his debut album Miles. In 2019, he released his single ""Breaking Me"", featuring Swedish singer A7S.

In October 2020, the single reached 500 million streams on Spotify and over one billion streams overall.



2. Life for ‘Topic’ began in West LA and evolved in West Covina throughout his adolescent years. The Yin and Yang lifestyle of religious based principles instilled by his mother and hard knock life experiences learned from his father laid the foundation on which this universal rap artist was formed.

Extremely confident in his ability to write or rap about anything, hence the evolution of the epithet “Topic’. No literary form of expression can exist without a ‘Topic’. Having a true love for music since the early days of his youth, Topic began singing and writing his own lyrics in grade school. By the summer of 8th grade writing his first rhyme created a natural euphoria for the lyricist, and an addiction for which there is no cure, only temporary relief. In 1993, Topic had his first experience in a professional recording studio. He took advantage of the opportunity and learned all he could about the mechanics behind the development of a song.

An innate passion for writing combined with being outspoken and a natural leader, this lyricist is certain to accomplish what he wants. What he wants is to share his truth on different points of discussion by expressing them in his lyrics. There is truly no fear emanating from this man when a pen is in hand. In love with the lyrics that flow from his soul he stirs up the game on a mental level while stimulating your desire to move to the beat.

Along with staying modest, balancing confidence with humility and driven by a passion to spit the truth, Topic began performing in local clubs, competitions and underground spots throughout LA, the Inland Empire, and West Covina. The development of his own company BOSS (Business Over Stupid Shit) Life World Inc. is a testament to the prodigious potential the artist possesses.

Topic has endured a series of tribulations synonymous with the testing of Job. His lyrical schemes reflect the influence of his life experiences as well as those around him. Marrying his strengths, insecurities and weaknesses with the melodic element of hip-hop, it is ingenious the way he brings the truth so uninhibited it exposes the very soul of the man.

The Boss of it all with a canvas of soul felt, epic beats of street life and hard-core hustle make it difficult for you to ignore the formidable hip-hop rap artist. Possessing all attributes of a West Coast gangster but the demeanor of a true businessman, this prolific rapper honed his skills and landed a record deal with SRC Universal through the independent label Drama Family.

Previously working with “WC” of Westside Connection, Knocturnal, and Shanta formerly of Aftermath, also alongside producers such as; Johnathan “JR” Rotem, Cool and Dre, Jelly Roll, and Neff-u who has production credits for almost every music genre, and artist from Dr. Dre to U2. Now label mates with such artists as the world renowned multi-platinum selling Akon and David Banner, Topic will soon accomplish his mission to make a predominant impact in the Industry.

‘Topic’ can be defined as complex but not complicated, simplistic but by no means simple. Ardently motivated by success and God’s timing the intimate, hard-hitting songs written by this artist are sure to induce an encore. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Topic"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Papua New Guinean born singer has emerged at the very forefront of the music scene throughout the islands and beyond. His charm and charisma have captured the hearts and minds of scores of adoring fans, and his beloved songs have become household favourites time and time again. Justin's unique style and sound is an irresistible blend of pop, reggae, R&B, dancehall and island music. His music is of course heavily stemmed from his diverse musical influences, but it is also undoubtedly a result of his life experiences in his home nation Papua New Guinea, and also from many years of living, travelling and performing abroad in North America, the South Pacific and South-East Asia.

After the staggering success of Justin's debut album ""Much Love"" (2005), which produced the dance floor favourite ""I Wanna Give You Some Lovin'"" and the Pacific-wide anthem ""Much Love"", his follow-up album ""JW"" (2008) was no less impressive adding to his repertoire the sentimental ballad favourite ""In Love With U"" and the silky smooth, dancehall laced ""Fire"" - both multi-national no.1 smash hits. The expectations were high for Justin to come back strongly and reproduce the magic that he captured on his first two albums, and now after a long wait and much anticipation Justin's latest album, ""Reign of Morobe"", has finally arrived and is already proving to be his finest work to date.

Critics have labelled ""Reign of Morobe"" a ""musical masterpiece"". It features the tracks: ""Runaway"" - a fun and infectious zouk/reggaeton number about a weekend escapade, and a certified number one in several countries; ""Island Girl"" - a work of genius and a radio number one in New Zealand, this song is an incredible reworking of the classic 1950's ballads that many music listeners still cherish so dearly today; ""Your Love"" (feat. Sharzy) is an emotional and heartfelt tribute to Justin's grandmother, his lifelong hero and mentor; and the title track ""Rain of Morobe"" - featuring internationally acclaimed PNG artist O-shen. ""Rain of Morobe"" is a high energy dance track that tells the story of the torrential rains and storms that are commonplace in the Papua New Guinean province of Morobe, the place that both Justin and O-shen call home.

In ""Reign of Morobe"" listeners will witness the ever evolving talent and innovation that they have come to expect and appreciate from JW. It's unveiling is a landmark moment in Justin's successful and ongoing legacy. With hit after hit after hit, this album epitomises the term ""all killer, no filler"", and it is sure to have listeners dancing, reminiscing and rejoicing for years to come. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Wellington"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Rudimental are an east London (UK) music quartet, comprising the songwriters and producers Piers Agget, Kesi Dryden and Amir Amor, together with DJ Locksmith. 

They have stated that they are on a mission to bring back soul into electronic music, and are quoted as saying: “We aren’t just electronic bedroom producers, and we’re not just guitarists and pianists who don’t know much about making a beat”.  They grew up on everything from grime to jazz and blues, from hip-hop to house, and state: “You can’t really box us into a category, we’re more about musicality, songwriting and broader influences. We are Sly and the Family Stone, Todd Edwards and Dr. Dre in a cheeseburger!”

The original Rudimental trio go back a long way. Piers and Locksmith grew up on the same road in Hackney, with Kesi living just around the corner in Stoke Newington, where he went to the same school as Labrinth and Professor Green.  Amir joined the collective in mid-2011 after working with them on some remixes.

His parents met after Dennis performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he first interacted with Sandra, who was in attendance. He is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day school, and formally celebrated becoming a Bar Mitzvah in a religious service.

Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Dennis' limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the United States until Drake's early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, however, Dennis would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer. His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song titled ""Drake's Dad"". Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell records, which Drake vehemently denies.

Drake was raised in two Toronto neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end until grade six, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighborhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move, Drake replied, ""[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement; my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.""

He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school. He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighborhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighborhood, Drake described the school as ""not by any means the easiest school to go to."" Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background, and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school. He later graduated in October 2012.

Career - 2001–2005: Degrassi: The Next Generation
At 15, eager to begin as an actor, a high school friend introduced Drake to his father, who was an acting agent. The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks a basketball star who became physically disabled after a classmate shot him. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, ""My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV"". He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, returning for sporadic appearances until his character graduated from school. Overall, Drake appeared in a total of 145 episodes.

2006–2009: Early mixtapes and So Far Gone
Lil Wayne, the founder of Young Money Entertainment, would sign Drake to the label in 2009.
After becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as ""pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it."" The mixtape was released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies. In 2007, he released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single ""Replacement Girl"", featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever-unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with ""Replacement Girl"" being featured on the channel's ""New Joint of the Day"" segment on April 30, 2007. The song also saw Drake sample ""Man of the Year"" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including ""Ransom"", ""Forever"", and a remix to ""Brand New"". Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.

In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles ""Best I Ever Had"" and ""Successful"", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs ""I'm Goin' In"" and ""Fear"". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.

Due to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as ""one of the biggest bidding wars ever"". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album titled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means.

Drake then joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of ""Best I Ever Had"" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He underwent surgery later that year.

2010–2012: Thank Me Later and Take Care
Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.

On March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single ""Over"", which peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, ""Find Your Love"", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[76] The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, ""]Care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image]."" The third single and fourth singles, ""Miss Me"" and ""Fancy"" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.

Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.

It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire on May 8, and he had also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.

Beginning his second effort in fall 2010, Drake announced his intentions to allow for Noah ""40"" Shebib to handle most of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me Later, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and others. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be Take Care. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, ""I didn't get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed many of the songs and sonically I didn't get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round."" Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.

In January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie, to focus on the album. ""Dreams Money Can Buy"" and ""Marvins Room"" were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track listing, while ""Marvins Room"" gained Gold certification by the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio. Drake would soon release the song's music video on June 28.

""Headlines"" was released on August 9, acting as the lead single for Take Care. It was met with positive critical and commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12. It was eventually certified Platinum in both the United States and Canada. The music video for the single was released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game in January 2012. ""Make Me Proud"" was released as the album's second single, on October 16. It was the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number nine the following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88. ""Make Me Proud"" soon became Drake's fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.

Prior to the album's release, Drake had planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne, however, it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne. He had also begun collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled Y.O.L.O., but the duo decided against the project, in favor of increased concern for their respective studio albums.

Take Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. John McDonnell of NME dubbed it ""an affecting masterpiece"" and commended its ""delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive lyrics."" Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal found Drake's ""technical abilities"" to be improved and stated, ""Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up."" Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice called it ""a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West."" Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented the depth of Drake's ""moral psychodramas"" and stated, ""the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying power."" It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial success, eventually being certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the US.

The album's third and fourth singles, ""The Motto"" and Take Care"", were released on November 29, and February 21, 2012 respectively. Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with ""The Motto"" credited for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States. The music video for ""Take Care"" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, ""None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] - make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it."" The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year. The song was also featured on the channel's ""Pop Songs You Must Hear"" list of 2011. ""HYFR"" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified Gold. It would later win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video in 2012, and the channel also ranked him at number two on their ""Hottest MCs in the Game"" list.

In promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip-hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million. He then returned to acting, starring in Ice Age: Continental Drift as Ethan.

2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and commercial mixtapes
During the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer's influence over his next album. Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics prevalent previously.

In January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off of his third album at the conclusion of the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of his third album. The album's second single, ""Hold On, We're Going Home"", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful single off of the album, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song's music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the video. Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing the album's third single, ""Too Much"", alongside featured artist Sampha.

Nothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favorable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in 808s & Heartbreak. The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further promoted by the ""Would You like a Tour?"" throughout late 2013, to early 2014. It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million. Drake then returned to acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night Live, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what ""kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters"". Drake also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city. In late 2014, Drake announced that he had begun recording sessions for his fourth studio album.

In 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the Romeo Santos song Odio. He also appeared on a remix of Tuesday by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard's Rhythmic chart and number twelve on the ""Hot 100"", and released ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"" as a non-album single. The latter went double platinum in the United States.

On February 12, 2015, Drake released If You're Reading This It's Too Late onto iTunes, with no prior announcement. Despite debate on whether it is an album or a mixtape, its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money Records, a scheme that was rumored to allow Drake to leave the label. However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and If You're Reading This It's Too Late sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall. Drake proceeded If You're Reading This It's Too Late with a collaborative mixtape with Future, which was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week.

What a Time to Be Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Drake the first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the same year since 2004. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units. Drake also appeared on the cover of The Fader for their 100th issue.

2016–2017: Views and More Life
Drake announced in January 2016 that his fourth studio album would be launched during the spring, releasing the promotional single ""Summer Sixteen"" later that month. The album was originally titled Views from the six, but would later be shortened to Views. ""Summer Sixteen"" debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip-hop to more tenured artists. This move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as ""goodly brash"" or ""conventionally disrespectful."" It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake popularizing the term ""The Six"" when referencing Toronto. Drake also crashed a Bat Mitzvah in New York City on February 20, performing at the event.

Drake soon released the album's lead singles, ""Pop Style"" and the dancehall-infused ""One Dance"", on April 5. Both debuted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with ""One Dance"" becoming Drake's first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist. The single also became Drake's first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed the album's release date of April 29, and followed it up with various promotional videos. On October 15, ""One Dance"" became Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016.

Views was previewed in London, before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being made available to various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later to release a short film titled Please Forgive Me, starring frequent collaborators, Swedish twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta. As of 2019, Views remains Drake's best-selling album.

Drake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as the show's musical guest. Later, Drake was named as a member of the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury. During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the music video for ""Child's Play"" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics. On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views. At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Drake received the most nominations, with 10, winning the awards for Album of the Year and Best Hip-Hop Video. Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the course of the tour in Europe. Seven additional dates were added a day later due to overwhelming demands.

Soon after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed he would be releasing a project titled More Life in December, however he later pushed the date back to the new year. The project was described as a ""playlist of original music"", rather than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album. He was later revealed to be Spotify's most streamed artist for the second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion streams for all projects on the service, which is more than double the amount of streams he had in 2015. Drake later secured his second and third Grammy Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony. Despite multiple setbacks, Drake announced More Life would be released on March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials released through Instagram. Upon release, More Life received mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200, earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It also set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever streamed album in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music alone. The album also garnered 61.3 million streams on Spotify, dethroning Ed Sheeran's ÷ as the highest opening on the service in a single day. He later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins in a single show. Billboard also reported Drake had been present on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has the most recorded entries by a solo artist.

He then released the single ""Signs"" on June 24, as well as reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset. The singles marked his first releases since More Life, with ""Signs"" was initially released as a collaboration between Drake and French fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the ""Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2018"" fashion show. The event also had a playlist exclusively from OVO Sound, curated by label co-founder Oliver El-Khatib. Drake later hosted the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of Virginia Black. Drake then appeared in The Carter Effect documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince Carter, who was the first superstar player to appear for the Toronto Raptors since the franchise's inception in 1995. The documentary also featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and LeBron James.

2018: Scorpion and return to television
After rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer Pi'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017. Two songs would later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on January 20, 2018, marking Drake's first solo release since More Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring on a remix of the Jay-Z song ""Family Feud"" with Lil Wayne, as the lead single of the latter's Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape. Scary Hours featured the songs ""Diplomatic Immunity"" and ""God's Plan"", which both debuted within the top-ten, with the latter eventually breaking various streaming records as it debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was Drake's second as a solo artist to reach number one.

Drake earned his 70th top 40 hit after featuring on the Migos song ""Walk It Talk It"", which debuted at number eighteen, and peaked at number ten. He later featured on BlocBoy JB's debut single, ""Look Alive"", which was released on February 9, 2018. The song's entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper with the top 10 hits on the Hot 100, with 23. He then featured on a remix to ""Lemon"", a song originally released as collaboration between band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, Drake announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was releasing a single later that night. On April 6, ""Nice for What"" was released, alongside a music video, which featured several female celebrities.

After ""Nice For What"" replaced his own ""God's Plan"" on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace their former number-one debut, Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion, with a planned release date of June 29, 2018. He then released ""I'm Upset"" on May 26, as the album's third single. Scorpion was then released as a double-album, and marked Drake's longest project, with a run-time of just under 90 minutes. The album broke both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it gained 132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming service, respectively. It eventually sold 749,000 album equivalent units in its first week of sales, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.

Shortly thereafter, Drake collaborated with British hip hop promotion Link Up TV on July 7, releasing a freestyle as a part of the promotion's 'Behind Barz' segment, before releasing another freestyle a week later after featuring on Charlie Sloth's long-running Fire in the Booth program on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Drake then earned his sixth number-one hit with ""In My Feelings"" on July 21, which also spawned the viral ""#InMyFeelingsChallenge"" or ""#KiKiChallenge"". The success of ""In My Feelings"" also made Drake the record holder for most number one hits among rappers. Soon after, he released the music video for ""Nonstop"", which was filmed in London during his surprise performance at the Wireless Festival.

He then appeared on the album Astroworld, featuring uncredited vocals for the song ""Sicko Mode"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Drake announced in July 2018 that he planned to ""take 6 months to a year"" to himself in order to produce television and films, including Euphoria. He then began the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour with co-headliners Migos on August 12. This preceded collaboration with Bad Bunny titled ""Mia"", which featured Drake performing in Spanish. He later received the award for Hot Ticket Performer at the 2018 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 16. During a performance in Edmonton on November 7, Drake announced his intention to begin composing his next project in early 2019.

2019–present: Upcoming album
In February 2019, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rap Song, for ""God's Plan"", at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. During his speech, producers abruptly cut to a commercial break, leading viewers to speculate they were censoring his speech during which he criticized The Recording Academy. A legal representative for the Academy then released a statement stating ""a natural pause [led] the producers [to] assume that he was done and cut to commercial,"" and added the organization offered him an opportunity to return to stage, but he declined.

On February 14, Drake re-released his third mixtape, So Far Gone, onto streaming services for the first time to commemorate its 10-year anniversary, and later collaborated with Summer Walker on a remix of Walker's song ""Girls Need Love"", marking his first release of 2019. On April 10, 2019 during a London performance on his Assassination Vacation Tour, the OVO leader told the crowd he was working on his new album before the show. On June 8, Drake appeared on Chris Brown's single ""No Guidance"". On June 15, Drake released two songs, ""Omertà"" and ""Money in the Grave"", on his EP The Best in the World Pack to celebrate the NBA Championship win of the Toronto Raptors. On August 2, he released the compilation album Care Package, consisting of songs released between 2010 and 2016 that were initially unavailable for purchase or commercial streaming; it debuted at number one.

Artistry - influences
Drake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West, Jay Z, and Lil Wayne, while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah, and Usher. Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his ""biggest inspirations"".

Musical style
Drake has credited Kanye West (left) and Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical influences. Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism. His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as ""ting"", ""touching road"", ""talkin' boasy"" and ""gwanin' wassy"". Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip-hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing. He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.

The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional or boastful. However, Drake is often revered for incorporating ""degrading"" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between ""pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata."" Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as ""hyper-reality rap"", which is characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as being distinct from the ""real world.""

Public image
The Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States, with his single, ""The Motto"", which includes, ""You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO."" Drake later popularized the term ""The Six"" in 2015 in relation his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city. Furthermore, the subject matter of his artistry often revolving around relationships, have had widespread impact on social media through photo captions commonly used to reference emotions or personal situations. However, his lyrical contents have had a negative reception from fans and critics deeming him as sensitive; a trait that is understood as being antithetical to hip hop culture. June 10 was declared ""Drake Day"" in Houston, Texas. In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines, in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance. In 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States. He would also donate $200,000 in order to aid relief efforts in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey. In February 2018, following the single ""God's Plan"" debut at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Drake donated $50,000 to a Miami homeless shelter and giving a University of Miami student $50,000 to help with her tuition. Drake then ""kept up the spending spree"" by donating the rest of the song's video budget, $996,631.90, to several charitable causes and regular people across Miami.

The music video for ""Hotline Bling"" went viral, due to Drake's eccentric choices in dancing. The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake's unconventional nature on the song, causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, spawning several parodies. Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exampled by the video for ""Hotline Bling"". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6"" Classic Boots. This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose, in which various items of clothing were produced. Drake had also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the ""Air Jordan OVOs"". Moreover, his style and dress sense have caused GQ magazine to describe him as ""[one of] the most stylish men alive"".

Controversies - legal issues
In 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on ""Marvins Room"". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties. Despite Drake's legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling ""Jimmy Smith Rap"", a 1982 single by jazz musician, Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who stated Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on ""Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2"", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop. Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement. Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics on when collaborating with YG on the song ""Who Do You Love?"". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year. In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.

In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel ""Chubbs"" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also says the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering. The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu, after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference; the judge ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense.

Feuds
Drake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident and released a song criticizing Drake weeks later. Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute.

In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe magazine. Drake would later respond on ""6 God"" and ""6PM in New York"", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment.

Further controversy arose in July 2015, when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during recording sessions for ""RICO"", one of the lead singles off of Mill's second studio album. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller. Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for ""R.I.C.O."". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for ""R.I.C.O."", ""10 Bands"", and ""Know Yourself"". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, titled ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back"", in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with ""Wanna Know"", before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later. Despite subliminal disses from either artist, the feud has not been officially reignited. Drake would further seek to denounce Funkmaster Flex during his Madison Square Garden shows on the Summer Sixteen Tour. Following Meek Mill's sentencing of two to four years for probation violation, Drake stated ""Free Meek Mill"" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on ""Family Feud"". Pusha T would also use the same rationale to criticize Drake on ""Infrared"" in 2018, prompting Drake to respond with the ""Duppy Freestyle"" diss track on May 25. Pusha T would directly respond to the track through ""The Story of Adidon"" on May 29, which presented several claims, including an accusation of Drake fathering a secret child. The pair is considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, with Drake yet to respond to ""The Story of Adidon"".

In 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through ""4PM in Calabasas"", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on ""No Shopping"" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song. However, French Montana claimed that Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake, he has yet to officially respond to Budden. In the same year, Drake mocked Kid Cudi for his mental health, drug use and suicidal urges on ""Two Birds, One Stone"" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter. Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.

In mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator, Kanye West. In an appearance on the talk show The Shop in October, Drake recounted several business meetings with West, who voiced his desire to ""be Quincy Jones"" and work with him, in order to replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson. West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, which was agreed to as Drake ""felt a genuine vibe"" from West, and after West gifted him the beat to ""Lift Yourself"", which inspired Drake to begin writing to the instrumental. West then requested Drake to travel to Wyoming to continue working, and arrived a day after close friend 40. 40 said West was working on an album; contradictory to his previous aim of just wanting to ""give [Drake] beats"". Drake responded by saying West stated he would release in late 2018, and they should continue on. However, upon his arrival in Wyoming, Drake ""[spent] the majority of time working on [West's] music"", only exploring his own after playing the producer the song ""March 14"", which addresses Drake's relationship with his newborn son and co-parent. This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T. West would also release ""Lift Yourself"", and produce ""Infrared""; actions that greatly displeased Drake. This prompted him to denounce West in several songs and live performances. West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018.

Drake has purported to have been in reported feuds with DMX, Kendrick Lamar, Common, The Weeknd, XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez, and Ludacris, although the latter three have been reported to be resolved.

Business ventures - Endorsements
Prior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient. In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger King and Whataburger. Business magazine Forbes commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships ""combined heavily"" for Drake's reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the highest-paid celebrities during that period.

Main article: OVO Sound
During the composition of Nothing Was the Same, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, and business partner, Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the trio to team up to form OVO Sound. The name is an abbreviation derived from the October's Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects. Warner Bros. Records currently distribute the label.

Drake, 40 and PartyNextDoor were the label's inaugural artists. The label houses artists including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, OB O'Brien, Roy Woods, dvsn, Plaza, and Kash Doll, as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Mike Zombie, Nineteen85, and Future the Prince. OVO Sound has released six albums, with two certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Toronto Raptors
On September 30, 2013, at a press conference with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke, Drake was announced as the new ""global ambassador"" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. This would also be the setting where Drake was given The Key to the City. In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities, beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary. He began by hosting an annual ""Drake Night"" segment with the organization, which began in 2013.

Apple Music
Following the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million. This saw all future solo releases by Drake becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers. Drake had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted More Life. Drake's partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform's sharp success, as it attained 10 million subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists, such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services. Through signing with the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before the smartwatch saw public release.

Virginia Black
Two months prior to the release of Views, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based whiskey. This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring's Restaurant in Toronto. The beverage was created and also distributed alongside Proximo Spirits, as well as with Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008. The company described the partnership as ""fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey.""

The product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically. The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music and various tours, such as being part of the ""Virginia Black VIP Lounge"" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016. The company later aired commercials with Dennis Graham, which featured the tagline of ""The Realest Dude Ever"" (in reference toward ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to various European countries in 2017.

Personal life
Drake lives in Hidden Hills, California, since 2012. He also owns a property in Toronto, which was built from the ground-up in 2017, and a Toronto condo adjacent to the CN Tower. He owns a Boeing 767 airplane.

Drake's paternal uncles are bass guitarist Larry Graham and musician Teenie Hodges. Graham achieved both critical and commercial success as a member of the band Sly and the Family Stone, while Hodges featured as the lead guitarist and songwriter for Al Green, and contributed heavily on much of his work in the 1970s, including the hits ""Take Me to the River"", ""Love and Happiness"", and ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"".

Drake is a father to one son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French artist Sophie Brussaux. Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumors after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017; Drake eventually confirmed his fatherhood on the album Scorpion in 2018.

Drake dated singer Rihanna off-and-on from 2009 to 2016. He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums, and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said ""she's a woman I've been in love with since I was 22 years old."" On becoming a single parent, he mused on the talk show The Shop:

As life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don't have the fairy tale, like, 'Oh, Drake started a family with Rihanna and this is like so perfect.' It looks so good on paper. By the way, I wanted that too at one time.

Other artists
There are several other artists that have performed under the name Drake:
1) heavy metal act
2) Jason Drake

92,92,yot club,1193770,25501089,"Ryan Kaiser, known professionally as Yot Club, is an American bedroom pop artist originating from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and presently based in Nashville, Tennessee.

Kaiser embarked on a musical journey prior to Yot Club under the moniker Amateur Observer, sharing his creations on platforms like SoundCloud and Bandcamp. Despite its existence for about a year, Kaiser eventually deleted the project due to feelings of insecurity.

Transitioning to Yot Club, Kaiser's musical identity took shape upon entering the music scene in 2019. His sound is characterized by distorted vocals, lo-fi beats, guitar tracks enriched with chorus pedal effects, warm guitar leads, analog synth melodies, and light pads.

Embracing a minimalist approach to recording, Kaiser intentionally operates within self-imposed limitations, such as employing a single microphone. This streamlined technique fuels his creativity and encourages innovative experimentation. His compositions typically begin with guitar foundations, which he gradually augments with additional instruments. Kaiser's meticulous processing of vocals, incorporating clip distortion and reverb, results in a signature tone.

Most music is created in his bedroom, and on occasion, he transforms his car into a miniature recording studio. Despite the modest setting, Kaiser's inventive prowess shines through in his compositions. This creative endeavor has garnered significant recognition, with his music amassing over two million streams on Spotify.

His artistic approach is rooted in a sense of preservation, viewing his music as a digital diary that deserves a place in the world. The desire to safeguard his creations from potential loss or obscurity drove Kaiser to release his music to the public.

Kaiser's discography under the Yot Club alias has exhibited remarkable productivity. Since his 2019 debut, he has released three EPs and a total of twenty-six tracks within a single year. 

A pivotal moment in Kaiser's career came with his signing to Nice Guys, a record label headquartered in Paris. This partnership facilitated the release of his work to a wider audience, including the notable EP ""Nature Machine,"" which debuted on July 14, 2020. The EP, along with eight additional tracks, is showcasing his versatility through covers of songs by The Smiths and Mountain Goats. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Yot+Club"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

94,94,bts,1889136,2229509777,"BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band formed in Seoul in 2013. The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several world tours.

The group initially formed as teenagers under Big Hit Entertainment and released their debut single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. Billboard 200 entries The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 (2015), The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016), and Wings (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. Wings became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) with their single ""Mic Drop"". The band is the first Korean act to top the U.S. Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums Love Yourself: Answer (2018) and Map of the Soul: Persona (2019), making BTS the first group since The Beatles to earn three number one albums in less than a year, and the fastest to earn three number one albums since The Monkees in 1967. Love Yourself: Answer also broke South Korea's Gaon Album Chart's all-time monthly record previously set by Love Yourself: Tear and became the first Korean album certified Gold in the United States.

According to Gaon Music Chart, BTS has sold fifteen million albums domestically and is the best-selling artist to debut in the 2010s. They hold the best-selling album in Korean history with Map of the Soul: Persona. BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the IFPI's Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. The group has won Top Social Artist three years in a row and Top Duo/Group at the 26th Billboard Music Awards. Featured on Time's international cover as ""Next Generation Leaders"", BTS has appeared in the magazine's 25 most influential people on the internet (2017–2019) and Time's 100 most influential people in the world (2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname 'Princes of Pop'. Forbes Korea named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018, and BTS ranked 43rd in the Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities.

96,96,armin van buuren,1606409,55864542,"Armin van Buuren (born Armin Jozef Jacobus Daniël van Buuren, December 25, 1976) is a trance (mostly progressive trance and uplifting trance) music producer and DJ from the Netherlands. His musical career started in 1995.

He has been named number one in the prestigious DJ MAG Top 100 poll four times in a row, from 2007 till 2010 and for the 5th time in 2012. He's the first DJ in the history of the DJ Magazine to achieve that and an indication of his prolific output over more than 14 years he’s been dj’ing and producing. Being the official World’s Most Popular DJ is just one of his many achievements, but the driving force behind his success is an overriding passion for electronic dance music.

2008 began with the success that the number one DJ seems to attract; he was awarded with the prestigious Buma Cultuur Pop Award in January. This was followed by being voted as the Best Trance Artist in the Beatport Music Awards in March; judged on the musician’s artistic achievements, national and international success, it is evident that Armin van Buuren has become one of the decade’s most influential trance acts.

Even a basic list of recent successes reads like a lifetime of work: ‘Best Album’ for artist album ‘Shivers’ at both the Dutch Release Dance Awards and the prestigious Edison Awards; ‘Best Compilation’ for ‘A State Of Trance’, in 2006, claiming the ‘Best European DJ’ award in 2007 and ‘Best Mix Radio Show’ at the Miami Winter Music Conference in 2006 and 2007, for radio show ‘A State Of Trance’ – now broadcasting on a massive 40 FM stations as well as satellite and internet radio, with over 26 million listeners a week; a 5th year residency in Ibiza at Amnesia and over 50,000 downloads every week from podcasting high end chart-bothering positions all over the world for singles, albums and compilations , with single “Rush Hour” used as the theme tune to the UEFA European Youth Championship; the #1 entry in the Dutch album charts with his artist album ‘Imagine’, the #1 entry of the DVD registration of ‘Armin Only ‘ Imagine’ – the landmarks just keep coming!

The 350th episode and the 7th year of the hit radio show ‘A State of Trance’ was celebrated in May 2008 with an eight hour live broadcast from Antwerp in Belgium to over 40 radio stations internationally. Fans were invited to a free party with a line up that had been voted for by the show’s listeners; another example of the importance the DJ places on the satisfaction of his fans. Considering the popularity of the radio show the introduction of ‘A State of Trance Podcast’ was a natural progression. The weekly podcasts which contain highlights and Armin’s favourite tracks from the previous episode ensure that trance lovers across the world will never miss another episode!
Sold-out shows for Armin Only in 2005 and 2006 created eager anticipation of the third edition, which kicked off in a sold-out Jaarbeurs in Utrecht in 2008; over 16,000 fans attended and were enthralled by the DJ’s nine hour set. The theme of the night was ‘Imagine’, described by Armin as “the celebration of our sensations both in life and in clubland.” Fans all around the world should not despair, as ‘Armin Only’ tour dates have also been set for Romania, Poland, Belgium and Australia; the DJ will also be touring in England, Scotland, Ibiza, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, and the USA, with expected dates in, for an example, the Czech Republic.

Born in Leiden, Holland (on December 25, 1976) to a musical family, Armin indulged his passion for music from a young age. He spent all the money he earned with his paper round on records. His mum won a computer when he was 10, gaining Armin’s interest. “So as a little nerdy kid I was writing my own basic programmes, and learnt about the technology from there.” He progressed from making low-profile mix tapes for friends to higher profile mixes when he discovered experimenting with different sequences on his computer through his uncle. “I was so stunned by what I saw him doing on the computer, that I got addicted to creating music right there and then!”
“I loved dance music immediately – this great rebellious sound that was so different to the ‘beautiful’ songs of the years before”. Armin cites electronic pioneer Jean Michel Jarre as a major influence (famed for his awesome visuals as well as his groundbreaking synth sounds), as well as Dutch producer Ben Liebrand, who later mentored him in his mixing and producing.
In the early days, Armin thought it was wise to have something extra in case the DJ’ing didn’t work out. So he studied for a law degree. The final year of his course was inevitably stretched as he juggled his studies with his increasingly hectic schedule; his rise to fame included lots of productions and remixes, as well as playing out to packed clubs every weekend. It took him three years to graduate, but his determination made him succeed!

Armin’s own productions have all made a huge impact and quickly gain worldwide acclaim; his latest artist album titled ‘Imagine’ entered the Dutch Album Top 100 Chart at number one; this is the first time a dance producer has ever accomplished such a feat in the history of Dutch music. The first single to be taken from this album, ‘Going Wrong’ with DJ Shah featuring Chris Jones, entered the Dutch Singles Chart at number five. The ‘Armin Only DVD’ was also released and reached the acclaimed number one spot in its second week. His back catalogue includes Blue Fear, Communication, Sound of Goodbye, Shivers, Rush Hour, Burned With Desire, Exhale, Love You More, This World Is Watching Me, and Yet Another Day. While the remix offers flood in, Armin only takes on tracks that he really loves. He uses exactly the same criteria for his compilations, meaning that every release from Armin or his long-running Armind label is a bone fide stormer that’s earned its place. His output includes tracks for the cult TV series 24, and the likes of Motorcycle’s As The Rush Comes.
Armin is a dedicated trance lover, but isn’t imprisoned by a single genre, saying “What makes trance work so well is that it doesn’t stick to one style, and can incorporate electro, minimal, whatever it likes.” His desire to showcase more of the great music he hears, along with the number of people sending him tracks they wanted to release, led to the obvious step of starting his own label, Armada, in 2003.

The label is a joint venture between Armin, Maykel Piron (former head of A&R for Warner Music) and David Lewis, who'd previously managed Armin. ""What we wanted was a company that could offer everything for an artist: representation, a booking agency, and a record company. Artists can choose full management, or to just release a record or play out at gigs. Armada lets the artists choose what they want without telling them what to do"".

109,109,nf,1067520,75146131,"NF is the stage name of rapper and composer Nate Feuerstein from Gladwin, Michigan. Feuerstein endured a hardship-filled childhood in which his parents divorced, his mother's boyfriend physically abused him, and his mother eventually killed herself. Music was his escape, and he began recording songs on a karaoke machine, with instrumentals on one microphone and his raps in the other. Placing second in a nationwide Fine Arts Festival rap competition in 2008, and first in Michigan the following year, he independently released a debut album, Moments, in 2010. The album attracted the attention of Xist Music, which signed him to a recording deal in 2012, by which time Feuerstein had taken on the stage name NF. The label announced the release of an EP that same year, but it never appeared, and NF and Xist parted ways. NF spent the next two years looking for a label and working with local producer Tommee Profitt in his studio; they came up with the song ""Wake Up,"" which convinced Capitol Christian Music Group to sign him. CMG released a six-song (including a Manny Marroquin remix of ""Wake Up"") self-titled EP late in the summer of 2014. His debut album, Mansion, was released in early 2015 and reached number 62 on the Billboard 200 while topping the Christian Albums chart. The aptly titled Therapy Session followed in 2016 and also topped the Christian Albums chart with its raw emotions and honest lyrics.

NF achieved mainstream popularity in 2017 with Perception; the album charted at number one in the United States and was certified platinum, while its third single, ""Let You Down"", reached number twelve on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was a top-ten hit internationally.

Toni Watson grew up in Mount Martha on the Mornington Peninsula to the south of Melbourne, in the Australian state of Victoria. Conflicting reports state she was born either in 1993 or in 2000. The artist prefers not to disclose her birth details, ""I never denied my age. I never lied about it. I just don't say anything now... Everything is wrong online.""

She explained choosing a music career: ""One day I was at the park with my family, all my cousins and stuff, in Frankston... We were all just singing a song and my aunty was like 'oh guys, she can actually hold a note.' I think that's the earliest memory of someone actually pointing me out as someone that has an ability to sing. I was probably like 7 years old.""

In 2009, as Toni Watson, she created a YouTube page and posted a cappella cover versions of songs. She performed local gigs and festivals, including the Let Go festival. Tones was the vocalist for a duo in 2014, and remembered: ""I started out singing in small pubs and bars in Mornington, I was singing along to a guitarist until I ended up branching out on my own."" She explained her shift to a solo career: ""I actually got made redundant from my retail job and with that money I bought an RC300 (loop station) and just started to try to figure it all out."" She busked ""up and down the east coast with her synthesizers and loop pedal, she has been building a loyal fanbase and captivating crowds with her genre-diverse style.""

In September 2017, the singer-songwriter travelled to Byron Bay in the Australian state of New South Wales to try busking there. At an early performance, she met Jackson Walkden-Brown who became her manager about a month later. Her busking success led to a greater commitment to a music career. The artist spent 2018 living between Walkden-Brown's home in the Gold Coast hinterland and in her van in Byron Bay, writing music and busking full-time. Later that year she won the Battle of the Buskers at Buskers by the Creek. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tones+and+I"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

136,136,coldplay,7901934,610505378,"Coldplay is a British alternative rock and britpop band formed in London in 1997. They consist of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion and creative director Phil Harvey. They met at University College London and began playing music together from 1996 to 1998, initially calling themselves Starfish. Coldplay's music incorporates elements of soft rock, pop rock, piano rock, and post-britpop.

After independently releasing an extended play, Safety (1998), Coldplay signed with Parlophone in 1999. The band's debut album, Parachutes (2000), included their breakthrough single ""Yellow"" and received a Brit Award for British Album of the Year, a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album and a Mercury Prize nomination. Their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), won the same accolades and included ""Clocks"", which earned a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. In 2005, they released X&Y; the album was marked by a troubled production and various delays, completing what the band considered a trilogy as well. Coldplay's fourth effort, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), received a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album and their first Album of the Year nomination, while its title track was the first British group song to reach number-one in the United Kingdom and United States simultaneously in the 21st century. Both X&Y and Viva la Vida were the best-selling albums of their respective years, topping the charts in more than 30 countries each.

Since then, Coldplay further diversified their sound with the subsequent releases Mylo Xyloto (2011), Ghost Stories (2014), A Head Full of Dreams (2015), Everyday Life (2019) and Music of the Spheres (2021). Each album presented a unique theme and added new musical styles to the band's original repertoire, including electronica, ambient, pop, R&B, funk, classical, jazz fusion, and progressive rock. They are also known for ""euphoric"" live performances, which NME said are when the band ""come alive and make the most sense"". To celebrate their 20th anniversary in 2018, a career-spanning documentary directed by Mat Whitecross was premiered at selected cinemas, featuring previously unseen behind-the-scenes footage.

With 100 million albums sold worldwide, Coldplay are the most successful band of the 21st century and one of the best-selling music acts of all time. According to Fuse, they are also the sixth-most awarded group in history. Other notable achievements include the seventh-highest-grossing tour of all time, three of the 50 highest-selling albums ever in the United Kingdom, the most number-one records in the country without ever missing the top, most nominations and wins for a band in Brit Awards history, and becoming the first British group to debut at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100. Coldplay are considered one of the most influential bands of the 21st century as well, with Forbes describing them as the standard for the current alternative scene. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included A Rush of Blood to the Head on their ""200 Definitive Albums"" list and the single ""Yellow"" is part of their ""Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll"" exhibition for being one of the most successful and important recordings in the industry. In spite of their popularity and impact, Coldplay have earned a reputation as polarizing music icons.

Mr. Probz had been creatively active since a young age, already occupying himself with graffiti as a youngster and writing lyrics about his every day experiences. At a young age he was faced with the typical trials and tribulations of inner city youth growing up, spending large portions of his time on the streets and viewing his music as the one path out of a life of poverty and crime.

August 6 th 2010, Mr. Probz got shot down in the centre of Amsterdam. In the hospital the popular hip hop artist received massive attention from the Dutch media and support from fellow musicians and fans. Within days after his release from the hospital, Mr. Probz was already back to focusing on his music. Half a year after the accident, the Dutch hit song ‘Meisje Luister’ of him and Kleine Viezerik was a #1 hit at the FunX Hip Hop Chart.

In 2010 Mr. Probz was nominated for a BNN/State Award in the category ‘Best Artist’. He was the first unsigned artist to get this nomination in the award show’s history.

In the Dutch motion picture 'Bolletjes Blues' Mr. Probz plays the role of lead character Jimmy. ‘Bolletjes Blues’ was the first Dutch hip hop film.

In his career Mr. Probz recorded and worked closely with artists like Alchemist, Joell Ortiz, Joe Budden, Scott Storch, Yukmouth, Grafh, Raekwon, Royce da 5’9 and Giorgio Tuinfort (Konvict Music), among many others.

140,140,vendredi sur mer,362603,5260821,"From Geneva, Switzerland, although her nationality is usually defined as Franco-Swiss. Her name is Charline Mignot, but artistically she is known as Vendredi sur Mer.

Coming into the world in the mid 90's, Charline grows up with a very introverted view of the world around her. As she grew up and wanted to explain her surroundings in her own way, she moved more and more towards the arts, fashion and photography, and it is in the latter that she dedicated her studies.

In his quest to make his own mark and push his own boundaries within the aesthetics he used for his photographs, he eventually started writing songs. The first time was with the idea of using self-made music for her photo shoots, knowing that music would help set the mood within the shoot. That's how her first song, ""Est-ce que tu t'en souviens"", was created.

Their style is quite distinctive, having been described as dream-pop, electro-pop, electro-ambient and even ""space-disco"". The marriage of Charline's art and direction caught the attention of Swiss and French producers, including Lewis Ofman, who produced her most listened-to single, ""La femme á la peau bleue"", in 2016, a song that became famous in the fashion world as the official music for one of Sonia Rykiel's 2017 collections.

Mignot's voice is always soft, as if she were singing from a reverie. She uses a spoken voice in all her songs, which come across best as storytelling about women, sensuality, love and heartbreak. In some interviews she has expressed frustration at being associated with radical feminism just because her music is about women, ""as if it's something abnormal or radicalised for a woman to write about women instead of men"", so she often says that she goes between one gender and the other, to create confusion among listeners.

Vendredi sur Mer's first EP came out in 2017 and is called ""Marée basse"", the only studio album she has released to date is called ""Premiers émois"" and was released in 2019 with the single ""Chewing-Gum"".

Do you like women who make music independently and maintain a beautiful aesthetic to match their creations and their music videos?

143,143,rex orange county,1703760,101248410,"Alexander James O'Connor (born 4 May 1998), known professionally as Rex Orange County, is an English singer, multi-instrumentalist, and songwriter. O'Connor rose to prominence in 2017 following multiple features on Tyler, the Creator's Grammy-nominated album Flower Boy, including the single ""Boredom"". NPR Music journalist Zoë Jones has described O'Connor's music as ""a bright blend of hip-hop, jazz, and bedroom pop”.

Under the Rex Orange County moniker, O'Connor has released one mixtape, bcos u will never b free, and three studio albums: Apricot Princess, Pony, and Who Cares?. Both Pony and Who Cares? made the top 5 in the UK and US, and the latter topped the UK Albums Chart. O'Connor also released a live album, entitled Live at Radio City Music Hall, in 2020.

Alexander James O'Connor was born on 4 May 1998, to Nina and Phil O'Connor, a professional sports photographer. He grew up in the village of Grayshott, Hampshire near Haslemere. O'Connor's interest in music began at a young age. At age 5, O'Connor joined the choir at the school where his mother worked. He became a drummer and later taught himself piano. The name Rex Orange County is based on a teacher-given nickname, ""The OC"", after his surname O'Connor.

At age 16, O'Connor began playing the guitar and started to produce his own music using Apple's Logic software. At this age, he also began attending the BRIT School where he studied drumming and was one of four percussionists in his year; the relative rareness of his primary instrument provided him with wide exposure to various projects of others in his school which he credits with exposing him to new music.

On 4 September 2015, O'Connor self-released his debut album bcos u will never b free on SoundCloud and Bandcamp. Upon listening to the album, fellow English musician and producer Two Inch Punch got in touch with him, providing him with a management team. The two have continued to collaborate throughout O'Connor's career in the form of the tracks ""UNO"", ""Best Friend"", and ""Untitled"". The album also caught the attention of American rapper Tyler, the Creator, who sent him an email describing his enjoyment of the project. This led to him flying O'Connor out the following year to Los Angeles to collaborate on his album Flower Boy, with him co-writing and contributing vocals to the songs ""Boredom"" and ""Foreword"". On 17 November 2016, O'Connor released the single ""UNO"", a song Clash magazine described by writing, ""The buoyant keyboard riff underpins a hypnotic half-spoken vocal, one that veers from topic to topic in a hazy burst of creative mania."" On 25 January 2017, he released the single “Best Friend” (premiering on Apple Music's Beats 1 station), followed later in the year by the release of his second album Apricot Princess. His work was compared by Aimee Cliff of The Fader in 2017 to ""other artsy, post-genre teen artists, such as Kevin Abstract or Steve Lacy"".

O'Connor's first release following the success of Apricot Princess and Flower Boy was on 11 October 2017 with the single ""Loving Is Easy"", created in collaboration with the Dutch artist Benny Sings. On 16 April 2018, he performed the song in his television debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. On 31 May 2018, he released a cover of ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" in collaboration with Randy Newman, the creator of the song. He was also featured in Spotify's Rise Program.

On 9 October 2018, O'Connor was scheduled to appear on the French television program Quotidien, but refused to perform because it featured a sketch by comedian Alison Wheeler parodying the Ku Klux Klan, which he called ""tasteless"".

On 14 February 2019, O'Connor released the single ""New House"". Later that year on 12 September, he released ""10/10""; the lead single from his third album Pony. Released on 25 October 2019, Pony was his first major-label album released through RCA Records.

On 30 September 2020, O'Connor released an EP with recordings from his performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City during his Pony tour titled Live at Radio City Music Hall alongside a documentary released on YouTube. This documentary showed the events leading up to this performance as well as the early conclusion of the Pony tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In October 2020, O'Connor confirmed that he was in the process of recording a fourth studio album titled Who Cares? In January 2021, he liked a Tweet seemingly confirming that it would be released at some point later that year. However, this did not materialize. On 13 January 2022, he began officially teasing the album, sending out postcards containing a phone number that when called, a snippet of the song would play. The album was released on 11 March 2022, and was his first to top the UK Albums Chart, entering ahead of Impera by Ghost.

Growing up, O'Connor listened to Queen, ABBA, Stevie Wonder, and American alternative artists like Weezer and Green Day. He cites these artists and others as core inspirations for his own music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Rex+Orange+County"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Her songs ""Alaska"" and ""Dog Years"" placed numbers 64 and 173 on Triple J Hottest 100, 2016, respectively.

After the Pharrell video went viral, several different record labels tried to sign Rogers. She ended up negotiating a contract with Capitol Records where ""she licenses her music to them through her own imprint, Debay Sounds."" As a result, she has more control over her sound and image than many artists at a similar place in their music careers.

Rogers's EP, Now That the Light Is Fading, was released on February 17, 2017. She released her major-label debut album, Heard It In a Past Life, in January 2019. The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200.

She made her television debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on February 15, 2017, Saturday Night Live debut on November 3, 2018 and Today Show debut on July 12, 2019.

She cites Carrie Brownstein, Patti Smith, Kim Gordon, and Björk as her musical inspirations, while prominent singers Brandi Carlile and Sharon Van Etten - who she calls her ""musical big sisters"" - have become mentors. She also mentioned in her initial conversation with Williams that she has synesthesia, a benign condition where one or more senses is perceived at once.

149,149,yoasobi,664230,39699822,"YOASOBI (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese music duo composed of vocaloid music producer Ayase and vocalist Ikura (幾田りら/Lilas Ikuta). The group has released four music videos, all of which are based on short stories posted on Monogatary, a website operated by Sony Music Japan, later also from various novels and book tie-ups.

The name ""YOASOBI"" originates from the Japanese word 夜遊び, meaning ""nightlife"". Ayase, who is a producer of the group said he named it as a wish that he could take on various playful challenges by comparing the appearance of acting as an individual to the appearance of daytime and the appearance of two people acting as YOASOBI as the appearance of the night.

The group has a slogan ""novel into music"" (小説を音楽にする, shōsetsu o ongaku ni suru), , which goes along with their amazing ability to create songs with incredibly meaningful lyrics, especially when it comes to their themes for various anime and games.

2019-2020: Formation and rising up with ""Yoru ni Kakeru""
Both members of YOASOBI had active music careers prior to forming the group. Ayase gained a following on the video hosting site Niconico since his first upload on 24 December 2018, a song titled Sentensei Assault Girl (先天性アサルトガール). On 23 November 2019, he released an EP, Yūrei Tōkyō (幽霊東京), which reached third on iTunes' album chart. Ikuta, performing under the name Rira Ikuta (幾田りら), had already released two EPs: Rerise in 2017 and Jukebox in 2019.

The first song released by the duo was ""Yoru ni Kakeru"", based on Mayo Hoshino's short story ""Thanatos no Yūwaku"" hosted on Monogatary.

Pall and Taggart first made a name for themselves by creating remixes of their favorite indie bands that garnered tens of millions of streams. The duo released its official debut single, ""#Selfie,"" which celebrated and skewered 2010s narcissism, in January 2014. The track's bouncy beats and self-obsessed words hit number one on the Billboard dance chart and sold over ten million copies.

More singles, including ""Kanye"" and ""Let You Go,"" followed.

In 2015, they issued the Bouquet EP on Disruptor Records, a softer and more indie-flavored effort that featured the single ""Roses,"" which was certified double-platinum and hit number one on the Top Dance Songs chart. The song also earned the Chainsmokers nominations for the Billboard Music Awards in the Top Dance/Electronic Artist and Top Dance/Electronic Song categories. After playing over 300 shows in 2015, including dates at festivals like Lollapalooza, Firefly, Tomorrowland, and Ultra, the duo returned in 2016 with the platinum-certified ""Don't Let Me Down,"" a collaboration with Pittsburgh pop singer Daya that topped the Billboard dance chart and would later win a Grammy.

Once it hit number one, it remained in the top spot for over ten weeks, breaking the record previously held by Drake's ""One Dance.""

Kahan followed it up with the release of ""Northern Attitude"" on September 16.

On October 14, 2022, Kahan released his album Stick Season. According to early reviews of the album from AP News, ""There’s irony there because these feel like songs both longtime listeners and newer fans will want to belt back to Kahan — not because they’re produced for stadiums or arenas, but because they’re full of nostalgic melodies that will resonate far beyond New England."" Kahan wrote this album during the pandemic which he spent back home in Vermont. Stick Season leans more into the folk genre than the rest of his older music which were more pop sounding. Kahan says that in his album, Stick Season, he wanted to pay homage to the folk singers that he grew up listening to. He adds that his greatest goal as a songwriter is to write music that other people can relate to and to be able to throw that lifeline to someone.

El mayor tiene solo 26 años y el menor 21. Son jóvenes, sí, pero ya son conscientes de su éxito y más que un grupo, ellos se consideran una familia, pues lo más importante, antes de cantar, es la unión y la lealtad a su amistad.

Todo comenzó en junio del año 2007 cuando se conocieron en un asado que organizó un amigo que tenían en común. Conversando se dieron cuenta de que los cuatro eran músicos y terminaron cantando hasta las 6 de la mañana.

Días después El Profe buscó a Dim y al Llanero y les propuso formar un grupo, pero Dim dijo que sí con la condición de que también incluyeran a Pablito, quien estaba de viaje en ese momento en Contadora, Panamá.

Fue tanta la emoción y la ansiedad por crear el grupo que inmediatamente llamaron a Pablito a Panamá y el aceptó sin dudarlo.

Paso a paso
Su segundo encuentro, o mejor dicho su primer ensayo, fue en el club house de un amigo del edificio San Mitchel, en el piso 21, desde donde se podía ver la ciudad d medellin completa. Este se convirtió durante varios meses en su ensayadero oficial y era allí donde pasaban noches enteras montando las canciones.

""Durante esas noches soñábamos con que algún día escucharían nuestras composiciones en todas esas casa que veíamos desde allá"", cuenta Dim.

""Y creo que lo estamos logrando, pero ahora la idea es que también nos escuchen en aquellas de las que solo veíamos la luz, arriba en las montañas"", continúa El Profe.

Su nombre
A la hora de pensar en cómo se llamarían, dieron muchas vueltas y hasta lo consultaron con sus familias y sus profesores.

Al principio le buscaron por el lado de sus iniciales o pensaron en jugar un poco con los nombres de David y Pablo, pero luego de intentarlo por muchos lados, se les ocurrió Piso 21, pues fue a esta altura donde realmente conformaron el grupo.

Pero a este nombre también le han encontrado una metáfora, pues según ellos, indica que para arriba es adonde quieren llegar, dando pasos lentos, pero seguros y muy largos.

Precisamente antes de empezar cada concierto, el grupo se reúne para gritar su frase favorita ""Piso 21, vamos pa'arriba papá"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Piso+21"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

164,164,lizzo,1510354,48293557,"Melissa Jefferson (born April 27, 1988 in Detroit, Michigan, U.S.), known professionally as Lizzo, is an American rapper and singer. She is a founding member of indie hip hop groups The Chalice, Grrrl Prty, The Clerb, Ellypseas, and Absynthe. Her debut album, Lizzobangers, was released in 2013. In 2015, she released her sophomore album, Big Grrrl Small World.

Born in Detroit in the late 80’s, Lizzo spent much of her formative years in the church, where she was raised on the gospel sounds of The Winans, The Clark Sisters, and Fred Hammond, along with mainstay secular artists such as Stevie Wonder and Elton John. At the age of 10 her family moved to Houston, TX, and Lizzo was exposed to a wide array of emerging Southern musical styles, from the trademark chopped and screwed rap tracks of the underground, to the progressive and polished R&B sounds of groups like Destiny’s Child that were raising the city’s national profile to new heights. In fact, it was after she stumbled across a Destiny’s Child performance at Wal-Mart that Lizzo—then a 5th grader-- was inspired to start writing music on her own. Over the next decade that decision would take her through the trenches of some of the most varied musical genres: R&B girl groups (I.N.I.T.I.A.L.S., Cornrow Clique), progressive rock bands (Elypseas), solo rap ventures, and electro-pop duos (Lizzo & The Larva Ink).

In 2011 she made the move to Minneapolis with Larva Ink in order to be a part of that city’s blossoming and collaborative musical community. Lizzo & The Larva Ink was well received there, and the group earned a few encouraging nods from the press. Lizzo was soon introduced to Sophia Eris and Claire de Lune, with whom she would form The Chalice, the three-piece all-female rap/R&B group that would elevate Lizzo’s profile and reputation. In 2012 The Chalice released We Are The Chalice, an album that would gain them instant local success amongst fans and critics alike, garnering City Pages’ prestigious Best New Band and Picked To Click accolades in the same year. 

The success brought setbacks, though, and a falling out soon led to the demise of Lizzo & The Larva Ink. Feeling discontent with the loss of one group and the hurried blur of success of another, Lizzo was creatively drained from writing We Are The Chalice in two short months. She found herself in the throes of her first full-blown case of writer’s block. Unable to create music for herself, she began listening to several different local albums in hopes of finding inspiration. It was LAVA BANGERS, a 20-track instrumental mixtape from Doomtree producer and Minneapolis music vet Lazerbeak, that ultimately caught her ear. Beaks’ beats proved the fix for Lizzo’s problem. “I sat at home and listened to LAVA BANGERS, and when “Lift Every Voice” came on, my writer’s block was cured,” says Lizzo. “I think it revived my gospel roots. I wrote pages and pages of songs, and finally reached out to Lazerbeak, not thinking anything would come of it.” 

Her timing could not have been better. Beak, impressed with Lizzo’s output with The Chalice, as well as her guest appearances on several other local releases, was looking for a change of pace from his daily Doomtree production and business responsibilities. He immediately signed on to work on some demos. Beat tapes were exchanged, songs were written, and mutual friend and musical collaborator Ryan Olson (Totally Gross National Product founder, Gayngs/Marijuana Deathsquads mastermind) was brought on board to creatively oversee the project. Olson recorded and edited all 15 tracks in his bedroom studio, bringing in laid back hype-man Cliff Rhymes along the way to add even more layers to Lizzo’s dynamic vocals.

LIZZOBANGERS is the culmination of that four-way collaboration, an album that manages to capture all of the varied musical influences of Lizzo’s upbringing and combine them with the forward-thinking experimental production style of Beak and Olson. The end result is a brave new project that encapsulates the best parts of both the familiar and the future.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lizzo"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

165,165,bon entendeur,145269,1852550,"From shared passions was born an extraordinary project: Bon Entendeur. A duo in love with French culture and curious to invent hybrid formats fed by their passions. The result: Aller-retour. A cluster of beautiful ideas gathered in a unique album. 

Their adventure starts with a rather classical approach: arranging playlists fed with music they like. They gradually added what would become their trademark: the grain of a personality's voice on mixed music. Their format is declined during 5 years, 40 mixtapes, more than 70 million listening. A quality signature. Bon Entendeur has this desire to talk about culture in its original version. This sense of aestheticism, of appropriateness. And of the stage. Behind the turntables, they mix their tributes and move the packed halls on a very fine sound. They also have the audacity to never run out of ideas, and in 2015 they offered their first revisit of a song from the 70s, Le temps est bon. A success.

Their album Aller-Retour concentrates their DNA: it is composed of revisited songs from the 60s and 70s and original productions mixed with interviews. All elegantly arranged in 14 tracks. Bon Entendeur creates sounds that are new, that go back and forth with their inventive digital generation and the immense heritage of their predecessors. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bon+Entendeur"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

166,166,katy perry,6126074,329450182,"Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson, known professionally as Katy Perry (born October 25, 1984 in Santa Barbara, CA) is an American singer, songwriter, and television judge. The story of who was born into a totally Christian environment and who years later would become a pop music star. Muse of those who feel different or excluded, Katy Perry got her first guitar (from the church) at the age of thirteen and dreamed of it, as many young people do. The difference is that she did it. She broke free from the shackles of faith (without ever losing it) and set out to live through songs about her experiences. The result? Aside from Michael Jackson, only she was able to place five songs from the same album at the top of the charts.

 After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name 'Katy Perry' and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.

Perry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, One of the Boys, a pop rock record containing the controversial U.S number one song ""I Kissed a Girl"" and ""Hot n Cold"". Three subsequent albums have topped the U.S. Billboard 200. The disco-influenced Teenage Dream (2010) spawned five chart-topping U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles–""California Gurls"", ""Teenage Dream"", ""Firework"", ""E.T."", and ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"" — a record tying her with Michael Jackson's ""Bad"". Its follow-up record Prism (2013) was inspired by her divorce, and incorporates pop and dance along with themes of self-reflection, everyday life, and relationships. With the music videos for its chart-topping songs ""Roar"" and ""Dark Horse"", Perry became the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on Vevo.  Her 2017 electropop album,  'Witness' featured a political subtext and a theme of liberation. Her sixth studio album 'Smile' followed in 2020.

Perry has nine U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one singles and has received various awards, including four Guinness World Records, five Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award. She has been included in the annual Forbes lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011 to 2019. Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. Perry is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 18 million albums and 125 million singles worldwide. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled ""Katy Perry: Part of Me"" in 2012, and voiced Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs and its sequel in 2013. Her Super Bowl halftime show performance is the most watched in history. Perry also began serving as a judge on American Idol in 2018. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

169,169,red velvet,1112176,196442080,"There are three artists who go by Red Velvet:
1) k-pop
2) Italian musician
3) future funk

1) Red Velvet (레드벨벳) is a five-member South Korean girl group formed by SM Entertainment in 2014. The group consists of Irene (아이린), Seulgi (슬기), Wendy (웬디), Joy (조이), and Yeri (예리). Their name is a play on their dual concept of ""red"" and ""velvet;"" the ""red"" half is their brighter and bubblier side, while their ""velvet"" image is their softer, more mature and elegant concept.

Debuting in 2014, Red Velvet was originally a four-member group. Three of the original four members of Red Velvet were previously part of S.M. Entertainment's pre-debut team, SM Rookies. Seulgi, the first member who joined the agency, was brought in through an audition in 2007. Irene, the next member to join the company, was cast in 2009. Joy, the member who wasn't part of SM Rookies, auditioned through the SM Global Audition in Seoul in 2012. As part of SM Rookies, several clips of Irene and Seulgi were released on S.M. Entertainment's official YouTube account. The three members were rumored to debut as a group in July 2014, which was then later confirmed by SM Entertainment. With the addition of member Joy, the four-member group would debut as Red Velvet - SM Entertainment's first girl group in five years, after f(x).

Red Velvet's debut single ""행복 (Happiness)"" was digitally released on August 4, 2014. The music video was released on August 1, and later become the second most viewed K-pop video worldwide in August 2014; on the same day, the group made their official debut stage on the music program Music Bank.

Red Velvet released their second digital single ""Be Natural"" on October 13, 2014. It is a remake of a song by veteran SM Entertainment girl group, S.E.S.. The track features Taeyong, former member of SM Rookies' male unit named SR14B, as well as a member of NCT. The group started their promotional activities for this release on October 9, making their first appearance on the music program, M! Countdown. The music video for the song was released on the same day.

On March 11, 2015, SM Entertainment released a video announcing the addition of a new member to the group's lineup—Yeri. On March 14, ""Automatic,"" the group's first music video featuring Yeri, was released. The following day, they released their first mini-album ""Ice Cream Cake"", along with the music video for ""Ice Cream Cake."" It was also announced by S.M. Entertainment that both ""Automatic"" and ""Ice Cream Cake"" would be promoted as double lead singles of the album. 

In early September 2015, S.M. Entertainment announced that the group would be making a comeback, and on September 9, 2015, Red Velvet released their first full length album ""The Red"". The album features ten tracks, including the title track, ""Dumb Dumb."" The album focuses on their ""red"" image, which is supposed to be the group's bright and bold side. On December 18, 2015, the group took part in S.M. Entertainment's special winter project, Winter Garden, alongside label-mates f(x) and BoA, releasing a digital single titled ""세가지 소원 (Wish Tree).""

While promoting ""The Red"", it was hinted at by the members and S.M. Entertainment that there would be a follow up album, but nothing was confirmed at that time. In March 2016, it was announced that the group would make a comeback with the group's second mini album. ""The Velvet"" was released on March 17, 2016 as a direct follow up to their first album ""The Red"". While ""The Red' focuses on the ""red"" half of the group's image, ""The Velvet' focuses on the group's smooth and soft ""velvet"" image. The title track, ""7월 7일 (One Of These Nights),"" is described as an R&B ballad. On March 27, 2016, the group performed the track on music show Inkigayo.

On September 7, 2016, Red Velvet released their third mini-album ""Russian Roulette"". The mini album features seven tracks, including the title track of the same name, ""러시안 룰렛 (Russian Roulette)"". On September 13, 2016, Red Velvet took their first music show win for ""Russian Roulette"" on The Show. The title track peaked at #2 on the Gaon Digital Chart and Billboard's World Digital Songs chart, making it their highest rankings on both charts at the time. On January 27, 2018, the music video for ""Russian Roulette"" became the group's first music video to reach 100 million views.

 A few months later in January of 2017, it was announced that the group would be releasing new music in February. The group's fourth mini-album ""Rookie"" was released on February 1, 2017.

All five tracks on the mini album debuted in the Top 50 of the Gaon Digital Chart.

Red Velvet revisited their ""velvet"" image by releasing their second full-length album ""Perfect Velvet"" on November 17, 2017 with the lead single ""Peek-a-Boo."" ""Peek-a-Boo"" peaked at #2 on Billboard's World Digital Songs chart. In South Korea, the album and the single ""Peek-a-Boo"" both charted at #2 on the Gaon Album Chart and Gaon Digital Chart. Through the release of Rookie, The Red Summer and Perfect Velvet all in the same year and the success of their albums overseas, Red Velvet achieved a ""top girl group"" status in South Korea in 2017. On January 29, 2018, Red Velvet released a repackage of their previous album titled ""The Perfect Red Velvet"", consisting of three new songs, including title track ""Bad Boy."" This was meant to be the most ""velvet"" track Red Velvet had ever put out.

On March 20, 2018, it was announced that Red Velvet would be performing alongside other selected South Korean artists for an inter-Korean concert in Pyongyang, North Korea. This makes them the first artist from SM Entertainment in fifteen years since Shinhwa to perform in North Korea.

The extended play debuted at #3 on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart and sold 26,124 copies on its first week of release in Japan.

On July 19, 2018, Red Velvet announced they would be making a comeback soon and had already filmed their music video outdoors in Gyeonggi-do. Excitement was stirred after the announcement of an English language version of previous single ""Bad Boy."" The songs from the new album were performed during Red Velvet's concert Redmare. They released their sixth extended play ""Summer Magic"" on August 6, 2018. The extended play contained seven tracks, including the title track ""Power Up"" and a bonus track of their popular song ""Bad Boy"" recorded in English. The album peaked at #1 on the Gaon Album Chart. 

After the release of ""Summer Magic"", news about Red Velvet's upcoming comeback circulated in October 2018, which SM Entertainment responded to by confirming a November comeback. SM Entertainment later revealed the details of the extended play along with the title of the lead single: ""RBB (Really Bad Boy)."" They also teased an English version of the title track to be added as a bonus track. RBB was released on November 30 as their seventh Korean extended play overall. 

On January 6, 2019, Red Velvet released their first Japanese digital single, titled ""Sappy."" The group released another Japanese single, ""Sayonara,"" on February 20. Both singles are included in their second Japanese EP, ""Sappy"", which was released on May 29; the EP also includes Japanese versions of ""Peek-a-Boo,"" ""Rookie,"" and ""Power Up,"" as well as a new song called ""Swimming Pool.""

In February, Red Velvet embarked on the North American leg of their Redmare Tour.

On April 5, Red Velvet were featured in a remixed version of ""Close to Me"" by Ellie Goulding and Diplo, with Yeri and Wendy contributing Korean lyrics to the song.

On June 19, Red Velvet released their sixth Korean EP, titled ""The ReVe Festival: Day 1"", which topped the Gaon Album Chart and features the lead single ""Zimzalabim.""

To promote The ReVe Festival, the group embarked on their third tour, La Rouge, which began in Seoul on November 23 and 24. The third and final entry of the trilogy, ""The ReVe Festival: Finale"" was a compilation of the previous two EPs and contained four new songs, including the chart-topping lead single ""Psycho."" This would be the group's latest comeback for over a year.

On July 6, 2020, the group's first sub-unit was formed. Red Velvet - Irene & Seulgi released their first mini album with ""Monster"" as the title track. The album also featured a solo song for the group's lead vocalist, Seulgi. On July 19, they dropped a single titled ""Naughty."" It was remixed soon afterwards.

On January 1, 2021, their company, SM Entertainment, hosted the Culture Humanity free online concert featuring many of their artists. Red Velvet returned as five after the member Wendy had been on hiatus for a year because of injuries and Irene had been absent for weeks due to controversy. The group preformed songs including ""Peek-a-Boo"" and ""Bad Boy."" The long-anticipated five-member performance of their hit track ""Psycho"" was also performed.

Before the group returned as five, Wendy was announced to be debuting as a solo artist. On April 5, 2021,  ""Like Water"" was released, which included two lead singles: ""Like Water"" and ""When This Rain Stops.""

Member Joy also debuted as a solo artist with a title track and remake album titled ""Hello"". It released on May 31, 2021.

The five-member group's long-anticipated 6th mini-album ""Queendom"" was released on August 17, 2021. The title track ""Queendom"" was described as ""a pop dance song with the message that we are all 'queens' of our lives, and that together we shine more beautifully.""

Their first release of 2022, ""Feel My Rhythm,"" was released on March 21, marking the return of The ReVe Festival. The mini album consisted of 6 songs, the title track sampling ""Aria on the G String."" The song effortlessly mixes elegant classical music with a modern, upbeat pop sound.

As the third member of the group to debut solo, Seulgi released her first EP  ""28 Reasons,"" on October 4, 2022, alongside the title track of the same name.

The group has been endlessly praised for their diverse concepts and uniqueness. In November 2019, Billboard crowned Red Velvet as ""the best idol group alive."" The group has now surpassed their tenth anniversary, and Red Velvet continues to captivate and gain recognition domestically and around the world from their fans, ReVeluv (레벨업), as well as casual listeners alike.

Kehlani's fourth album, Crash, was released on June 21, 2024, and featured collaborations with Jill Scott, Omah Lay and Young Miko.

180,180,jagger finn,499212,7542237,"Jagger Finn, a bedroom pop musician hailing from Los Angeles and based in New York, has been releasing music since 2015. Beyond his primary moniker, Jagger Finn has also released music as oakjoi and Finn Luca. Oakjoi is the URL of his Soundcloud account and Finn Luca seems to be what he used to share music under around 2017.

Jagger Finn's music is characterized by an indie sensibility, reflected not only in his sound but also in his enigmatic distribution method. Jagger Finn has cultivated an unconventional approach to music dissemination, which has sparked curiosity among his followers. Despite being a popular artist, his discography remains elusive and challenging to uncover. Only three songs remain on his Spotify, along with occasional Soundcloud reuploads.

Sacrificing the allure of financial gain and widespread recognition, he employs an obscure and transient mode of releasing audio files. This approach fosters an air of mystery around his complete discography, leaving enthusiasts guessing about the numerous tracks that might have slipped into obscurity under titles like ""v.7,"" ""019,"" and ""pollux8.""

The majority of Jagger Finn's work remains shrouded in enigma, often bearing cryptic titles that pose challenges for seekers. Employing numbers, dates, or even seemingly random phrases, his song titles contribute to the sense of hidden treasure. Certain tracks exhibit a sequential naming convention, necessitating the discernment of patterns to unveil the sequence.

Despite the unpredictable cadence of his releases, Jagger Finn consistently introduces new music. However, many of these releases are swiftly retracted, sometimes available for only a few hours. This intriguing practice intermittently leads to the rediscovery of his creations, which may resurface after months or even years.

The demo for ""Please"" was released on Halloween of 2015, signifying one of Jagger Finn's early contributions. A distinct project from this period is the 2016 album named ""disparu,"" released under an alternate alias. This album bears the hallmark of sample-rich lo-fi hip hop interwoven with a distinct jazz influence. Jagger Finn adeptly integrates vintage samples, contributing to the album's unique character.

Speculated to have been released between the years 2016 and 2018, an untitled album surfaced briefly before being removed. This work notably embraced an acoustic sound palette.

In January of 2018, Jagger Finn unveiled an album titled ""drafts"" on his now-inactive Bandcamp platform. One of his singles, ""Triplbt Theme,"" premiered on August 28, 2019, remaining as his sole Spotify release to date. ""Vas,"" recognized as his most prominent hit, has garnered over 235 million streams.

Amidst his catalog, Jagger Finn released the album ""Technoviolet"" in 2021; however, this offering was promptly retracted shortly after its release. The single ""violet"" made its debut on December 12, 2022, marking a recent addition to his musical repertoire. His latest release on Soundcloud, ""AUDIO 1214TEST3,"" was unveiled on December 20, 2022.

1) Kim Seok-jin was scouted by Big Hit Entertainment for his looks while walking down the street. At the time Kim was studying acting and had no background in music. On June 13, 2013, Kim made his debut as one of the four vocalists in BTS with their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool. Kim released his first co-produced track, a solo single from the album Wings titled ""Awake"", in 2016. The song peaked at number 31 on the Gaon Music Chart and six on the Billboard World Digital Singles Chart. In December 2016, he released a Christmas version of ""Awake"" on SoundCloud.

On August 9, 2018, the second solo by Kim, ""Epiphany"", was released as a trailer for BTS' then-upcoming compilation album Love Yourself: Answer. The song was described as a ""building pop-rock melody"" by Billboard and contains lyrics discussing self-acceptance and self-love.

He accepted and was then part of the Ruff Ryder family and his first album on the Ruff Ryder label.

Jin is also working on a project where he is planning on releasing a Cantonese album called ""ABC Jin"", where ABC stands for American Born Chinese. The album will be released internationally and ""ABC Jin"" will be rapped in all Cantonese.

Jin's style of rapping consists of strong punchlines, and used this skill in the battles he won. His punchlines hardly ever uses metaphors that require much thought to decipher, and his bars are clean cut and powerful when used in battles. Such battles against Verse, Shells, RK, and his 106 & Park battles are great examples of his style of rapping and battling.

187,187,alfa,52281,1190966,"There are several musicians with a name ""Alfa""

1. Alfa - a New York-based folk/pop/acoustic singer/songwriter and musician.

2. Alfa  - a trance artist.

3. AlFa - a post-rock duo from Strasbourg, France.

4. ALFA - a dreamwave/synth producer and artist, part of the Binary Collective from Los Angeles, California.

5. Alfa - a screamo band.

1. Alfa was born to a family that more than dabbled a bit in music. Some say she was born on a tree in the jungles of Mindanao, but those privvy to her life pre-cross-Pacific days know full well she was born in a tiny white hospital, and that she first learned piano from a strict Madame who would not let her exercise self-made renditions of “Mary Had a Little Lamb” during lessons. Her mother played the piano and the organ, her grandfather played the guitar by ear, her grandmother taught piano, and her aunts played the clarinet and the flute (they would soon become church organists, each married to pastors). Annoyed at what she saw as the norm, Alfa swore she would never become a musician. In fact, she first wanted to become a dentist.

Now 21, Alfa has relented to her musical fate. A singer/songstress since the age of 13, having cut her first demo at 15 and now a seasoned performer all over the venues of Manhattan (CBGBs, The Cutting Room, Arlene’s Grocery, Sidewalk Café, Rockwood Music Hall, Union Square, to name a few) Alfa has been around the figurative musical block with her start as a classical pianist under Dr. Raul Sunico, then a violinist in various orchestras including the Children’s Orchestra Society of H.T. Ma (Yo-Yo Ma’s pops), before finding her niche as a songwriter using a blend of her classical and church background and self-taught guitar and piano skillz (with a Z, heck yeah). At 17, she performed her song, ""I Believe"" with a full symphony orchestra at the Denver Center for Performing Arts and Lefrak Hall in Queens College under the direction of Michael Dadap. In addition to her extensive repertoire of ballads, laments, and pseudo-rock melodies, she has written music for plays, films and dabbled in acapella arrangements and performances with her childhood musician friends.

Alfa is inspired by everything: from first loves and intriguing faces, to the idiosyncracies of the number Pi. She is super thankful for the music and musicians that have perpetually surrounded her life, in spite of her initial disdain toward the sacred art. She will graduate Magna Cum Laude from NYU in May 2007 (finalement!). Alfa loves maps, New York City, ballet flats and Vera Wang perfume.

She has a four-song EP entitled ""Growth"" (currently available on iTunes), which she worked on with Dan Coutant at The Buddy Project thebuddyproject.com (Sufjan Stevens, Asthmatic Kitty).

Currently, she is working on a full length album with producer Alex Houton (who also produced Charlotte Sometimes), which will be full of new songs that will showcase her diverse tastes and talents in music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Alfa"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

189,189,vanessa paradis,530911,6297186,"
Vanessa Chantal Paradis (born December 22, 1972 in Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, France) is a French singer and actress.
 
She was discovered on the TV show L'École des fans in 1980. She recorded her first single La Magie des surprises-parties in 1985. Although it was not a hit, it paved the way for the song with which she would become internationally famous - ""Joe le taxi"" in 1987, while she was still only 14 years old. It was #1 in France for 11 weeks and, unusually for a song sung in French, was released in the United Kingdom the following year, where it reached #3. It was taken from her first album M&J (it stands for Marilyn & John) which, although it gained a number 13 placing in France, drew little attention in the UK and did not chart.
 
In 1992, now 19 and working in the United States with rock musician Lenny Kravitz, who was her boyfriend for a while, Paradis began work on a new album sung in English, in which she had become fluent. Written and produced by Kravitz, the album, titled Vanessa Paradis, topped the French chart and briefly made the UK listings (number 45). One of the singles from it was Be My Baby, which made number 5 in France and gave her another Top 10 UK hit (number 6). She has since appeared in several films, most famously ""Noce Blanche"", for which she won the 1990 César Award for Most Promising Actress; 1999's La fille sur le pont (aka Girl on the Bridge), which became an arthouse box office hit in the United States; and 2004's Mon Ange.
 
Paradis currently released a new album (Divinidylle). There are three versions (regular, limited edition, and the Christmas edition). She started the Divinidylle tour in October. Some concerts were filmed and the DVD/CD of the tour was just recently released. Her latest film DVD release is La Clef. Also, Vanessa recently won two Les Victoires de la Musique awards for her new album Divinidylle. Some of her next projects include a greatest hits cd which includes the commercial jingle ""I love Paris in the Springtime"" as well as the movies ""The Midwife Crisis"" and ""Un monstre à Paris April"" which will be released in 2010.
Vanessa Paradis has been in a relationship with American actor Johnny Depp since 1998. They have a daughter, Lily-Rose Melody Depp (born 27 May 1999), and a son, John Christopher ""Jack"" Depp III (born 9 April 2002[3]).

Her follow-up albums, Wounded Rhymes in 2011 and I Never Learn in 2014, showcased a more mature, emotionally charged sound, with Wounded Rhymes earning her two Swedish Grammy Awards for Artist of the Year and Album of the Year in 2012. Alongside her solo career, she collaborated with prominent artists like Kleerup and Röyksopp, lending her vocals to the tracks ""Until We Bleed,"" ""Miss It So Much,"" and ""Were You Ever Wanted.""

In 2016, Lykke Li co-founded the band LIV alongside members of Miike Snow and Peter Bjorn and John, further expanding her creative pursuits. Two years later, she released her fourth album, So Sad So Sexy (2018), marking a shift towards a more mainstream pop sound infused with late-2010s production influences. Her 2022 album, Eyeye, saw her return to a more introspective and sonically experimental approach, once again showcasing her characteristic blend of melancholic lyrics and innovative production. Over her career, Lykke Li has built a reputation for her sensuous, ethereal vocals and innovative musical style, solidifying her place as a significant figure in contemporary indie pop and electronic music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lykke+Li"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

193,193,duster,1271271,92656981,"Duster is a slowcore band from San Jose, California formed in 1996 with an initial lineup of Clay Parton and Canaan Amber, former members of bands Calm and Mohinder. They are known for their unique lo-fi sound, recording their music onto cassette decks and similar equipment at their home studio nicknamed Low Earth Orbit.

The duo released two demo tapes in the same year as their formation, Christmas Dust and On The Dodge. In 1997, they released their debut 7"" EP Transmission, Flux via Up Records.

The album was released by Up Records in February  1998, being followed by the Apex, Trance-Like 7"" EP via Smooth Lips Records that same year. By the release of the 1975 EP in 1999 and their second studio album Contemporary Movement, Albertini had become more involved in the group's creative process and became a permament member of the band. 

By 2000, Duster had become inactive and went on hiatus. In an interview, Clay Parton stated that ""When we originally paused around 2000, it was because of me. I went through a breakup, and I had a new baby, so I had to figure out to provide for this tiny person. A band was just not a priority anymore. So the other guys moved to Seattle, everyone was just kind of their own satellite for a while."" Duster had reconvened in 2004, expanding their lineup to include guitarist Krag and bassist Ross Peard. They announced that they had began working on new material, but were ultimately unsatisfied with the results and left it unfinished. The band had dissolved by 2005.

After Duster's dissolution, Albertini and Amber went on to form the experimental band Helvetia in 2005. Parton released his debut album Birds in the Ground under his solo alias Eiafuawn (short for ""Everything Is All Fucked Up And What Not"") the same year. Amber also released the self-titled EP Canaan Amber in 2010.

Duster announced their return on Instagram in 2018 with the simple message ""hi. it's been a long time but we are recording a little bit."" In January 2019, Numero Group announced Capsule Losing Contact, a boxset reissue of their complete discography, alongside unreleased material. The boxset was released in March. The band's first studio album in 19 years, the self-titled Duster, was released in December 2019 via Muddguts Records. 

In April 2022, the band surprise-released Together, their fourth studio album. Clay Parton announced via his forum Stereobird that ""jason is not a part of duster anymore and he's not on this record and no one should be reading anything at all into that because we all love each other still and forever..."", asking fans to also support Helvetia's recent output.

In 2023, Numero Group released Remote Echoes, an archival release compiling the band's widely-bootlegged demo material.

207,207,cordae,690903,19428544,"Cordae Amari Dunston (born August 26, 1997), known mononymously as Cordae (formerly known as YBN Cordae and Entendre is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. 

Dunston gained popularity by releasing remixes of popular songs, such as ""My Name Is"" by Eminem, and ""Old N***as"" which was a response to the song ""1985"" by J. Cole. Videos to both remixes were uploaded to the WorldStarHipHop's YouTube channel, which led to an immense and immediate positive response from both mainstream media and the online rap community. His debut studio album, The Lost Boy was released on July 26, 2019 and received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 62nd Grammy Awards. Cordae was a member of the YBN collective from 2018 until the group disbanded in 2020.

Dunston was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, but moved to Suitland, Maryland. As a young child, he'd taken an interest in music as his father would always play classic hip hop around him, from artists such as Rakim, Nas, Big L, and Talib Kweli. He began writing raps around the age of fifteen, but did not take it seriously, as it was only a hobby for him. Following the influence he gained from the music his father listened to, he would do research on certain artists through YouTube, attempting to find similar music and ""getting lost"" in the recommended videos section. Dunston began gaining more interest in pursuing a rap career as he aged, but focused on his education first, although writing lyrics often distracted him from his studies. He released three mixtapes as a teenager under the name ""Entendre"" – Anxiety (2014), I’m So Anxious (2016), and I’m So Anonymous (2017). He graduated from high school in 2015 and decided to go to college at Towson University, later dropping out in 2018, explaining that college was ""bigger than him"" as a first-generation student, and he was mainly doing it for his mother. He moved to Los Angeles shortly afterward.

Dunston began taking his rap career seriously in the beginning of 2018. Although he hadn't been releasing any music with them, he'd often hang around YBN Nahmir and Almighty Jay when visiting Los Angeles, whom he'd initially met through social media. Nahmir had taken interest in a song that Dunston had made with fellow rapper and brother Simba, and reached out to him. Dunston is the only member of YBN that hadn't been introduced to everyone as a gamer, as he doesn't take gaming too seriously. He already felt like he was a part of YBN, the only thing that hadn't solidified his presence being his social media handles, which he soon changed from Entendre to YBN Cordae. He also stated that Entendre had been a name that he'd wanted to change for while, stating ""I was just always around Nahmir and shit, those were just like my brothers... And, I was thinking, yo, I need to change my shit to like, Cordae, and shit, my actual first name. I was already ""YBN"" without the social tag, you know what I'm saying?"" He released his first single, which he called his ""introduction to the world"", in May 2018. It was a remix of the 1999 song ""My Name Is"" by Eminem, which he released along with a music video via WorldStarHipHop on YouTube. Subsequently, he released ""Old N***as"", as a response to ""1985"" by J. Cole, then released the tracks Fighting Temptations and Kung Fu, respectively.

His debut live performance was at the annual Rolling Loud music festival in May 2018, in which he performed with both YBN Nahmir and Almighty Jay. He performed with the duo again for the 2018 XXL Freshman Show in New York City, after Nahmir was announced to be an inductee of the yearly freshman class. Dunston was then announced to be joining Juice WRLD on his North American WRLD Domination tour from May to September 2018, along with Lil Mosey and  Blake, ended up reaching 28 cities. Soon after, it was announced that YBN would be going on a month-long tour in Europe as a collective. Dunston then said he would release multiple singles up until his debut project is complete. On August 2, 2018, both Nahmir and Cordae released a video for their single ""Pain Away"". On August 12, YBN Nahmir announced that an official YBN Mixtape, featuring the trio, would be released September 7, 2018. He released the music video for his single, ""Scotty Pippen"", on August 23, 2018.

On January 28, 2019, Cordae released a music video for a new song titled, ""Locationships"" on his YouTube channel before releasing another song titled, ""Have Mercy"" in March 2019, with the latter song becoming the lead single from his debut studio album, The Lost Boy. He was later named as one of the members of XXL's ""2019 Freshman Class"" on June 20, 2019.[26] Cordae later released ""Bad Idea"" and ""RNP"" as the second and third singles from the album respectively. The Lost Boy was released on July 26, 2019. The album landed YBN Cordae two nominations at the 62nd Grammy Awards; Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song for the single ""Bad Idea"". In November 2019, Cordae announced that he would be headlining ""The Lost Boy in America Tour"", which began in January 2020.

On August 6, 2020, YBN Nahmir took to Twitter to announce that the YBN collective officially disbanded. Cordae subsequently dropped the YBN from his stage name. On August 27, Cordae released a new single, ""Gifted"", featuring Roddy Ricch, marking Cordae's first release of 2020. Cordae has been currently working on his second album. During an interview with Apple Music, he stated, ""I'm like a hundred songs deep in. Like this next one, I'm really taking everything to a whole 'nother level. I really love doing music and perfecting my craft and I'm getting better every day.

214,214,damas gratis,71318,1111938,"Damas Gratis es un grupo musical de cumbia villera. Desde su salida, obtienen un éxito con su primer CD, al que titularon ""Para los pibes"", llevándolos a los mejores rankins de la cumbia en Argentina, Paraguay y Chile y popularizando el estilo de ""cumbia villera"" con el tema ""Se te ve la tanga"". Recientemente ya llegaron a presentarse en Mexico especialmente en Monterrey donde realizaron bailes masivos logrando en el auditorio coca cola un lleno impresionante de alrrededor de 20,000 personas y en el lugar de origen de la cumbia, Colombia, siendo el primer grupo argentino del genero de cumbia villera en trascender tanto internacionalmente.

La banda fue creada por Pablo Lescano. Anteriormente Pablo había integrado la prestigiosa banda Amar Azul en calidad de teclista. También fue el creador, el compositor y el alma del primer grupo de ""cumbia villera"" de Argentina Flor de Piedra, aunque no participó como músico en ella. Quién si lo hizo fue Romina Lescano, su hermana, que luego lo acompañó en Damas Gratis.

El estilo que empezó a asomar con Flor de Piedra alcanzó el máximo de profesionalismo con Damas Gratis. Hizo explosión y se consolidó en un indiscutible éxito relegando decenas de imitaciones a rol secundario.

Damas Gratis, sin letras románticas, melodías melosas ni carilindos colocó nuevamente a nuestra música tropical en los más variados sectores sociales, logro alcanzado por muy pocos grupos en la historia de la movida tropical.

La música y el ritmo de Damas Gratis continuó avanzando hasta trascender los límites de la música tropical, así lo reflejan diversos artículos publicados en diarios líderes en sus respectivos países como ser: Clarín, La Nación, El País, Buenos Aires Herald y revistas como Noticias o Rolling Stone, que también se ocuparon de este fenómeno que revolucionó la movida tropical y a la vez ubicó en los canales de televisión un rico debate alrededor de la cultura de las villas.


 Música de películas  [editar]Las melodías de Pablo Lescano siguen rompiendo fronteras culturales, ya que el filme del argentino Pablo Trapero ""El Bonaerense"", llegó a Francia al ""Festival de Cine de Cannes"" y su banda de sonido es de Pablo Lescano con ""Damas Gratis"". Este material es un símbolo además de la integración: una rareza para el “culto” como para el cumbiambero (banda de sonido ""El Bonaerense"").

Stella Rose Bennett was born and raised in the suburb of Grey Lynn in Auckland. She grew up in a ""really musical"" family with parents who would expose her to the catalogs of Radiohead, Björk, and Groove Armada. From the age of eight, BENEE began taking guitar lessons in primary school before starting saxophone lessons in high school. Eventually, BENEE dropped all music in order to prioritize water polo. She claims it ""was [her] life"" and that she at one point hoped to represent New Zealand competitively. BENEE later became interested in writing and recording music at the age of 17, after deciding that she did not want to pursue a career in water polo. BENEE attended an all-girls Catholic school, St. Mary's College, where music was compulsory for four years.

BENEE began her music career by posting covers to SoundCloud and began making her own music in her final year of high school. After dropping out of a communications degree at the Auckland University of Technology after two weeks, during what she called ""a quarter-life crisis"", she decided to enter the music business professionally. Her music caught the attention of Josh Fountain, a producer and member of the band Leisure, with whom she produced two singles: ""Tough Guy"", released in 2017, and ""Soaked"", released in 2018. she earned her first career entry on the Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2018 with ""Soaked"" at #58.

In both 2019 and 2020, she consecutively won Single of the Year, Best Solo Artist and Best Pop Artist at the New Zealand Music Awards. BENEE initially gained local prominence with her singles ""Glitter"" and ""Soaked"", before her 2019 single ""Supalonely"" saw international popularity following its success on the video-sharing platform TikTok and YouTube. BENEE subsequently released her debut album, Hey U X, in November 2020.

Under the moniker of Bene, she made her solo debut with the 2017 single ""Tough Guy"", before later gaining prominence with her 2018 single ""Soaked"", which has been certified double-platinum in New Zealand. She released her debut EP, Fire on Marzz, with help from producer Josh Fountain in June 2019. Her second EP, Stella & Steve, was released in November 2019 and charted in the US, Canada, and France as a result of the international success of the EP's final single, ""Supalonely"". Since 2018, BENEE has earned five entries on the Triple J Hottest 100, three of which were in the 2019 list. She also released her third EP, Lychee, in March 2022 which charted at number 13 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart.

In an interview for The New Zealand Herald, Benee revealed that she has dyslexia. She also described her childhood experiences with songwriting:

""throughout school I struggled with writing....I liked creative writing, that was what I loved, but I was always making mistakes, and I was confined to this way that I should write....Songwriting for me was this place where I don't have to be grammatically correct. Learning the craft with [Josh Fountain], when he was sharing all his knowledge – something clicked, and I was just like, I love this. It's a great emotional outlet for me; I just love splashing what I feel on to a track."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/benee"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

234,234,jacquees,472738,7829511,"
Rodriquez ""Jacquees"" Broadnax was born April 15, 1994 in Atlanta, GA. He found his passion for both singing and dancing at the age of 9 with influences from The Jackson's: An American Dream and The Temptations movies; imitating no less than the greatest. Jacquees participated in his first talent show in fifth grade at Canby Lane Elementary School performing the Jackson 5's, ""I Want You Back,"" winning 1st place. He successfully matriculated to Mary McCleod Bethune Middle School where he continued to compete in talent shows winning every year; two at Bethune Middle and one at the Dekalb County Middle School Talent Show. 

In 2007, Jacquees was introduced to his manager, Orlando Grind, by Dexx Lee. After years of performing in local talent shows, Orlando soon introduced him to Russell ""Block"" Spencer, founder and CEO of Block Entertainment. When Jacquees started going to the studio he merely blended with the team and wasn't given the opportunity to express his true talents. ""When you see work being done around you but not for you, you tend to get discouraged,"" says Jacquees. At that time, Block's focus was only rap, not R&B. It wasn't until summer of 2009 when Block witnessed how talented Jacquees was and shifted his vision. Jacquees began to work closely with Block Entertainment recording and gaining more exposure with the release of his first single ""Krazy"" featuring Grand Hustle's own, T.I. 

Jacquees has recorded with label mates, Gorilla Zoe and Scotty, T.I.P, and an upcoming Atlanta rapper, J-Real. Jacquees dreams to work with established artist Lil Wayne, Drake, Justin Bieber, Bow Wow, Lil' Chuckee, Chris Brown, and many more. ""All of these artists started out at the age I am and are successful in the industry. I look up to them and dream that I will be just as successful as they are,"" Jacquees explains. ""Only better!"" 

""It's truly a blessing to have the opportunity to work with the artist and producers I have already worked with,"" says Jacquees. ""I pray to God every night that I continue on this journey and achieve what I've always dreamed of doing. With God on my side, I know this is only the beginning and there is more to come."" With that in mind, Jacquees will achieve any and everything he wants out of the music industry.

255,255,radwimps,542780,29931504,"Radwimps is a Japanese rock band that formed in their first year of highschool in 2001 in Kanagawa, Japan. They play an eccentric mix of rock, punk, funk and jazz. The band achieved great commercial success in 2006 with their album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, and are best known for their later singles ""Order Made"" (2008) and ""Dada"" (2011), both of which hit number one on Oricon's single charts.

The five original members had been friends since middle school. Vocalist Yojiro Noda first became interested in music after hearing Oasis in middle school, when he would try to remember the guitar chords and sing to Oasis songs. He was asked to become the vocalist by a friend, and originally band activities were balanced with basketball. The band's name was formed from two English language slang terms, rad and wimp. According to the band, the coined word had several meanings, including ""excellent weakling"" and ""superlative coward.""

The band's activities began centred around Yokohama, with the band performing their first live at live house BB Street in Yokohama's Kannai district on February 5, 2002. At this point, guitarist Akira Kuwahara dropped out of high school in order to focus on the band. In September and August 2002, the band partook in the Yokohama High School Music Festival, and eventually won the grand prize for the competition with the song ""Moshi mo."" ""Moshi mo"" was released as the band's debut single in May 2003, with 10,000 copies pressed and sold for 100 yen each. Following this single, the band toured the Yokohama area, including a performance as the sole act at Yokohama's Club 24West. The band released their debut album Radwimps in July through independent label Newtraxx, featuring songs written by the band in middle school. The following August, after a guest appearance at the Yokohama High School Music Festival, the band went on hiatus for Noda and other members to focus on their school exams.

Radwimps returned from hiatus in March 2004, however members Kei Asō, Yūsuke Saiki and Akio Shibafumi did not decide to resume band activities. An audition was not held for new members, instead, acquaintances to the band members, drummer Satoshi Yamaguchi and bassist Yusuke Takeda, were added to the group without the members even having their skills trialled. Takeda met the band members in August 2003 as a member of a different band performing in the Yokohama High School Music Festival. The band immediately began recording songs, and by July released a second single, ""Kiseki,"" and performed a three month Japan-wide tour. Immediately after the end of the tour, the band started work on their second album, Radwimps 2: Hatten Tojō, which was finalized by the end of the year and released in March.

Directly after the release, the band departed on a five month tour, Radwimps Haruna Tour (はるなっTOUR?), and also performed at high profile summer music festivals, such as Setstock, Rock in Japan and Summer Sonic. During this time, the band released a third single, ""Hexun / Kanashi,"" which was the band's first charting release.

In November, the band made their major debut single under Toshiba EMI with the single ""Nijūgoko-me no Senshokutai,"" followed by ""EDP (Tonde Hi ni Iru Natsu no Kimi)"" in January, both top 50 singles. In shifting to a major label, Noda explained that the band took the same stance as they had as an independent band, and that ""If we thought we were bigger on a major label, that would have been a big mistake."" The band's third and first major label album, Radwimps 3: Mujintō ni Motte Ikiwasureta Ichimai in March 2006, was a landmark in establishing their popularity, debuting at number 13 on Oricon's album charts. Radwimps 3 saw a change in the band's musical style, allowing the band to be more experimental in their sound.

By the end of 2006 the band's popularity had exponentially grown: the band's album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, lead with the top 20 singles ""Futarigoto"" and ""Yūshinron"" and top five ""Setsuna Rensa,"" debuted at number five and had an initial shipment of more than 100,000 copies. In this time, the band's older releases, such as Radwimps, Radwimps 2 and ""Kiseki"" began charting for the first time and continued to for extended periods, Radwimps even eventually being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. In the next three years, both Radwimps and Radwimps 2 charted for approximately 100 weeks, and as of early 2011, Radwimps 3 and Radwimps 4 still continue to chart.

In 2008, the band received their first number one single, with ""Order Made"", on the Oricon charts. Their 2009 album Altocolony no Teiri sold around 213,000 copies in its first week, debuting at number 2 on the Oricon charts. The band received their second Oricon number one single ""Dada"" in 2011.

The band gained renewed notoriety in 2016 when they provided the soundtrack for the Makoto Shinkai film ""Kimi no Na wa. (Your Name.)"", which went on to become the highest-grossing anime film in history. One of the four vocal tracks, ""Zenzenzense"", was a #1 hit in Japan. The partnership continued when Radwimps provided the soundtrack for Shinkai's 2019 film ""Weathering With You"".

But the British-Australian songwriter—born Ruel Vincent van Dijk in 2002—has also been working at it for a sizable chunk of his life. Ruel was on the precipice of his teenage years when his dad sent a demo of him doing a James Bay tune to producer M-Phazes (Demi Lovato, Eminem) in 2015, kickstarting his run as one of 21st-century pop’s foremost purveyors of feels. His debut EP, 2018’s Ready, proved that he was exactly that—before even becoming a legal adult, Ruel built a record packed with well-crafted, R&B-inflected, chart-ready songs. The breezy rhythm of “Dazed & Confused” is juxtaposed with the heartbreak that staccato strings set front and centre for the throbbing chorus; and “Younger”, with its sugary vocal hooks, bouncy piano and gospel singers, softens the blow of a story about friends growing apart over time. In 2020, his music continued to mature with Bright Lights, Red Eyes. Using a stream-of-consciousness writing style, Ruel’s bedroom-pop vulnerability shines through on songs like the rousing “courage”, creating a tenderness and intimacy that’s impressive for an artist of any age. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ruel"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

265,265,davido,212606,3804133,"Davido (born David Adeleke) is a performing and recording artiste and also a music producer. Davido was born in Atlanta GA, USA on November 21st to Mr And Mrs Adeleke and attended The British International School, Lagos. Travelling between the USA, the UK and Nigeria, Davido has experienced different cultures but still stays true to his roots and this is evident in his music and the people he considers his biggest influences musically, which include Don Jazzy, 2 Face idibia, Sound Sultan and Wande Coal. Though Davido started music professionally a year ago, he has been performing and making music since the age of 11. Now 18, he has set up a record label called HKN Music, jointly ownedby Davido and Ade, his older brother. The saying “If you want something done, do it yourself” is what led the brothers start the label as Davido believes that as a producer and recording artiste, he would be in the best position to create music that suits his style. When asked to choose an ideal producer to work with, he responded “...myself, because I knowwhat I want exactly!” He is however quick to mention that he would definitely be excited to work with Sarz, Jaysleek and/or Don Jazzy.
In a short space of time, Davido has developed a huge fan base (14 to 28-year-olds) in Nigeria, the US and the UK and the young fresh talent’s first  single “Back When” featuring Naeto C, is enjoying massive media attention and airplay online, on radio and TV. In his own words, his greatest reward so far is “having my family and friends support my dream. I can’t ask God for more”. Within no time Davido took us by storm when he released Dami Duro , which has been said to be one of Nigerians top hits ever made. Without a doubt, Dami Duro has become a leading club song as well as one of radios most played.
Without wasting much time, Davido and his management team, in collaboration with Clarence Peters, put together a first-class, never seen before type video, to back up the banger, Dami Duro. Not only did this video create major buzz around websites, TV stations and youtube, but was also said to be one of the best videos out of Nigeria. Without saying much, it is evident that Davido is one to watch out for in 2012! He is evidently here to stay, and deliver.
Davido had a very eventful Christmas (2011) season performing all over Nigeria. He had amazing performances at shows like the Kokoconcert, Rhythm Unplugged, Echo 2011, Access Bank End of year Party and the Sahara End of year concert
The Artiste
Davido admits that his love for entertaining people comes from his late mother who passed away in 2003. Losing his mother has been the most traumatic experience Davido has had to suffer but it has also been his inspiration as he states “...she’s the reason I do what I do.... she loved to entertain and I plan on carrying that legacy...”
With collaborations with artistes likeNaeto C, Shank, Lynxxx and popular UK artiste, Dotstar, Davido is set to prove to the music industry that he has what it takes to succeed. He has also shared stages with people like T-Pain, Fabulous, Keith Sweat, Cabo Snoop, D'Banj, Naeto C and more.
The Producer
As a versatile artiste, Davido is able to adapt to any beat produced by other producers. However, this is a craft he has succeeded in mastering and with help from his brother Ade, HKN Studios would be a force to reckon with in the Nigerian Music scene.
Often asked where his inspiration as a producer comes from, David explains “... I like it when people are happy and when they can dance to my music! My mom liked to dance to music and I am inspired when I think of the kind of beats that would make her dance”
His debut single “Back When” featuring Naeto C is a testament to Davido’s ability and skill as a producer. He has also produced music for ... Naeto C, Skales, Tiwa Savage and Sauce Kid. So, the next time you are dancing to a well made beat, pay attention because you might just hear “on the beat its Davido”... A signature that will be heard on chart-topping songs for a very long time!
The Student
Often considered playful and fun loving, Davido has shown that he is a focused individual and not allowing his music career get in the way of his education. Davido is currently studying Business Administrations in Babcock University and he is applying things he learns in school into running the business of his music career. Ensuring that a proper system and business tools are in place for his music career, Davido hasnot only built a recording studio for the HKN Records, he has also assembled a management and PR team to help him run his affairs while he focuses on his education. Music doesn’t take a back seat though... Davido runs on a very tight schedule to ensure that neither his music nor education suffers!
The Brand
Good talent is hard to go unnoticed. However, more profitable than good talent is a good brand. The Davido brand is increasing growing and commanding attention. The good quality of the debut single “Back When” featuring Naeto C, produced by Davido, is complimented by the quality of the video shot by Award Winning Video Director, Clarence Peters.
The “Back When” video has over 100,000 views on youtube and has had massive airplay on MTV, SoundCity, 1 Music Channel and all Terrestrial TV stations.
Davido is probably one of the busiestof the new artistes in Nigeria as he has performed in some of the biggest shows this year. These shows include
The Music Meets Runway Show

Clan by Deola Sagoe

Three days after debut, the extended play 17 CARAT was digitally released along with the music video for their title track, called ""Adore U (아낀다)"". It was revealed that the extended play was mostly composed and produced by the members themselves.

2. Seventeen were an Indonesian pop group with a close fan following in eastern Asia. The band is perhaps best known for the 2008 tune ""Selalu Mengalah"", which came from Seventeen's third album Lelaki Hebat.

272,272,bohemia,18524,230620,"There are at least three artists with this name:

* The first is a Pakistani-American rapper:

Roger David (Punjabi: راجر ڈیوڈ), better known by his stage name Bohemia is a Pakistani-American rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer. Bohemia was born in Karachi, Sindh and received his education in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. At the age of 13, he moved to the United States with his family.

In his early teens, Ra (short for Raja) arrived with his family in America, settling in San Francisco’s Mission District. Within their first month on the block, Ra witnessed a young man get murdered over five dollars. The killer was the man’s brother in law. This would be Ra’s first lesson on trusting others in the streets of Pardes (the foreign land). Although he had strong knowledge and passion for writing music, he made it a second priority, and began hanging on the street corners to run drugs for local hustlers.

The streets became a priority to Ra, but he would occasionally play keyboards at local Desi events. Through this platform, he gained recognition in the Desi music community. But what struck people most was his ability to write songs or poetry, mostly in Urdu and Punjabi.

He was offered a lucrative job at a Sacramento based recording studio and he decided to follow his passion. Ra packed his bags and left his family behind to become a full time musician.

Along with a crew of other musicians, Ra was now spending his days on the road, playing gigs throughout the US and Canada, sleeping in cars and on recording studio floors. It would be through this experience that Ra would learn about stage presence.

As the youngest member of the musical family, Ra came to consider them his older brothers, but as certain members became entangled in hard drugs, the crew fell apart.
It was at this point that Ra, still a teenager, decided to go his separate way. Again, he packed his bags, this time to join his cousin in Oakland.

Oakland, CA. A city known for both it’s abundance of independent rap labels and it’s uncontrollable murder rate. Devastated by the loss of his friend and heavily influenced by his friends in Oakland, Ra began to loose focus on his music and indulge in heavy drugs, crime and women. He spent his days hanging in the streets and moving drugs across the 680 and 880 interstate.

Yet and still, Ra would be delivered an opportunity which would draw him back to his true passion. His cousin was working on a West Oakland recording studio, when he introduced him to a young hip hop producer called Sha One. Sha was in the process of setting up his own label. He was looking for an artist who had a strong presence both live and on record and he saw this in Ra. He flipped out when he heard Ra reciting something he’d written in Punjabi, and asked him to rap it over one of his beats. Ra has never rapped seriously before, but when he did, it was as if he’d found the perfect expressive medium for his writing.

Over the next few months, Ra wrote a library of lyrics. This would become arsenal for his debut album Vich Pardesan De (In The Foreign Land) – an autobiographical story of his life as a Desi youngster adopting to the streets of America. This album brought forth not only a voice for young Desis who were constantly balancing between Desi culture and American culture, but a new genre of music: Desi Rap.

* The second was a female-fronted Chicago punk band that had a local hit in 1980 with the ""Automatic Mind"" / ""Unconventional Boy"" single. It had a handful of later releases, including a sole LP, 1981's Deviations.

* The third was a Czech jazz rock / progressive rock band from the 70's:
 
In its time, Bohemia was to Czechoslovakia what UK was to the international prog scene - a supergroup formed by the cream of the crop Czech prog and fusion musicians. These included keyboardist Lesek Semelka (ex-Blue Effect), saxophonist Jan Kubik (ex-Flamengo), bassist Vladimir Kulhanek (ex-Flamengo) drummer Pavel Trnavsky (Jazz Q) and the 20 year old guitar prodigy Michal Pavlicek (ex-Expanze, later Prazsky Vyber & Stromboli). They grouped together in 1975. The leading figures in the band and the two main writers were Semelka and Kubik. There was something of a personality clash between them, as Semelka wanted the band to go in a pop direction (they also sometimes played as a backup band for pop acts), while Kubik had a more prog-oriented vision. Perhaps this is the reason for their ephemeral existence, yet in their measly three years they released a classic of Czech prog rock: Zrnko pisku. By this time the line-up was also expanded by keyboardists Michael Kocab and Jan Hala, and Jiri Tomek on percussion. This early association of Kocab and Pavlicek shows the roots of the 80's new wave legend, Prazsky Vyber. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bohemia"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
