Coming from different geographical locations, Madrid became their ""base"" of operations, which is why the name ""Madrid band"" has been highly honored since its inception, despite not being originally from the capital. Vitoria and Pamplona, Málaga and Henderson (Argentina), Valencia, Calamonte in Extremadura and Bilbao come together in a band with multiple references that have managed to create their own musical and conceptual personality.

Step by step, with 4 studio albums behind them (Magia y efectos especiales (2012), Agujeros de worm (2013), Copacabana (2015) and Autoterapia (2018), the band is positioned as the benchmark of the alternative scene and pop-rock from Spain, as the headliner at festivals as well as filling large arenas on their own tours, with the plus of having carried out a totally self-managed career from the beginning.

In autumn 2021, their fifth studio album, Hogar, was released independently, under the Hook Ediciones Musicales label and distributed by Altafonte. Hogar, an album of ten everyday stories told through photography, storytelling, video and song. Produced by IZAL, Brett Shaw (Foals, Florence and The Machine, Lady Gaga, etc.) and Sancho Gómez-Escolar, who dedicated the last months of 2020 to building ten new musical homes straddling the landscapes of the Tramontana mountains in Mallorca , the frenzy of the Madrid asphalt and the stubborn London rain. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Izal"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

5,5,ellie goulding,3346543,125561969,"Ellie Goulding (born Elena Jane Goulding, 30 December 1986 in Hereford, England) is an English singer-songwriter. Having caught the public's attention in 2010 with her singles ""Starry Eyed"" and ""Guns and Horses,"" British vocalist Ellie Goulding quickly rose to the top of the charts with her infectious electronic pop sound. Although she started out writing songs in a folk-inflected style, she eventually grew into a more electronic-influenced artist, touching upon dance music and ambient synth pop. With her unique soprano warble and knack for writing catchy yet emotionally earnest songs, Goulding, much like her predecessors Kate Bush and Imogen Heap, stands at the forefront of contemporary mainstream music and arty, independent-minded pop.

Born in Hereford, England, she later moved to the country's east coast to study drama at the University of Kent. Goulding had developed a love for folk music as a teenager, and her time at university also exposed her to electronica. After two years, she took a break from her studies and moved to West London, where she pursued a career as an alternative singer/songwriter and befriended producers like Starsmith and Frankmusik, who gave her songs an electro-pop twist. In 2009, Goulding began building an audience via the Internet, where early tracks like ""Starry Eyed"" and a cover of Sam Sparro's ""Black & Gold"" were posted on tastemaking MP3 blogs such as Discodust. Goulding soon graduated from the blogosphere to print media, gaining praise from mainstream publications like The Guardian and fielding offers from record labels. She ultimately signed a major-label deal with Polydor Records and began making preparations to release her debut album. In the meantime, she penned songs for Diana Vickers, Gabriella Climi, and others.

During the final weeks of 2009, Goulding topped the BBC's Sound of 2010, a poll conducted by British music critics and industry insiders to identify new talent. Building on that momentum, she released Lights -- a sparkling debut album that splashed Goulding's vocal flutter across a landscape of acoustic and synthesized instruments -- in March 2010. Lights topped the U.K. charts during its first week and spun off ""Starry Eyed"" as a Top Five single (it also charted well in Ireland and New Zealand). Later that year, the album was re-released as Bright Lights, featuring seven new recordings (including a cover of Elton John's ""Your Song,"" which peaked at number two).

In 2012, Goulding returned with her sophomore album, Halcyon, which showcased an even more sonically adventurous, electro-pop-infused sound. In 2013, a deluxe reissue featuring ten extra songs was released; entitled Halcyon Days, it acted as a supplement to the original release. Two of its new songs, ""Burn"" and ""How Long Will I Love You,"" were among her biggest hits. The following year, she was featured on Calvin Harris' Top Ten U.K. hit ""Outside,"" participated in Band Aid 30's update of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?,"" and entered the U.K. Top Ten once more with ""Beating Heart,"" a song released on the soundtrack for Divergent. Another soundtrack single, ""Love Me Like You Do,"" added to the success of Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015.

That same year, Goulding released her third studio album, Delirium, which featured collaborations with Max Martin, Greg Kurstin, and others. The pop-leaning Delirium included the single ""On My Mind"" and peaked at number three on the U.S. and U.K. charts. Goulding returned in 2017 on ""First Time,"" a collaboration with electronic producer Kygo.

In 2018, Goulding joined Tap Management after almost a decade with First Access Management.[107] She appeared on a collaboration with Sean Paul on his Mad Love the Prequel EP titled ""Bad Love"", released on 29 June 2018.[108]

Goulding collaborated with Diplo and Swae Lee on the single ""Close to Me"", which was released on 24 October 2018.[109] On 1 January 2019, The Guardian reported that she has been working on her fourth album, set to release in the same year.[110] On 1 March, she released the next single ""Flux"".[111] She said regarding the album, ""It's very much written by me"".[112]

On 12 April 2019, Goulding released the single ""Sixteen"".[113] Goulding said of the single, ""...That age was such a pivotal year for me in many ways and this song is so close to my heart. It takes me back to the reckless days of being a teenager and I hope it reminds us all about the innocence of youth.""[114]

Goulding released ""Hate Me"" with American rapper Juice Wrld on 26 June 2019.[115][116] It was premiered by Zane Lowe as his 'World Record' on Beats 1.[117] In July, Goulding stated that her next material to be released would be the songs ""Woman I Am"" and ""Start"".[118] In November, she released her rendition of Joni Mitchell's Christmas song ""River"", which topped the UK Singles Chart, becoming her third UK number one single and the last UK number one song of the 2010s.[119]

On 13 March 2020, Goulding released the new single ""Worry About Me"" which was created in-collaboration with Blackbear.[120] In a radio interview with Heart the same month, she revealed that the album ""kind of comes in two parts"", adding that ""the first side is something written entirely by me which was fun and I wrote most of it in New York when I was living there a few years back. I play the guitar and I play the bass and piano and then I'm singing a lot of vocals. It's very classically influenced because I love classical music. There's a lot going on, it's a big soundscape and one big film. The second half is my kind of alter ego songs.""[121] On 21 May she released single ""Power"" and on 30 June single ""Slow Grenade"" with Lauv.

Goulding released her fourth studio album, Brightest Blue, on 17 July 2020. Originally scheduled for 5 June 2020, the album's release was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album debuted at the top of the UK Album Chart, becoming Goulding's third album to do so,[122] as well as at No. 2 in Scotland.[123] It reached the top 10 in Ireland[124] as well as the top 40 in over ten countries including Australia, Germany and the United States.

Goulding announced on an Instagram Q&A that she would be releasing new music which was not part of the Brightest Blue era at the end of January 2021.[125] On 21 January, she released a collaboration with electronic duo Silk City, titled ""New Love"".[126] On 30 September, Goulding performed ""Anything Could Happen"" as part of the opening ceremony for Expo 2020, held in Dubai.[127]

On 19 June 2022, Goulding performed at Rock in Rio in Lisbon, Portugal. After the concert, she announced that she would be releasing new music in July. The following day, she blacked out all her social media profiles.[128] Back in July 2021, during an interview with Joe Wicks, she described the forthcoming album as ""a dance record. It's electronic pop, a dance thing from outer space"".[129] On 4 July 2022, she announced the release of ""Easy Lover"" featuring Big Sean, which was released on 15 July.[130] The single did not enter the UK Singles Top 100, but peaked at number 31 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart Top 100.[131] It was followed by ""All by Myself"", a collaboration between Goulding and producers Alok and Sigala, on 7 October.[132] Goulding released the single ""Let It Die"" along with its video on 19 October and announced the same day that her fifth studio album Higher Than Heaven would be released on 3 February 2023.[133][134]

14,14,dominic fike,1852767,101298087,"Dominic David Fike (Born December 30, 1995) is an American Singer and Alternative hip-hop artist from Naples, Florida. Fike first received recognition after releasing several popular songs on the website SoundCloud. Following the release of his debut EP, Don't Forget About Me, Demos, he signed to Columbia Records. Fike's song ""3 Nights"" reached the top ten in multiple countries. He later collaborated with the band BROCKHAMPTON and singer Halsey. In June 2020, Fike released the single ""Chicken Tenders"". In July of the same year, he released the single ""Politics & Violence"". Fike's debut album, What Could Possibly Go Wrong, was released the same month. The album charted in the top 50 in multiple countries, including the United States and Australia.

In September 2020, Fike became a headliner for a concert series in the video game Roblox. A few months later, NME included Fike on their list of essential new artists for 2020. He recorded a cover of Paul McCartney's song ""The Kiss of Venus"" for the album McCartney III Imagined. In 2022, Fike became a cast member of the second season of Euphoria in his first main acting role as Elliot.

Dominic David Fike was born on December 30, 1995, in Naples, Florida. Fike grew up with a younger brother, Alex, a sister, Apple, and an older brother, Sean, and is of African-American, Filipino, and Haitian descent. Fike went to Estero High School and graduated in 2014. Fike was a fan of Jack Johnson, Blink-182, and Red Hot Chili Peppers. He first acquired a guitar at the age of ten and learned how to play songs by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

During his childhood, Fike recalled that he and his brothers had to take care of each other owing to his parents' frequent absence from his life. Throughout his childhood, Fike’s mother was in and out of jail, causing him to stay in different homes, including those of his older brother, relatives, or his parents' friends. Fike's childhood life was ""full of adventure,"" as he and his friends would spend time in a forested area near their neighborhood that they called the ""Forest of Avalon,"" where he said they would eat snacks and smoke cannabis. He and his older brother Sean would also hang out at the guest house of his friend Stefan’s home, called the ""Backhouse,"" where they would freestyle. Later, they coalesced into a formal rap collective that included members Slyte, Ike Lysergic, and Seno. They attracted an audience in the community and Fike formed a sub-group called Lame Boys ENT. In 2015, the group started to attract the local media's attention and got booked into music festivals.

Fike started uploading songs on the Internet in high school and the first song he uploaded on YouTube was a song called ""Not A Word"". He also put songs he recorded into tapes. Fike briefly enrolled in a college but dropped out in less than 3 days.

Fike first received recognition by making beats with his then producer, Hunter Pfeiffer (known as 54) leading to several popular songs on SoundCloud being published. He released his debut EP at the age of 21 in December 2017 as an independent artist, which was recorded while he was on house arrest for the battery of a police officer. He later went to serve time at Collier County Jail for violating that house arrest. The EP caught the attention of several record labels and sparked a bidding war. After being released in April 2018, he signed with Columbia for a reported $4 million in August. All his previous work including the EP was pulled from all streaming services during the bidding war. Fike said the ultimate decision to join a record label was to pay for his mother's lawyer fee, who was facing drug charges at the time.

The EP was released again by Columbia on October 16, 2018. ""3 Nights"" was released as a single the same year. The single gained wide attention and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. It had an acoustic guitar sound compared to the music of Jack Johnson. It was placed on rotation on several radio stations and Spotify playlists and received favorable reviews from outlets such as Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, and Billboard. In reference to the EP, Billboard described Fike as a ""genre-meshing"" artist, and later named him a breakout act to watch, calling ""3 Nights"" a ""Motown-tinged breakout track"" that is ""trend-proof and irresistible"".

In January 2019, Fike revealed he was working on an album. On April 4, 2019, Brockhampton uploaded a video to their YouTube channel called ""This is Dominic Fike"" which included his song ""3 Nights"". As of April 2019, multiple collaborations with Brockhampton's Kevin Abstract have been posted, reaching over 4 million views.

On June 7, 2019, he released two singles, ""Açaí Bowl"" and ""Rollerblades"". He followed these with another single, ""Phone Numbers,"" produced by Kenny Beats, on July 4, 2019. The music video for this song was released on October 15, 2019. Fike announced on July 9, 2019, that he would be going on a tour titled Rain or Shine later in the year. The North American leg of the tour began August 31 in Philadelphia and ended October 3 in Los Angeles. In September 2019, he announced that he would be doing a clothing collaboration with Marc Jacobs. On the fifth day of that month, he performed a song that was unreleased at the time, Chicken Tenders, at a Chicago concert during his Rain or Shine tour.

Fike is featured on the track Dominic's Interlude on Halsey's third album, Manic, which was released on January 17, 2020. On June 26, 2020, Chicken Tenders, the first single from his then yet-to-be-named debut album, was released.

18,18,vacations,1467397,49610295,"There are multiple artists that perform under the name Vacations:

1. An alternative rock group based in Newcastle, Australia. Comprised of Campbell Burns, Jake Johnson, Nate Delizzotti and Joseph Van Lier. The pleasant sounds of the four piece  have earned them love at home and across the sea. Their music could be faithfully summarised as vibes, fitting somewhere in the shoeboxes of indie rock and glistening psych-pop. Their latest release (appropriately titled Vibes) features the tuneful croons of the singer Campbell Burns between shining, chorus-heavy guitars, bobbing bass and brushy jazz-rock drumming (worth a listen for fans of Morrissey and/or Mac Demarco). The band have just released a single that is the first taste of an album to come in 2018.

2. Members from Chin Up Chin Up formed a new band

Vacations was conceived while Bobby, Greg & Jeremy were wandering around Europe somewhere, on tour with their old band Chin Up Chin Up. They decided it’d be fun to try to start a new band without any guitar. The group they came up with is damn near the realization of that dream. They’re not completely devoid of or anti-guitar, but it certainly isn’t the heart of the matter anymore like it’s been for most of their musical lives. Ukulele, kalimba and karimba (those are both types of African thumb pianos – I just found that out from Wikipedia, too, it’s okay) are the sonic bread and butter for a band that has no real place on the map globally. 

In all honesty, Vacations is the sound of three guys making music who just don’t give a fuck anymore, and I mean that in the best of all possible ways. These three have spent years busting their asses trying to make it in music with their old bands (Chin Up, Make Believe, White Savage, Love of Everything, Hertzsprung Gap…) and making it just got old. Let’s face it. If it didn’t get old, they’d get pathetic. But letting go and quitting are two very different things. Vacations started as a way for the members to make music for themselves and leave the rat race (yes, I said it – the rat race of indie music. Trust me. It exists.) behind. They’ve brought back the whole reason they started making music in the first place: to make fun for themselves, their friends and hopefully their friends’ friends all over the place. It’s good-natured, revelry-inspiring, bizarro camaraderie in song. 

You can feel it from the first warm and plaintive notes of “I Was Bikini.” It’s something that instantly feels nostalgic and wistful for a good time you can’t even remember having anymore, but you’re pretty sure is still lingering in your bones or your blood-stream somewhere. It’s a feeling found in most of Vacations’ songs, propelled by familiar melodies made out of seemingly unidentifiable timbres and a winded heartbeat of rhythms. And when Jeremy and Chicago’s favorite chanteuse Jeanine O’Toole (of the 1900s) tell you that they’ll “see you on the other side,” you’re so wrapped up by the song that you don’t even question it. 

Vacations make a sound that, amidst all the buzzwords and hype-machines, serves to remind you that music is the ultimate meme. It is what you make it and how you choose to let people hear it. So staying true to what it once inherently meant to be an independent band, Vacations decided to forego what is now the obvious band routine. The pattern of “make an album, make someone put it out and make it sell” is not for them. They’ve retreated to the DIY-roots that abound in the songs they’re creating, but haven’t left the present tense behind. They brought it all back home. 

Their debut album is being released on Bobby’s own label, Record Label, instead of searching, shaking hands and hoping someone else will call it theirs. Yeah, I know. Nothing new. Greg Ginn and Ian MacKaye did it thirty years ago. That doesn’t make it any less admirable, though, especially in today’s oversaturated and over-funded transparency of a music scene. The real crazy and inspiring thing is, that their maiden voyage, I Was Bikini / But Rain Afraid, isn’t even really an album by any stretch of the contemporary terms.

Like I was saying earlier, I Was Bikini / But Rain Afraid is living in the present. An analog/digital choose-your-own adventure if you will. The vinyl enthusiasts can get their fix via the I Was Bikini 7”, a format that our economy’s coming dangerously close to making extinct despite the general vinyl renaissance. Yet, the best part is if you want the tangible, the time constraints of the disc don’t come into play anymore. Not only does the 7” come with a code to download the five songs on the record, but it also unlocks the album’s other eight songs housed on But Rain Afraid. Vacations aren’t vinyl elitists, though, nor are they classists. The whole of the album, all thirteen songs, will be made available from the band’s own web home for a pay-what-you-want-just-pay-something price. I know this is a lot to digest, but honestly, what could be better? You get to decide what Vacations’ music is worth to you and what it looks like. No questions asked.

In the end, this is open-endedness enables what the guys in Vacations really want. They want to engage you. They want you to listen to the story they’re spinning in notes and words. They want to make you part of the music they’re making and the fun they’re having. They’re getting back to the roots they never knew and they want to meet you somewhere in the middle of the expanse for the hang of a lifetime.  - Jesse Woghin

19,19,mgmt,4529525,170921826,"MGMT is an American alternative band which formed in 2002 in Middletown, Connecticut, United States. The band's founding members, Andrew VanWyngarden (lead vocalist, primary songwriter, multi-instrumentalist) and Ben Goldwasser (backing vocalist, multi-instrumentalist), met while attending Wesleyan University, and have remained as the core of the group to this day.

They intially named their project The Management, under which they recorded two demo EPs (which ended up being unofficially leaked online in 2005 as Climbing to New Lows), but changed their name to MGMT upon learning that another band had already been using their prior choice. Following this change, the band was signed to Cantora Records and released an EP entitled Time To Pretend - as VanWyngarden and Goldwasser had since graduated from Wesleyan, they gained the ability to tour more expansively in support of this release.

The duo was signed to Columbia Records in 2006, having caught the label's interest with their prior EP. They released their debut studio album, Oracular Spectacular the following year and quickly gained the attention of media journalists, other renowned musicians (such as Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney), and the general music industry alike. 

Their sophomore album, Congratulations, was released in 2010 and was notable for showcasing the band's matured sound, though this aspect made the album less appealing to much of their audience compared to their debut. Initially, the band had stated a desire not to release singles prior to the release of the album, but ended up making lead single ""Flash Delirium available on their website a month before the album's release. Due to the album having been leaked online, it was made available to stream for free on their website three weeks prior to its release date. 

In 2013, the band's third album, MGMT was released alongside an accompanying visualizer entitled ""The Optimizer"" meant to be played alongside the album. The album, which features a cover of the Faine Jade song ""Introspection"", continued the band's ongoing path of making more experimental music with heavier production - which subsequently meant that many critics found it even more confusing. The band took a brief break following the culmination of this album's promotional tour during which VanWyngard and Goldwasser focused on their own personal lives.

Having regrouped in late 2015, the band experienced what they referred to as ""writer's block"" which resulted in stagnancy within their recording sessions. After gaining a different perspective from their newly-hired producer Patrick Wimberly, however, the band decided for the first time to open their songwriting process and collaborate with other artists - in particular, VanWyngarden credited Ariel Pink for enabling him to feel more relaxed and open to a more spontaneous approach to songwriting. In 2018, the band released their fourth studio album, Little Dark Age, which showcased their return to a looser, more pop-like sound.

In 2019, the band parted ways with Columbia and began releasing music on their own independent label, beginning in December of that year with ""In The Afternoon"" followed by ""As You Move Through The World"" three months later. However, the band proceeded to go on an informal hiatus for the next four years.

The band announced in 2023 that they were planning to release a new album and go on tour again that year, and in October of that year they announced their fifth studio album, Loss Of Life, which ended up releasing in early 2024. The album features a much more contemporary sound in comparison to their prior releases, and includes their first-ever track featuring another artist, Dancing in Babylon (feat. Christine and the Queens).

Besides Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser, the band has included a number of touring members, some of whom also provided minor contribution to the band's studio recordings. These members include Hank Sullivant (guitar, keyboards), Matthew Asti (bass, backing vocals), James Richardson (drums, guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Will Berman (drums, percussion, harmonica, backing vocals), and Simon O'Connor (bass, backing vocals). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/MGMT"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

21,21,men i trust,1717203,86402801,"Men I Trust is Dragos, Emma, Jessy, Mathieu and Alexis. Founded in 2014, the indie dance band from Montreal, Canada loves smooth sounds, calm melodies and simple rhythms that relax, but make your right foot tap and your chin bounce on the beats. They record, mix, master and shoot their music videos. 

Jessy and Dragos knew each other since their fourth year of high school. Back then (mid-2000’s), Dragos had somewhat of a background in classical piano and Jessy mastered the dark and esoteric art of the metal guitar solist.

In 2012, while finishing his master’s degree in audio postproduction at Laval University, Dragos spent most of his days and sleeping hours at the “LARC” studio working on his solo projects. He randomly met Jessy again, who was finishing his bachelor degree in Jazz guitar, in one of the faculty’s hallways and talked about doing a French-Touch / Italo-Disco track together. Some weeks later, they did just that. And it worked out so well that they decided to extend their collaboration to a whole project where many singers such as Odile Marmet-Rochefort, Gabrielle Shonk, Helena Deland and Geoffroy Sauvé, would be involved.

Between 2012 and 2016, all of Jessy’s and Dragos’ releases were made as part of Dragos’ masters and (dropped) PhD studies in order to gain access to the LARC’s infrastructure and to develop a unique sound.


Emma was a fortuitous encounter. In 2015 a mutual friend presented her to Dragos through a video posted over the Internet. She was casually singing and playing the guitar around a campfire with some of her friends. Emma’s voice was different, being less clear, more grainy and fragile with a mysterious twist that caught their attention. They reached her and tried recording one song called “Out in myself”, which turned to be one of the band’s easiest to record.

Jessy and Dragos then invited her to join them on live shows with Odile at the beginning of 2015. The womans' voices blended wonderfully together and the band got lots of positive feedback from the experience. Emma has been part of Men I Trust since then.

With their second album “Headroom"", Men I Trust truly became a trio. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Men+I+Trust"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Carrera

Wos arrancó desde muy pequeño rapeando en las plazas y participando en competencias como El Quinto Escalón, donde ya demostraba un gran potencial y sobre todo mucho coraje. Pero fue en 2016 cuando demostró que su nivel estaba para mucho más que una plaza, ganando así varias fechas del Quinto Escalón, tirando acotes memorables, que se viralizaron mucho en las redes sociales y salió campeón de la fecha final, dejando en el camino a Dtoke en la primera ronda y derrotando en la final a Klan. Wos es uno de los que más veces logró ganar la competencia de El Quinto Escalón.

En el 2017 participó en la Final Nacional Red Bull Batalla de los Gallos por primera vez, donde salió campeón derrotando, entre otros, a Papo, uno de los candidatos en los Cuartos de final y a Klan en la final y así se clasificó a la Internacional que se llevó a cabo en México en la cual quedó segundo detrás de Aczino.

También participó en otras competencias como la Double AA que ganaría en Argentina. En la Red Bull Batalla de los Gallos Internacional 2018 se coronó campeón. En FMS Argentina 2018 Wos también salió victorioso después de ganarle en la final a Papo. También tuvo un papel protagonista en la película Las Vegas dirigida por Juan Villegas.

Actualmente en 2019 anunció su retiro de la FMS para desviar su atención a su carrera musical, sin embargo seguirá activo en otras competencias, como por ejemplo GodLevel, en la cual represento a Argentina junto a Papo y Trueno en la que quedaron subcampeones, y la final internacional de Red Bull 2019.

26,26,lord huron,1854161,51198537,"Lord Huron are an American alternative rock band founded by Ben Schneider, a Michigan-born visual arts major. 

Origins:
In the spring of 2010 Schneider traveled from Los Angeles to Northern Michigan. At Lake Huron, he developed songs for the first Lord Huron EP. He named the recording, Into the Sun. Upon his return to L.A., Schneider set to work putting a band together. The first to join him was his percussion-playing childhood friend Mark. Each of the band members of band hail from Michigan.

Into The Sun and Mighty
Lord Huron released two EPs in 2010, Into the Sun and Mighty. Pop & Hiss, the LA Times Music Blog, described Mighty as ""full of lush acoustic guitars and Midwestern-accented harmonies as warm as a winter fireplace, but it's the Caribbean-influenced percussion that fans Lord Huron's folk sound into flame,""and Pitchfork could only classify it as ""a stylistic superball, bouncing off any wall you put around it."" NPR's World Cafe wrote ""the band's lush harmonies are backed by a hazy whirlpool of polyrhythmic tropical drums and folk guitars.""
Despite the fact that Schneider played all of the instruments on both EPs, he has gathered a band for live performances, which have also gotten positive reviews. ""The totality of the experience was like being on hand for a combination drum circle, chamber performance, and Calypso street party,"" wrote LA Weekly.Some of the larger shows the band has performed at include Lollapalooza (2011) and Outside Lands (2011), as well as a marathon ten shows in four days at the SXSW (2011) music festival.

It wasn’t until four years later that Jordan called Marc to lend vocals to some demos, which were intended as a placeholder. As with the best of accidents, the two liked what they heard and Neil Frances was born.

Jordan grew up in Sydney, then spent time in London, before landing in Los Angeles. Marc, a California native, grew up outside of Los Angeles in Rancho Cucamonga, in a house across the street from his aunt, uncle and cousin. Since childhood, the two found themselves exposed to a range of music, from opera, disco, hip-hop and more, all of which informs their songwriting today.

These influences can be heard on Neil Frances’ dreamy debut EP, Took A While, consisting of five lustrous, reverberating dance tracks featuring one infectious melody after the other. Their sound caught the attention of Jungle and Poolside, who they toured with earlier this year. When the music discovery platform, The Wild Honey Pie first heard their music, they quickly invited them to play the launch of their Los Angeles dinner party series (held in early November) at Checker Hall. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Frances"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Currently a trio with Egor Shkutko on vocal duties, Roman Komogortsev on guitar, synths, and drum machine, and Pavel Kozlov on bass and synths. The trio have been dubbed “the Belarusian New Order of our generation”, but that’s not quite right – they have far more in common with the gloomy nihilism of that band’s forebearer, Joy Division, a bleak, claustrophobic quality that’s like sinking into a pool of tar. Formed in 2017, in their hometown of Minsk, the trio take inspiration from early 80s post-punk and new wave, a visceral, intense mix of metallic drums, ominous synths, and melancholic bass lines. Some tracks sound like they were conceived using basic Casio keyboard presets; others borrow from Krautrock’s motoric grooves. But all burn with a deep seated despair and frustration, Yegor Shkutko’s vocals sounding anguished and distant. The sparse, cold production of second album Etazhi also sounds oddly futuristic, the crushing soundtrack to some dank, cyberpunk dystopia.Their second LP, Этажи (pronounced Etazhi, meaning “Floors”) was released in 2018 on Berlin-based Detriti Records. It has sold out four times and is currently on its fifth repressing due to outstanding demand. Этажи has garnered over one million views on Youtube.

Born in the small town of Englewood New Jersey, he relocated to the cultural melting pot of Toronto at a young age, and grew up surrounded by music ranging from jazz to rock and roll to rap, dancehall and r&b. He began playing guitar and piano in high school.

At 17, he relocated to Montreal, QC to attend university, and began working in nightclubs cleaning tables and DJing. He started writing music at this time, incorporating the unique blend of sounds he grew up surrounded by. He started experimenting with music production and rapping in 2013, and dropped out of school to relocate to Los Angeles and pursue music full time.

Adopting the Grandson moniker while living in LA, he dove deeply into rock influences such as Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana, and Led Zeppelin, while also listening to rap/R&B music emerging out of Toronto and alternative acts such as Twenty One Pilots and Hiatus Kaiyote. He found a small community of musicians to work and perform with here in Los Angeles. The live tries to create a frantic, mosh pit-inducing cathartic release of energy for concert-goers, influenced by early punk and grunge music.

Searching for his voice and for meaning in today’s divisive, chaotic world, Grandson confronts the most pressing issues of his generation through his songwriting, such as financial inequality, governmental and environmental accountability, and social justice, giving these topics a soundtrack with a genuine sense of urgency and frustration.

36,36,jungle,1360986,42282992,"There are several artists using the moniker 'Jungle'.

1.  Jungle is an English modern soul musical collective founded by childhood friends, Tom McFarland and Josh Lloyd-Watson.
 Jungle was formed at the beginning of 2013, choosing to put an aesthetic emphasis on the music’s surrounding artwork and videos, and not on the pairs' own identity, (McFarland and Lloyd-Watson came to be known as J and T). Throughout the following year Jungle developed its nature as a collective by working with different artists across diverse disciplines. To perform the music live, Jungle expanded to a seven-piece band, fronted by J and T. Their debut album Jungle was released through XL Recordings on 14 July 2014.  The album was met with great critical acclaim and was later shortlisted for the 2014 Mercury Prize. Their 2nd album, For Ever, was released on 14 September 2018.



2. Based in Ann Arbor, Michigan – “Jungle” is a world/rock/fusion power trio featuring Steve ""Muruga"" Booker on drums, Dave Sharp on bass, and Steven Springer on guitar. “Jungle” was formed in 2010 when Muruga, Dave, and Steven collaborated on a project at Muruga’s ""Sage Ct."" recording studio. While in studio they recorded their first album “Jungle.” Drawing from many influences like Coltrane, Hendrix, Funkadelic etc. they recorded the album live.

Steven ""Muruga"" Booker, born in Detroit, MI, is a world renowned drummer and percussionist with musical roots going back to the late 1950's when he played in the Detroit rock n roll band “The Low Rocks.” Muruga was inspired by the blues, rock, and soul of the Detroit scene. He played with the legendary bluesman John Lee Hooker. They were booked as Hooker and Booker. Muruga is also known for his drum solos at venues like the East Town and Chessmate in Detroit. Playing with many artists throughout his career some highlights include playing Woodstock in 1969 with Tim Hardin, performing at Carnegie Hall with Dave Brubeck, playing on Weather Reports “Sweet Nighter” in 1973, and collaborating with George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars from the late 70's to the present. In 1990 Muruga released the billboard charting album ""Blues from the Rainforest"" with Merl Saunders and Jerry Garcia. In 1991 he was a recipient of th Hiroshima Voices for Peace award. He is featured on the Chesky Records album ""Circle of Drums"" with Babatunde Olatunji and Sikiru Adepoju. Most recently Muruga has released several albums on the Italian label Qbico Records and his 2010 release ""Kiss of Peace"" is nominated for 2010 Detroit Music Award for outstanding world music recording.

Steven Springer grew up in Port of Spain, Trinidad and is an accomplished, soulful songwriter and innovative finger style guitarist, with his roots in reggae, soca and calypso. His unique musical style is a melting pot of jazz, reggae, Latin, blues, rock and R&B, which combine to form a refreshing exceptional sound. When watching Springer perform, audiences from around the world have been witnessed an artist delivering his music with energy, conviction and raw emotion. Born in Trinidad, in the West Indies, Steven Springer was inspired by the melodic lilting sound of soca and calypso. He started playing guitar at a young age. Steven was intrigued by the fusion of many cultures and the beautiful natural features of Trinidad. In his early twenties, Steven moved to Phoenix, Arizona and formed a band called Sanctuary. Touring worldwide, Springer was a featured artist at the 1988 World’s Fair in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, performing with the Trinidad Calypso Band. Upon returning to the United States, Springer joined Hugh Borde’s world famous Trinidad Tripoli Steel Band, performing and recording with them for over ten years. Currently, Steven also leads the band Tropicooljazz. Among other numerous awards and honors, Steven was chosen “Best Guitar Player,” every year from 1990 to 1993, at the annual Detroit Music Awards.

Dave Sharp, a native Detroiter, became devoted to jazz at the University of Michigan and gained his chops under the tutelage of renowned bassist Herbie Lewis (McCoy Tyner, Cannonball Adderly and Les McCann) in San Francisco, and virtuoso bassist, composer and bandleader Marion Hayden (Straight Ahead) in Detroit. As bassist and composer for the modern jazz ensemble “Spheres of In uence,” and touring bassist for the seminal rock band “The Melvins” (Atlantic Records), Sharp has already made a mark on the national scene. He lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan where he composes, records, teaches and performs with Jungle has his own band Dave Sharp's Secret Seven.



3.Nothing is known about this excellent late sixties album's makers. A reissue is now available, so you can hear how good it is for yourself! Early Morning Rising, Slave Ship, House Of Rooms and Gray Picnic are all loaded with nice guitar and organ, even frantic (if somewhat inept) drumming on occasion. The tracks have an atmospheric, open quality and the recording is superb. This is a lost gem. The reissue has a deluxe embossed cover. It was originally issued in a plain sleeve.

41,41,tom misch,681498,17816974,"“Apparently, I have a sound , and people can hear it,” Tom Misch claims modestly. For someone with a cohesive and sprawling body of mellow beats behind him, he seems mildly bewildered that this is the case. “I try so many genres that it’s hard sometimes to pinpoint. I guess my sound is uplifting, soulful, funky — and happy more than it is sad.” It’s a perfect description of his debut album, due in 2018, which brings together low-slung hip-hop beats, glittering disco, and noodling jazz instrumentation in a way only Misch can.

If Misch seems surprised, it’s because his fanbase has developed naturally. He never set out with any grand plan when he began making beats, and uploading roughly three tracks a week to Soundcloud at 16. “ I prefer a more organic approach to making music, but also to building a fanbase,” he reflects. “I don’t want a big push on my music as I don’t want to be as big as possible.” And yet, he’s rapidly become one of the U.K.’s most exciting emerging new artists, gaining 1.1 million monthly listeners on Spotify and playing a sold-out tour of the U.K., U.S. and Europe in 2016. Collaborating with a clutch of fellow trailblazers like Novelist, Loyle Carner, and Zak Abel, he’s accumulated a total of 75 million streams across all platforms to date — and it all started in his bedroom.

Misch’s earliest introduction to music came via his artistic family, including his psychiatrist father, a passionate violinist, who would take him to concerts and the opera as a child. He sang in a choir at school, and picked up the violin himself at the age of four. When one of his older sisters took up guitar and later abandoned it, nine-year-old Misch inherited the instrument, and taught himself to play Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Nirvana songs. Today, he also plays bass, banjo, and a smattering of keys.

It was one of his sister’s boyfriends who introduced him to the music of J Dilla at 15, and from then on, Misch was hooked. He took up Music Technology at school the following year, and began learning how to create his own “really chilled out, boom-bap kind of ‘90s hip-hop” on Logic Pro. “When I wasn’t at school, I’d be making beats,” he says. “It was just what I did.” As he began sharing his tunes on Soundcloud, he found the response was overwhelming. “You put songs out and you build a fanbase — it’s kind of addictive.”

A collaboration with his sister Laura, on the jazz-inflected “Follow,” was a major turning point for both siblings after it was uploaded to influencer YouTube channel Majestic Casual. The track features Laura on sax and Tom on beats and vocals, intertwined to mesmeric effect. “That was the point where I was like, okay, maybe I could do this as a career,” Misch reflects. “Suddenly it had 100,000 plays.” Shortly afterward, Soulection co-founder Joe Kay commented on one of Misch’s productions on Soundcloud, asking the teenage prodigy to guest on his radio show.

Soon afterward, in 2014, Misch contributed to Soulection’s White Label series, weaving together obscure jazz samples, guitar, and vocals to create the perfect summer listen (including the dreamy fan favourite “The Journey”). His Beat Tape series collected the best of his hip-hop instrumentals, the 5 Day Mischon project featured collaborations with grime MC Novelist and singer-songwriter Zak Abel, and his 2016 Reverie EP brought the official release of Misch’s most sophisticated songs to date. As well as soulful singers Carmody and Jordan Rakei, he struck up a collaborative relationship with fellow south Londoner Loyle Carner, whose mellow bars flow over Misch’s productions like a breeze on a hot day. Both artists form part of the much-hyped scene of singer-songwriters emerging from south east London, including King Krule and Cosmo Pyke. Each has a DIY mindset and a brooding, poetic approach to lyricism that weaves them loosely together. “There’s definitely a certain sound,” reflects Misch. “Everyone’s music in south London is really chilled. It reflects the vibe of this part of London — it’s laid back.”

Misch has lived in south London all his life, and he loves it so much that his new single, “South of the River,” is dedicated to it. “I much prefer the general vibe of south London,” he says. “I love this area, Peckham, Dulwich, Forest Hill. Singing that line — You should come south of the river — it just felt really good.” With its string arrangements mirroring disco synth stabs and a funky bassline, it’s an irresistible bop that nods clearly to Misch’s danceable new direction.

One of the biggest influences on Misch’s sound has long been jazz. With a degree in jazz guitar, Misch is an avid listener of Robert Glasper, Roy Hargrove, Cory Henry, and jazz-influenced songwriters like D’Angelo and Erykah Badu. “It’s kind of a warm feeling, when you hear a certain chord progression,” he explains.

In the making of his debut album, he’s also been drawing on inspiration from disco, house, and techno, discovered through the portal of producers like Kaytranada and Motor City Drum Ensemble. The euphoric feel of 1970s and ‘80s disco (think Earth Wind and Fire or Gwen McCrae), and the thump of nightclubs like Fabric or Corsica, inspired him to bring more movement into his songs. “I want people to dance at my live shows, I want to bring more energy,” he says. “When you’re in a club and you can feel the bass...I want people to have that experience.”

Misch’s sound is true to its roots — he still makes his tracks in the same bedroom studio in his parents’ house, and his mum produces his artwork. (“ Her work is very DIY, just like my music, and feels homespun,” he explains.) But he’s never afraid to explore new territory. “I think it’s really important to make music that hasn’t been made before,” he says. “I’m trying to work out what my sound is, and pursuing that.” Fans might think they know his style, but Misch is a restless experimentalist, keen to spend endless hours honing his craft. One of his favorite new songs is a “Brazilian-sounding” jam that reflects how deeply he feels about his work. As he puts it: “It’s about how you can’t take away my love for music. I’ll always have that.” <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Misch"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

49,49,leisure,409913,5319495,"There are five artists with the name Leisure:

1) LEISURE is a band from New Zealand that launched on SoundCloud in 2015 with 'Got It Bad.'  https://soundcloud.com/theleisurecollective

Made up of five independently talented and successful members who were looking for a new creative outlet unconstrained by over-thinking, over-planning, and excessive control; LEISURE are an anomaly in the music industry. This unusual melting-pot of contributions means LEISURE is greater than the sum of its parts, each member bringing different influences from 70s funk, to 90s rap and R&B, all the way to dance music from the early 2000s. Each member also brings a different skill set – strong pop song writing sensibilities, experimental production techniques, and the talent to mix and master their own work.

Having amassed over 60 million streams on their debut album, which entered at #2 in the NZ charts, they have built a rabid fan following that has seen their very occasional live shows sell out and become the stuff of legends – recently performing their debut, backed by the 72-piece Auckland Philharmonic Orchestra, to a sold-out Auckland Town Hall.

Their music has become a staple in the sync world, they have collaborated with hip-hop star, Goldlink, and have now signed globally to US / UK record label Nettwerk for their forthcoming album.

Their self-titled debut album release was critically acclaimed and with their sophomore album complete, fans worldwide continue to connect with their manifesto of living the good life, and their over-riding code to “keep things LEISURE”.

2) Leisure is a band from Boston, MA consisting of Jed Rouhana, Sam Hamad, and Chris Link. The three members played in bands together since High School. In 2010, they gave a demo CD to JR White of the San Francisco band Girls, during one of Girls' Boston shows. The CD included ""It's Alright (On The Suez Canal)"". White subsequently invited Leisure to open on their US tour. After touring, Leisure began work on their debut album ""Plastic Soul"", which they self-produced. The album is set to be released in 2012. More information can be found on their official website,www.leisureofficial.com and facebook page, www.facebook.com/leisuremusic

3) Leisure featured Middle Class Rut hitmakers Zack Lopez and Sean Stockham and a rotating cast of singers. The earliest incarnation of the band, which included D. Scott Sault, who would later front the short-lived Atlantic Records act Quitter, self-released an EP, Polygraph Alliance, in 1999. After Sault's departure the band briefly included Die Trying (Island) frontman Jassen Jensen. The band eventually landed a deal with Dreamworks, then fronted by Darren, and, shortly thereafter, at least briefly, ex-Hotwire frontman Rus Martin stepped in. The band's one and only national tour was opening for CKY. No word on if an album was ever completed, though several demos, some more impressive (""Deathtrap"") than others, do exist. 

4) Leisure was formed 1998 in New York City. They play non-Britpop and sing about faith, hope and love. Drew sings/play guitar, Peter plays keys/sings, Steve plays bass and Ted plays guitar/sings. They had recorded 2 EP’s (Occasional Music 1.0 & 2.0) with SoundOptik (Ryan Adams, The Strokes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion), Jesse Sprinkle (Poor Old Lu, Serene UK, Starflyer 59) and Andrew D. Prickett (The Violet Burning, Cush, The Prayer Chain). Their music can be heard on XM Satellite Radio.

5) Leisure is still a young band but has some experience however. Formed in November 2004 with the idea of playing only covers. In view of the result of exalting rehearsals, the band decided quickly, under the impulse of Francois, the bands songwriter, to create a set entirely made of their own compositions. The band chose clearly its style, under the British influence and sensitive to each decade (from The Beatles, the Kinks to The Libertines as well as Oasis). Leisure is made up of five members : a drummer with a heavy strike (Nessim, 23), a bassist who gives a certain feminine touch to the band (Coralie, 19), a rhythmical thorough guitarist (Nicolas, 22), a soloist gifted guitarist (Francois, 21) and a charismatic singer (Siamack, 20). The year 2005 has meant toil for the band, accumulating compositions and hours of intensive rehearsals. The band performed at that time in the main venues of Bordeaux, like lInca, lAssonette, la Centrale and some open air gigs like the participation to the festival « Tête de lArt ». At the end of the year, Leisure recorded his first demo called « Shoots in the Streets », recorded and mixed by Kim, produced by the band itself and containing five of their songs played live. The year 2006 is promising for the band which had the honor to play in renowned places such as lHeretic et le SonArt, still improving their set on stage and their compositions. They were also broadcasted several times on radios, like Radio Sauvagine (94.9 FM). After having had the ambition to be known in Bordeaux, the band thinks of exporting itself little by little in whole France. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Leisure"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

50,50,rainbow kitten surprise,841384,30762916,"Rainbow Kitten Surprise and all five of its members hail from the mountains of Boone, North Carolina. With catchy, yet deep lyrical meaning, beautifully designed bass lines, and melodic guitar riffs, their unique sound will keep you humming their tunes all day long. The Alternative/Indie-Pop band takes influence from great artists like Modest Mouse, Lana Del Rey, and Kings of Leon.

RKS was formed in early 2013 when the first two members, Ela Melo and Darrick ""Bozzy"" Keller, decided to begin writing and composing music together. What started out as just two college students with acoustic guitars, would soon turn into a full band with a uniquely controversial name.

After recording RKS's first EP ""Mary"" in an old dorm room on the campus of Appalachian State University, the duo decided to take it up a notch by adding more members and instruments to the band. Over the next year the group widely expanded in size and sound by adding three more members: Ethan Goodpaster (Electric Guitar), Jess Haney (Drums), and Charlie Holt (Bass). In that year, RKS independently released their first album ""Seven"" (Which was later re-released in combination with the band's first EP as a joint album titled ""Seven + Mary""). The title song, ""Seven"" has been featured in many places on the web including in the very popular podcast by IGN, Podcast Beyond! The song ""Devil Like Me"" and its music video earned the band a spot in VH1's ""Make A Band Famous"" contest where they made it to the final 24 out of thousands of artists from across the US.

The group's main interest is producing a quality, unique, and fresh sound for all music lovers to listen to and enjoy. Their new album ""RKS!

The band is named after its lead singer María Zardoya, who was born in Puerto Rico and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. She and her partner Josh Conway, the drummer, met at a show at the Kibitz Room, the bar and music venue inside Canter's Deli in Los Angeles. She was performing on the bill and he was managing the sound, something he had never done before. They began writing almost immediately after meeting and subsequently began dating. Soon they recruited close friends to join as band members: Edward James on keyboards, and guitarist Jesse Perlman.

53,53,ray lamontagne,1393766,24901872,"Raymond Charles Jack LaMontagne (born June 18, 1973) is an American songwriter, singer and musician. LaMontagne has released eight studio albums, Trouble, Till the Sun Turns Black, Gossip in the Grain, God Willin' & the Creek Don't Rise, Supernova, Ouroboros, Part of the Light, and Monovision. He was born in New Hampshire and was inspired to create music after hearing an album by Stephen Stills. Critics have compared LaMontagne's music to that of Otis Redding, The Band, Van Morrison, Nick Drake and Tim Buckley.

Early life
LaMontagne was born in Nashua, New Hampshire, in 1973, one of six children raised by his mother. In his early teens he lived in Morgan, Utah, and was more interested in drawing images of Dungeons & Dragons than in his school work. After graduating from high school, LaMontagne moved to Lewiston, Maine, and found work in a shoe factory. LaMontagne also spent a significant amount of time in Wilton, Maine. Other sources state that by his teen years he was living in Maine, spending time in Turner and Buckfield.

Style
LaMontagne has a unique vocal style which he says is created by singing through his gut instead of through his nose. He cites Stephen Stills, Richard Manuel, and Rick Danko as strong musical influences while critics have compared LaMontagne's music to that of The Band, Van Morrison, Nick Drake, and Tim Buckley.[failed verification] A Rolling Stone review of his album Supernova referred to his voice as an ""impeccably weathered tenor croon"" and his phrasing as ""marble-mouthed.""

Awards
For his debut album, LaMontagne won four awards, including three Boston Music Awards (Best Male Singer-Songwriter, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year) and an XM Nation Music Award for Acoustic Rock Artist of the Year. LaMontagne has received a nomination from the Pollstar Concert Industry Awards for Best New Touring Artist, the BRIT Awards for International Breakthrough Act, the MOJO Awards for Best New Act, and was given the title of Best Voice in 2006 by Esquire.

In 2011, Ray LaMontagne and the Pariah Dogs received two Grammy Award nominations, and they were awarded the Grammy for the Best Contemporary Folk Album for God Willin' & the Creek Don't Rise.

Controversy
On July 23, 2014, during a show at the Meijer Gardens in Grand Rapids, Michigan, LaMontagne interrupted a song and walked off stage as a result of two fans talking during his concert, after having previously asked the audience to quiet down. The incident included yelling profanity at the couple before walking off stage. Once the couple was escorted away LaMontagne continued the concert.

On September 20, 2016, LaMontagne announced that he was canceling a September 22 show at the Bass Concert Hall at the University of Texas at Austin, due to Texas's recently implemented campus carry law.

Personal life
In 2009, LaMontagne paid $1.05 million for a 103-acre farm in Ashfield, Massachusetts, the former residence of U.S. Ambassador William C. Bullitt, where he lives with his wife, Sarah Sousa, and their two children in the farmhouse built in 1830. Sousa is a published poet via Red Mountain Press and their sons are budding artists.

56,56,old sea brigade,259147,2333031,"The nom de plume of Atlanta, Georgia-raised, Nashville-based singer/songwriter Ben Cramer, Old Sea Brigade emerged in 2016 with a critically lauded EP that featured a compelling, heartfelt, and atmospheric blend of folk, country, Americana, and indie rock that invoked names like Bon Iver, Iron and Wine, and the National. A string of singles and an EP for the Nettwerk label paved the way for his 2019 full-length debut, Ode to a Friend.

After several years playing in bands around the Atlanta area, Cramer decided to forge ahead as a solo act, adopting the Old Sea Brigade name in 2015. Self-released in 2016, his eponymous debut EP earned him enough buzz to land key support slots for Hiss Golden Messenger, Julien Baker, and Benjamin Francis Leftwich during his first U.S. tour. Later that year, he inked a deal with Nettwerk and began work on a follow-up release. Cramer's first single for Nettwerk, the rousing ""All the Same,"" dropped in September 2016 and was later included on 2017's Wash Me Away, the first of three EPs he would issue that year. The song ""Tidal Wave,"" from his next EP, Cover My Own, notched significant play on streaming networks. Cramer closed out a banner year with the Christmas EP Songs for the Holidays.

58,58,manchester orchestra,1313638,38484938,"Manchester Orchestra is an American indie rock band which formed in Atlanta, Georgia in 2004. The group is currently composed of rhythm guitarist, singer/songwriter Andy Hull, lead guitarist Robert McDowell, keyboardist and percussionist Chris Freeman, bassist Jonathan Corley and drummer Tim Very. Former drummer Jeremiah Edmond parted ways with the band in January 2010 to focus on his family as well as running the band's record label, Favorite Gentlemen. 

Manchester Orchestra has released several extended plays and six studio albums: I'm Like A Virgin Losing A Child (2006), Mean Everything to Nothing (2009), Simple Math (2011), Cope (2014) (as well as its accompanying acoustic version, Hope), A Black Mile To The Surface (2017), and  The Million Masks of God (2021). They are signed to independent record label Favorite Gentlemen Recordings, which is distributed through Sony Music Entertainment, and Loma Vista Recordings. 

Manchester Orchestra originated in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. They are named after the English city Manchester, a place rich in musical history (The Smiths, The Stone Roses, Joy Division, Oasis, New Order, Happy Mondays). Feeling increasingly alienated at his ""small-town-Georgia, Christian high school"", Hull became so frustrated that he spent his senior year studying at home. Early in their career, the band recorded an album entitled Nobody Sings Anymore. However, it was never released due to the shift in the band's musical direction and personal changes undergone following its recording. The band stated that ""the band that made the record was different to the band now."" Some of the tracks written for the album were released instead on the EP You Brainstorm, I Brainstorm, but Brilliance Needs a Good Editor.

Following  You Brainstorm, I Brainstorm, but Brilliance Needs a Good Editor, Manchester Orchestra recorded and released their debut album I'm Like a Virgin Losing a Child. This album gained the attention of the music industry, and eventually led to their signing with Canvasback. The album was released nationwide July 27, 2007. Guitarist Robert McDowell did not appear on this album. The song Wolves At Night was featured in the video game NHL 08.

In October of 2008 the band recorded their second EP, Let My Pride Be What's Left Behind, with producer Dan Hannon and engineer Brad Fisher. It was released October 7, 2008.

In early September 2008, the band announced on their Myspace blog that they had begun recording their second album entitled Mean Everything to Nothing with producer Joe Chicarrelli (The Shins, My Morning Jacket). On February 4, 2009, the band posted a link to a free download of the single I've Got Friends and performed an acoustic version at The Fly’s In The Courtyard Sessions. The album was released April 21, 2009.

On January 26, 2010, the band released a digital split EP with Kevin Devine entitled I Could Be The Only One. Following the release of the Manchester Orchestra/Kevin Devine split EP, it was announced that Kevin Devine would record a full-length album along with the members of Manchester Orchestra later that year, with half the album written by Devine and half by Andy Hull. On April 10, 2010, it was announced the new project's name was Bad Books, and that the album would be released under that moniker, and not ""Manchester Orchestra + Kevin Devine"" as previously speculated. The self-titled full-length Bad Books album was digitally released on October 19, 2010, and on CD on November 9, 2010.

On March 2010, in an interview with the Dallas Observer, Hull mentioned that the band had begun work on a follow up to 2009's Mean Everything to Nothing tentatively entitled Let Go of Your Sorrowful Groaning. He also said that the band have around 34 songs they are demoing and that in writing this album he was imagining a ""spiritual miscarriage"". Later that year in an interview with Rip It Up magazine, the band announced that they were in the middle of recording their third full-length album. Although without a title, they explained that the album was completely different to anything they had released in the past. The album was being recorded with Dan Hannon and balanced between Blackbird Studios (Nashville, TN) and their own Favorite Gentlemen Studios (Atlanta, GA).

On October 23, 2010, during an appearance at Radio 104.5 in Philadelphia, following a Bad Books show in support of their recently released self-titled debut album, Manchester Orchestra debuted an acoustic version of the title track of their new album, Simple Math. Originally scheduled for release in March 2011, the band announced in January of 2011 that their third full-length studio album, Simple Math, would be released on May 10, 2011, as well as announcing the album's tracklist and revealing that the album was set to be a concept album.

59,59,maribou state,536495,11426213,"Maribou State is Chris Davids and Liam Ivory from Hertfordshire. Liam asked Chris to play bass for his band. When they moved up north to go to university, the band fell by the wayside and the pair began making electronic music in their home studio, forging a partnership that would soon become Maribou State.

In the summer of 2011 they were scouted by Fat! Records and put out their debut release, the 'Olivia' EP, which set a blueprint for Maribou State's trademark bass-heavy, melodic sound. Grassroots support for the duo was also building. When they brought out a bootleg of Lauryn Hill's 'Doo Wop' (produced in collaboration with Pedestrian), the tune racked up thousands of plays on YouTube and got airtime on Radio 1, 1Xtra and XFM courtesy of Diplo, B. Traits and Eddy Temple Morris respectively.

Their first project for Southern Fried was a remix of 'Hummus' by Crookers, which hit the top of the Hype Machine chart during the spring of 2012. Then the 'Native' EP dropped in June and one of the tracks from it, 'The Look', was promptly given 10/10 and awarded Tune Of The Month by Mixmag. Along with underground fans, key tastemakers were beginning to take note.

Momentum continued when, after a summer spent playing shows, the next single for Southern Fried was released. 'Scarlett Groove' (featuring Saint Saviour) was a certified off-kilter pop hit, notching up radio play from Annie Mac and Lauren Laverne as well as being given Essential Tune status by Pete Tong. It was an excellent way to round off 2012, a year made all the nicer when Maribou State's remix of Ultraista's 'Gold Dayzz' went viral, plonking the pair at the top of the Hype Machine chart once again and hitting over 200,000 plays on SoundCloud.

Their first major release of this year was another collaboration with Pedestrian. Signed by Polish house duo Catz 'N Dogz and put out via their Pets imprint, 'Mask' pushed Maribou State firmly to the fore of the British scene, running alongside Disclosure, Bondax and AlunaGeorge as artists dedicated to making accessible yet highly inventive dance music. The record also gained further radio play from Zane Lowe, Hugh Stephens and Rob Da Bank, as well as long-time supporters Annie Mac, B. Traits and Pete Tong.

As 2013 began to unfurl, Chris and Liam will release their latest single for Southern Fried, a record that marks the next stage of their career. A double-A side including 'Tongue' and 'Larks Rise', it sees them realise their vision of creating organic dance music in the same kind of way as Bonobo and Four Tet, forging field recordings and live instrumentation with broken house rhythms and waves of sub-bass.

61,61,flora cash,463972,5452928,"Flora Cash is a Swedish–American musical partnership consisting of Shpresa Lleshaj and Cole Randall. The pair work primarily in music but also collaborate in other fields under that moniker. 

Lleshaj, an Albanian originally from Kosovo, whose family fled to Sweden while she was a child to escape war and conflict in the region, was living in Stockholm when she met Randall, from Minneapolis, on SoundCloud in 2012. Lleshaj began commenting on the tracks Randall had posted and the two discovered they appreciated each other's music. After meeting in person in Minneapolis, they began working together in Sweden as Flora Cash. The duo has said that they've never revealed the origin or meaning of their band name to anyone.

In 2012, the pair met on SoundCloud and struck up a musical connection, leading Shpresa Lleshaj to travel from Stockholm to Minneapolis to meet Cole Randall in person. They returned to Sweden together and immediately began work as Flora Cash. 

They released their debut EP, Mighty Fine, on December 12, 2012. Their second EP, Made It for You, came out on June 13, 2013. That year, Lleshaj and Randall also married. A third EP, I Will Be There, followed on September 20, 2014.

After independently releasing a handful of songs and two EPs, the pair signed with Swedish label Icons Creating Evil Art, after which they released, Can Summer Love Last Forever?, in March 2016. The seven-song mini-LP earned them nominations for two GAFFA awards, as Swedish Artist of the Year and Swedish Newcomer of the Year.

Flora Cash broke into the mainstream with their song “You’re Somebody Else”; a track from their debut full-length album, Nothing Lasts Forever (And It’s Fine), which Steve Baltin, writing for Forbes Magazine called “arguably the most intriguing song on radio this past year.”. The song reached #1 on Alternative Radio and achieved RIAA Platinum Certification in the United States.

The duo performed several times on American television after making their debut on The Late Late Show with James Corden and toured with Sir Sly, Joywave, lovelytheband, Judah & the Lion and AJR throughout 2018 and 2019.

Between Second's second and third album Pose (2003) and Invisible (2006), the attention to the band increased as Second won the Global Battle of the Bands contest in London in 2004.
The band was signed to Warner Music.
 Between 2011 and 2018, Second had five albums in the top 15 of the Spanish Albums Chart. Demasiado soñadores (2011) reached 12th, 15 (2012) reached 15th, Montaña rusa (2013) reached 11th—the two latter remained on the charts for five weeks each.

65,65,vansire,1436274,31245916,"Vansire is a dream pop band from Rochester, Minnesota consisting of Josh Augustin and Sam Winemiller. They are currently signed to Spirit Goth Records. Vansire has performed at ROCKChester and First Avenue, played a live session with Audiotree, and collaborated with artists such as Chester Watson, Jeremiah Jae, and Mick Jenkins.

Vansire formed as band members Josh Augustin (vocals, synths, guitar, and drums) and Sam Winemiller (bass, guitar, and synths) were attending Century High School in Rochester, Minnesota. Augustin and Winemiller met while playing together on the school's drumline and continued to find themselves performing together through school activities (such as concert band and pit orchestra), something the duo says contributed to their creative synergy and friendship, which later helped in Vansire's formation.

In the summer of 2015, Winemiller approached Augustin after practice for the school's drumline with an idea to make a band ""that sounds like Mac [DeMarco]"". The pair's early recordings were made by holding instruments to the internal microphone of an iPad running GarageBand. Augustin and Winemiller, initially unsure of what to call their new project, turned to an online random word generator that landed on ""vansire"", an alternative name for the Marsh mongoose. From there, the two continued to record together in their basements, living rooms, and bedrooms under the new Vansire moniker.

In August 2016, Vansire self-released their first album, ""Reflections and Reveries"". The duo recorded the album entirely in Winemiller's basement in a roughly one-year period from August 2015 to August 2016, and included Winemiller's brother, Issac, on bass for some songs.

During this time, Augustin began studying at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and Oberlin College, while Winemiller started at the University of Minnesota. Despite the distance, the duo vowed to remain committed to the Vansire project, now describing it as ""a long-distance band relationship.""

Vansire released their second album Angel Youth in April 2018 on Spirit Goth Records. Augustin and Winemiller produced and mastered the album themselves, and it is the band's first full-length album that featured collaborations with other artists.

In June 2019, the duo released their single ""Metamodernity"", also recording an Audiotree Live session at Audiotree's studios in Chicago later that August.

In July 2020, Vansire released ""Central Time"", a single featuring Chicago-based rapper Mick Jenkins in their first collaboration together. In an interview announcing the single, Augustin said the single began as an instrumental demo that Winemiller sent him in September 2019, which sat untouched for roughly eight months until the duo returned back to it, finishing it up at the beginning of June 2020.

During this period of the band's history, Augustin said that Vansire found itself leaning in an ""increasingly dance-oriented direction"" with regard to musical sound and that the duo has started to draw influence from more ""dancey, funk-imbued music"".

On October 16, 2020, Vansire released ""After Fillmore County"", a seven-song EP that brought back FLOOR CRY, and featured Philadelphia-based rapper Ivy Sole. In April 2021, Vansire released a remix of Sydney-based producer-artist Swaine Delgado's ""F Me Up"", their first remix. In May 2022, Vansire released their third LP, The Modern Western World"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Vansire"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

67,67,fleet foxes,2288141,103383555,"Fleet Foxes is an American indie folk band formed in Seattle, Washington in 2006. The band consists of Robin Pecknold (vocals, guitar), Skyler Skjelset (guitar, mandolin, backing vocals), Casey Wescott (keyboards, mandolin, backing vocals), Christian Wargo (bass, guitar, backing vocals) and Morgan Henderson (upright bass, guitar, woodwinds, violin, percussion, saxophone).

Led by singer-songwriter Robin Pecknold, the band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP Sun Giant and their debut album Fleet Foxes on Sub Pop. Both received critical praise and reviewers often noted the band's use of refined lyrics and vocal harmonies. Fleet Foxes' second studio album Helplessness Blues was released on Sub Pop in 2011. Following a hiatus between 2013 and 2016, during which Pecknold pursued an undergraduate degree, Fleet Foxes reunited to record their third album, Crack-Up, released on Nonesuch Records in 2017. The band's fourth album, Shore, was released on Anti- in September 2020.

Formation and early years (2005–06)
Robin Pecknold and Skyler Skjelset both attended Lake Washington High School in Kirkland, a suburb of Seattle, and soon became close friends. Pecknold and Skjelset bonded over an appreciation of Bob Dylan and Neil Young and began making music together. Their parents influenced their musical tastes early on—Skjelset's mother Peggi was a keen listener to both Dylan and Hank Williams while Pecknold's father Greg was a member of The Fathoms, a local 1960s soul group. The two shared an interest in the music of Dylan and Brian Wilson. Pecknold played bass for Seattle's Dolour on a US tour in 2005, shortly before forming the first incarnation of Fleet Foxes.

Originally going by the name ""The Pineapples"", a name clash with another local band prompted a change and Pecknold decided upon ""Fleet Foxes"", suggesting that it was ""evocative of some weird English activity like fox hunting"". Pecknold took up the role of principal songwriter, both singing and playing guitar, while Skjelset played lead guitar. The original lineup was filled out by Casey Wescott on keyboards and backing vocals, Bryn Lumsden on bass and Nicholas Peterson on drums and backing vocals.

Pecknold's late-sixties pop style caught the attention of the Seattle producer Phil Ek and he helped them record their first demo in 2006, the self-released Fleet Foxes EP. Ek was impressed with the band's songwriting, and on hearing Pecknold for the first time, noted, ""It was obvious he had talent coming out of his ass."" By late 2006 the Seattle press began to take notice of the band; Tom Scanlon of the Seattle Times stated that he was impressed with the band's lyrics and musical maturity. By the end of the year, Lumsden had been replaced on bass by Craig Curran, who would also handle many of the band's vocal harmonies.

With growing popularity on the local circuit, the band set about making their first album in early 2007, spending time in the studio with producer Ek in addition to recording material at home. However, funds for recording were tight, so the band members cobbled together what funds they had, which limited the time they had in the studio, and so the majority of the tracks were recorded in various band members' apartments, other spaces, or the basement of Pecknold's parents' house.

Sun Giant and Fleet Foxes (2007–08)
Fleet Foxes were becoming increasingly popular and by late 2007, they had attracted over a quarter of a million song plays over two months on their Myspace site. Although the band had not released any of their recordings, they benefited from word of mouth exposure and their success soon translated into a record deal, signing with Warner Music subsidiary record label Sub Pop on January 18, 2008. According to Sub Pop's A&R, Sue Busch, at the time of signing the band was still a relatively primitive set-up, being without manager or legal representation. Robin's sister Aja Pecknold then assumed the role of band manager. The band's frontman, Robin Pecknold, attributes much of their success and popularity to illegal file sharing.

The band tracked their second EP, Sun Giant, at Bear Creek Studio and performed overdubs and mixed at Seattle's Avast! Recording Co., around the same time in preparation for upcoming tours. Fleet Foxes began their spring tour with another Northwest band Blitzen Trapper on February 28, 2008. Before the recording of the EP, bassist Curran was replaced by Christian Wargo, whose voice, like that of his predecessor, would become an important part of the band's harmony blend. The band's performances, first at the SXSW festival in March 2008, and then the Sasquatch! festival in May 2008, moved the band into the public consciousness, notably attracting attention from the European press for the first time.

Sun Giant was released internationally on April 8, 2008 and the group's brand of folk, rock and pop, marked by their use of vocal harmonies, was well received by the press. Despite the warm critical reception, the group said that the EP did not represent their full ambitions, serving merely as a CD to sell while on tour. In May 2008, the band chose to extend their North American and European tour until September in support of their forthcoming album. At this time Josh Tillman replaced Peterson on drums and backing vocals. Their first full-length album, Fleet Foxes, was released shortly afterwards on June 3, 2008. The album achieved similar critical success as the previous EP. Fleet Foxes received four out of five stars from Rolling Stone, which compared it to the likes of the Beach Boys, Animal Collective, and Crosby, Stills & Nash, and a 9.0 out of 10 in a review by Pitchfork Media, sharing the website's album of the year rank with the Sun Giant EP. The Guardian was particularly complimentary, awarding the album five stars and declaring it ""a landmark in American music — an instant classic"". On June 24, 2008, Fleet Foxes went to No. 1 on the CMJ Radio 200 Chart. The album achieved an average rating of 87/100 from 30 critic reviews on the aggregator website Metacritic.

While the group enjoyed moderate success in the United States, Fleet Foxes was better received in Europe, selling over 200,000 copies in the five months following its release. The sales were matched with critical plaudits and their debut album won Uncut's first ever Music Award 2008 prize. Uncut's editor, Allan Jones, said the album ""showed impeccable musicianship, and although you could trace its antecedents, it sounded totally unique. Fleet Foxes was just a glorious debut."" The band sold out music venues for their tours of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, reaffirming their growing popularity.

At the end of 2008, Fleet Foxes was rated album of the year by Billboard's Critic's Choice and in Metacritic's end of year best album round-up it appeared in 17 lists, topping six of them. Furthermore, it had sold over 408,000 copies in North America and over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom, making it the first gold certificate record for UK label Bella Union. Their growing profile enabled the band to make televised appearances, playing on Vincent Moon's La Blogotheque in December 2008 and on Saturday Night Live the following January. In 2009, they toured in Europe to favorable reviews; the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said their show in Paradiso induced goosebumps. In 2008 and 2009, the band played globally ending the tour in September with a final European leg.

Helplessness Blues (2009–12)
Pecknold said that he would have liked the album to be released in 2009; however, the band's touring schedule delayed rehearsals of the new songs until February 2009. These sessions took place in a rented house outside Seattle, but were mostly scrapped, losing the band $60,000 of their own money. Further delays ensued because the drummer, Tillman, was scheduled to play a solo tour in Europe and North America throughout the 2009–10 winter. Pecknold later sent some demos to producer Phil Ek and expressed the hope that the second LP would emerge in late 2010.

In December 2009, Pecknold said he wanted the new LP to sound ""less poppy, less upbeat and more groove-based"". He referenced the 12-string guitar sound from Roy Harper's folk album Stormcock, saying, ""That will be the primary sonic distancing from the last record."" He wanted the band to record very quickly, with ""vocal takes in one go, so even if there are fuck-ups, I want them to be on there. I want there to be guitar mistakes. I want there to be not totally flawless vocals. I want to record it and have that kind of cohesive sound. Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, to me, is the best-sounding album because it sounds like there were only six hours in the universe for that album to be recorded in. So I want it to have that feeling."" The band eventually began recording in April 2010 in various locations (including West Hurley, New York) under the label Reciprocal Recording and decided to scrap the earlier idea of a fast recording (though according to the band many of the initial vocals were done in one take). The album features a new six-piece band line up, with the addition of the former Blood Brothers bassist Morgan Henderson on upright bass and woodwind instruments.

The album, Helplessness Blues, was released on May 3, 2011 with a cover illustrated by the Seattle artist Toby Liebowitz and painted by Christopher Alderson. The title track was released via free download on January 31, 2011, and the album's fourth track, ""Battery Kinzie"", was premiered in the UK on Zane Lowe's radio show on March 22, 2011. The Sub Pop record label released a downloadable music video of the track ""Grown Ocean"", with footage of the album's recording, on its website in support of the album. A 12"" vinyl double A-side single of ""Helplessness Blues"" and ""Grown Ocean"" was released for Record Store Day on April 16, 2011. On November 1, 2011, Pecknold's brother, Sean Pecknold, released the official music video for ""The Shrine / An Argument"".

Helplessness Blues was nominated as Best Folk Album at the 2012 Grammy Awards, held February 12, 2012.

Departure of Tillman and hiatus (2012–2016)
On January 18, 2012, after the band had finished touring for the album, drummer Tillman announced that he had left the band. He would go on to reinvent himself and record several albums as Father John Misty, notable for his ironic sense of humor in lyrics and media as well as often criticizing both the record industry and society in interviews and on stage.

In October 2020, Pecknold reflected on Tillman's departure during a Reddit AMA: ""[Josh] ""quit"" the band after recording drums for Helplessness, got into narcotics and made his first Father John Misty album while I was making Helplessness in Seattle. Then Sub Pop offered to put out his album, but only if he delayed it for a year or so and toured Helplessness with us. Which we all weakly agreed to going through with, but it quickly became obvious he'd rather have just been doing that project instead, and I would have rathered that as well. So that tour I had to endure being around a lot of substance abuse, sabotaged shows, just general ill treatment, shit-talking, all while paying him for songs he didn't have anything to do with. It sucked!""

On June 15, 2013, an image of a home recording set-up–including a laptop computer, microphone and guitar–was posted on the Fleet Foxes Facebook page with the caption ""Step one"". On June 16, 2013, an image of a broken mandolin with the caption ""Step two"" was posted. These images were later deleted, but led to speculation that the group was working on a new project, possibly a third studio album. On April 23, 2014, Robin Pecknold posted to the band's Facebook page that he had moved to New York to get his undergraduate degree at the Columbia University School of General Studies, a liberal arts college of Columbia University in New York City.

Crack-Up (2016–2018)
On May 18, 2016, while answering fan questions on his Instagram account, Pecknold confirmed that Fleet Foxes were working on new material with drummer and frequent collaborator Neal Morgan, best known for his work with Joanna Newsom and Bill Callahan. Describing Morgan as a ""full Fox"", Pecknold also admitted he ""had to up my songwriting game for homeboy."" However, when Pecknold posted a photo of the band minus Morgan on Instagram, he clarified that Morgan was one of three drummers involved in the new album, and that for the time being Fleet Foxes would consist of Pecknold, Skjelset, Wescott, Wargo, and Henderson as a ""five-piece 'core band'"", but they would still use a drummer for live performances and additional musicians for certain shows. Pecknold also said that the new material would be ""a different vibe"" compared to Fleet Foxes' previous output. On November 14, 2016, the band confirmed (via their Facebook account) that their new album was nearly complete.

On December 25, 2016, Pecknold posted a photo on his Instagram account which showed four albums in the Fleet Foxes' queue in his iTunes library: the first studio album Fleet Foxes; the Sun Giant EP; the second studio album Helplessness Blues; and an unknown third album entitled Ylajali. This led to speculation that the band's third album would: 1) be named after a character from Knut Hamsun's novel Hunger; 2) contain a photo from Japanese photographer Hiroshi Hamaya as the cover art; and 3) be released through Nonesuch Records, since the label's logo can be seen on the album cover.

In an email newsletter on January 1, 2017, production company Mason Jar Music confirmed that Fleet Foxes was working on a new album, since they contributed to the production. The album was called Crack-Up, after an F. Scott Fitzgerald essay of the same name. The album is a concept album and was recorded at Electric Lady Studios and Sear Sound in New York City.

On March 7, 2017, Fleet Foxes announced their third studio album, Crack-Up, released on June 16, 2017 via Nonesuch Records, a new label for the band. The lead single, ""Third of May / Ōdaigahara"", was released the same day. On April 4, 2017, the band posted the album trailer for the new album on YouTube. The trailer briefly presents various songs from the album and shows some images while they were recording them. The video was made by Sean Pecknold, Robin's brother.

On May 15, 2017, Fleet Foxes made their live return at the Wilma Theatre in Missoula, in which they performed nine songs from Crack-Up along with a selection of older material and a cover of ""In the Morning"" by Bee Gees. The band's current live line-up includes Matt Barrick of The Walkmen, who is also the most heavily featured of the three guest drummers who contributed to Crack-Up. Barrick has continued to play with the band, but has not become an official member. The new album also included the sounds of a brass quartet called The Westerlies.

On October 10, 2017, the band announced the release of a new EP, entitled The Electric Lady Session, for Black Friday Record Store Day 2017. The EP was released on November 24 of that year, and is a collection of live performances of four songs from Crack-Up, originally recorded for their session at Fordham University’s radio station WFUV. For Record Store Day 2018, the band released another EP, entitled ""Crack Up (Choral Version)""/""In The Morning (Live in Switzerland)"", in collaboration with the Icelandic female choir, Graduale Nobili.

Shore (2019–present)
On December 31, 2018, Pecknold teased several new demos online for an upcoming new album.

78,78,zoé,383613,19427172,"There are, at least, three artists known as Zoé: 1) A Mexican rock band. 2) An aka of Zoë Pollock (also, aka Zoë). 3) A French-speaking variétés françaises singer.

1) A Mexican rock band, that's not not afraid of experimenting, with a modern sound, an eclectic style, some British influences & overall, their music's sophisticated without loss of rock energy. Their lyrics cover many subjects / feelings, with the same level of sophistication that their music shows, plus honesty. They usually write songs in Spanish, sometimes in English or a combination of both languages.

They began as a band in 1994; as time went by, the band changed members several times until the definite lineup stuck in 1997 with León Larregui (vocals and guitar), Sergio Acosta (guitar), Beto Cabrera (drums), Ángel Mosqueda (bass) and Chucho Báez (keyboards). Then the band made a demo and many gigs on their own with the little resources that they had; with all that, Zoé began to call the attention of the hispanic radio stations in the U.S. Later in 1998, Zoé signed a record deal with Sony Music Mexico and began making their first record in 2000; this album, self titled, came out and quickly became a favorite of the audience in Mexico; after that, the band performed songs in soundracks of movies such as 'Amar Te Duele', 'Ladies Night' and 'The Dreamer'.

Fast forward to 2003. Zoé, along with producer Phil Vinall (Placebo, Elastica, Pulp), recorded their second album called 'Rocanlover', which became more successful than the first one thanks to hit songs like 'Peace & Love' and 'Veneno', which aired in several TV countdowns.

In 2005, after three years of working together, Zoé left Sony Music because of the lack of real interest that this record label had in them and signed a new deal with Noiselab; with a newfound belief in record labels, Zoé made an EP called 'The Room', which debuted at the top of the rankings in Mexico. This EP includes, among others, the song 'Dead' (first single); also,are including ""She Comes"" and ""Morning Watts"" as new songs  and also some remixes of ""Dead"" by great electronic artists from Mexico such as Sonido Lasser Drakkar or Los Dynamite, plus a couple of videos.

On July 12th, 2006; Zoé (now wih Rodrigo Guardiola in the drums) presented their more recent production, ""Memo Rex Commander y el Corazón atómico de la Vía Láctea"", a sophisticate, layered production, which tops several magazines' rankings. Both Zoé and producer Phil Vinall worked very hard in Tornillo, Texas, a remote town in the desert, to get ""Memo Rex"" finished.

In fall 2006, Zoé headlined the Rockampeonato Tour, along with other Noiselab signees like Los Dynamite and Los Odio!, which held shows at cities like Mérida, Guadalajara and many others. This is the biggest tour Zoé has been a part of since they were formed.

In 2007 Zoé recorded ""281107"", a live album that celebrates their first 10 years as a band, it was recorded on the Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City, this recording went platinum pretty quickly which is something unusual for live recordings in Mexico. On November 11th 2008 ""Repileptric"" Zoé's seventh studio album was released.

2) An alias of Zoë Pollock (b. in Peckham, London, UK - aka Zoë, Zoe, Hepzibah Broom & Pollack), is a pop / rock / folk singer who began her career in the mid-80s, dated Martin Glover (aka Youth, who produced her early work), released three solo albums (two as Zoë, another as Hepzibah Broom) & several singles. She is now a member of Mama.

Her 1991 début, Scarlet Red And Blue (originally, released as Zoë's Scarlet Red And Blue), contained Sunshine On A Rainy Day & ""Lightning"" (aka Sunshine On A Rainy Day & Lightning, with 'Zoe' spelling), which have been her biggest hits, to date (peaking at #4 & #37, respectively - on the UK chart).

In 1996, Zoë re-emerged - still with M & G Records & bringing a revamped image / style / sound - releasing an americana-styled rock album, Hammer.

Re-emerging again, around 2008, she has released Hepzibah Broom (as Hephzibah Broom) & formed female folk duo 'Mama' (with singer Sarah McQuaid - their début release is Crow Coyote Buffalo).

79,79,lissom,119498,1157188,"Reconnecting with life after having seen and lived everything. Opening one's eyes again after trauma, loss, or a lost love. Lissom’s Eclipses brings to life these experiences. After a first eponymous record characterized by its romanticism and delicacy (2018, Whales Records), the duo composed of pianist, composer, and producer Julien Marchal and British songwriter and producer Lowswimmer (Ed Tullett) returns with Eclipses, a refined and poetic play of light. The two composers, separated by the sea and the past years’ confinements, worked remotely, exchanging their contributions via Ableton Live (a music creation software). This process brought a unique emotion and warmth to their masterful assets, imparting the feeling that the singer's falsetto and the Frenchman's minimalist piano longed to find each other and embrace. Separation anxiety impregnates the record: the loneliness that comes with it, but also the luminous hope of rebirth and the resumption of a former life. Here, the memory of the other is often painful, but also a source of comfort. Love betrays and hurts, but constitutes, by the trace it leaves and the promise it carries. ‘Eclipses’ is a more transparent and airy record than Lissom’s eponymous debut; simpler and perhaps even more moving. The presence of melancholy reveals a desolate but pure serenity that permeates all the tracks, just like Lowry's restrained distress.. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lissom"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

80,80,the knocks,647908,8260717,"The Knocks are a production and DJ duo who specialize in melodic, carefree dance music that draws from soul, funk, disco, rap, and pop. Making their name with several singles and remixes, as well as EPs like 2011's Magic, they made their full-length debut in 2016 with 55, which featured a diverse array of guests such as Cam'ron, Carly Rae Jepsen, Wyclef Jean, and Walk the Moon. Following side project diversions that delved into future funk (Amelia Airhorn) and tropical house (the Mary Nixons), the Knocks presented another feel-good disco-house throwback with 2019's New York Narcotic. The duo subsequently released projects with artists like Gallant, Rivers Cuomo, and Foster the People, with whom they recorded the covers-heavy 2021 EP Melody & Silence. The collaboration-heavy full-length outing HISTORY appeared the following year.

The Knocks were formed in 2008 by James ""JPatt"" Patterson and Ben ""DJ B-Roc"" Ruttner. Patterson and Ruttner met at New York City's New School and shared an apartment, where they set up small recording studios in their bedrooms. The loud noise coming from their apartment led to neighbors constantly knocking on their door in order to get them to pipe down, hence the duo's name. Early success as remixers, however, enabled them to build their own studio in Manhattan. During 2008 and 2009, Knocks remixes surfaced for Katy Perry (""I Kissed a Girl""), Britney Spears (""3""), and PRGz (""Soul Glo""). B-Roc and Andrew W.K. also released DAMN! The Mixtape Vol. 1 in 2009, featuring several Knocks productions.

In 2010, the Knocks released their first singles, the sunny ""Dancing with the DJ"" (which later appeared on their 2011 EP Magic) and the whistling ""Make It Better."" Over the course of the next few years, the duo's profile was magnified by additional remixes for Tegan and Sara (""Closer""), the 1975 (""Girls""), and Dragonette (""Let It Go""), among others, in addition to tours with Ellie Goulding, Dragonette, and Sleigh Bells. They also collaborated with Fred Falke for the Kitsuné Music release ""Geronimo"" in 2012, as well as Treasure Fingers for ""DYWT,"" released on Fool's Gold Clubhouse in 2014. Also in 2014, the group released an EP, titled Comfortable and released on the Neon Gold label, that included collaborations with X Ambassadors and Ra Ra Riot.

Signed to Big Beat, the Knocks slowed it down a bit for the 2014 single ""Classic,"" one of their funkier and more disco-indebted singles, featuring Powers. An EP titled So Classic appeared in April 2015, followed by a new version of ""Classic"" featuring a verse by Fetty Wap. The Knocks spent much of the year working on their long-delayed debut album, which was previewed by the singles ""I Wish (My Taylor Swift)"" (with Matthew Koma) and ""New York City"" (featuring Cam'ron). Finally, in March 2016, the duo released their first full-length, 55, which included additional guest appearances from Wyclef Jean, Walk the Moon, Carly Rae Jepsen, Alex Newell, and Semi-Precious Weapons' Justin Trantor. That July, the pair remixed selected tracks from the album on the 55.5 EP.

In early 2017, the Knocks released Testify, an EP of new songs featuring collaborations with MNEK, Delacey, and Tayla Parx. Later that year, the duo teamed up with Skylar Spence and released a future funk mixtape as Amelia Airhorn. They also formed the Mary Nixons, a group with Mat Zo, and issued the single ""Adrian."" They followed with the Captain Cuts collaboration ""House Party."" July 2018 saw the release of the single ""Shades"" which appeared later that year on the Knocks' second full-length, New York Narcotic. The album also featured contributions from Method Man, Sofi Tukker, and Foster the People.

2019 brought several singles, including the Kah-Lo collaboration ""Awa Ni"" and ""Lucky Me"" (with Great Good Fine Ok). Most of these were collected on the EP Summer Series: 2019. Several more singles arrived in 2020, including ""One Fine Day"" (with Idris Elba), ""Bodies"" (with MUNA), and ""All About You"" (featuring Foster the People). The following year, they released Melody & Silence, an EP with Foster the People that included a remix of the single, as well as covers of hits by Beck, Moby, and the Verve. Also in 2021, the Knocks released ""R U High"" (featuring Mallrat) and ""Sound the Alarm"" (featuring Rivers Cuomo and Royal & the Serpent), and were featured on Purple Disco Machine's ""Fireworks."" The following year saw the release of the full-length effort, HISTORY, which featured collaborations with Foster the People, MUNA, Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs, Cold War Kids, Parson James, and Yoke Lore, among others.

87,87,xavier rudd,513648,8500221,"Xavier Rudd (born 29 May 1978) is a soulful Australian singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist whose songs encompass themes such as spirituality, humanity, environmentalism and the rights of Indigenous Australians. He recorded as Xavier Rudd & Izintaba for the 2010 album ""Koonyum Sun"" and as Xavier Rudd & the United Nations for the 2017 album ""Nanna"". 

Growing up in a family of seven children in Torquay, Victoria (Australia), near the famous surfing location Bells Beach, Rudd showed a keen interest in music. While primary school-aged, Rudd used his mother's vacuum cleaner as a makeshift didgeridoo and he began playing his brother's guitar. He also played saxophone and clarinet as a child. 

Before launching his solo career, Rudd began playing music as part of the band 'Xavier and the Hum'. In 2004, Rudd released Solace, his first album to be distributed by a major label. 

Rudd's music is compassionate and always manages to render emotion in his fans. His songs include stories of the mistreatment of the indigenous people of his homeland; they tell of humanity, spirituality or the environment. The songs are written and sung with compassion and they urge the celebration of life.

Rudd is skilled with a variety of instruments, include guitar, shaker, didgeridoo, Weissenborn slide guitar, Tongue drum, stomp boxe, djembe, harmonica, ankle bells, and slide banjo. It's an experience to watch him perform his songs live, as he plays the guitar, digeridoo and various percussion instruments simultaneously, using a unique stage setup. But the real magic comes when he opens his mouth and his soulful voice spills upon his audience.

Rudd recalls that when he was 10, his dad took him to see Paul Simon’s Graceland tour. “I remember seeing it and knowing that that was what I was gonna do,” he says. “I had no doubt. It sort of made sense, because I’d always lived in my head, in this world of song that was my own little secret. But to see that show and that whole thing happening, I sort of felt comfortable as a human, and thought.”  He learned to play the digeridoo, the 50,000-year-old wooden trumpet of the Aboriginal people, by practising on a vacuum cleaner pipe. 

As a teenager, Rudd really got into songwriting. He started performing at his school, with solo gigs following.  He drew inspiration from artists such as Leo Kottke, Ben Harper, Natalie Merchant and multi-instrumentalist David Lindley, as well as music from diverse sources, such as Hawaii and Native American music.

As with most solo artists, Rudd has experimented playing in a band. Though it was a short- lived experiment, as Rudd quickly found that it wasn't the right way to go for him. “What I do now is just more me,” he says. “And it sounds full.”

Quotes:

“It’s all about peace and happiness,” he says of his performances. “That’s sort of the blanket that seems to sort of settle in the room, or on the venue when I play, but I sort of feel not solely responsible. I don’t really feel like it’s me and the audience. I feel like it’s all of us, one big connection and I just happen to be channeling the energy through music. It comes from the audience and channels through me and I put it back in the audience.”

“My music is about good spirit. I’m so lucky to be able to do what I do. I’m so blessed to be able to be able to travel around and play music and connect with so many people in so many places in so many cultures. It’s a gift of life as a musician.”

After the failure of his marriage in 2009, Rudd was supported in his grief and recovery by new South African bandmates, bassist Tio Moloantoa and percussionist Andile Nqubezelo. Rudd had met Moloantoa and Nqubezelo performing at the 2008 Wiesen Nuke Festival in Austria. Rudd described his connection with Moloantoa and Nqubezelo as musical, spiritual and emotional—""I feel like they were sent to me,"" he said.

In 2010 Rudd bought 20 hectares of property at Koonyum Range, Mullumbimby, the location was the inspiration for the name of the album Rudd would release with Moloantoa and Nqubezelo, titled ""Koonyum Sun"", as Xavier Rudd & Izintaba. The album moved away from the heavier sound of Rudd's 2008 album ""Dark Shades of Blue"" to a more up-beat style. 

""Nanna"", the 2015 album Rudd released as Xavier Rudd & the United Nations champions cultural understanding and condemns racism and intolerance. It features a diverse group of musicians from Australia, South Africa, Samoa, Germany, Ireland, and Papua New Guinea.  

In 2018, Rudd released ""Storm Boy"".  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Xavier+Rudd"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

She went back to Brooklyn two years later at age 21 to record her debut album, Youth Novels, which was released in Sweden on January 30, 2008. Produced by Björn Yttling of the band Peter Bjorn and John along with Lasse Mårtén, Youth Novels gained international acclaim for its confessional lyrics and minimalistic production. It was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland in June 2008 and in the United States on August 19. Her single ""Little Bit"" from the album captured widespread attention, gaining praise from the indie community and the music site Stereogum, which described her style as a blend of soul, electro, and “powdered-sugar pop.”

Building on the success of her debut, Lykke Li continued to release music that explored themes of love, heartache, and introspection. Her follow-up albums, Wounded Rhymes in 2011 and I Never Learn in 2014, showcased a more mature, emotionally charged sound, with Wounded Rhymes earning her two Swedish Grammy Awards for Artist of the Year and Album of the Year in 2012. Alongside her solo career, she collaborated with prominent artists like Kleerup and Röyksopp, lending her vocals to the tracks ""Until We Bleed,"" ""Miss It So Much,"" and ""Were You Ever Wanted."" Her growing popularity led to notable appearances on shows like Conan and Skavlan in early 2011, helping her reach an even broader audience.

In 2016, Lykke Li co-founded the band LIV alongside members of Miike Snow and Peter Bjorn and John, further expanding her creative pursuits. Two years later, she released her fourth album, So Sad So Sexy (2018), marking a shift towards a more mainstream pop sound infused with late-2010s production influences. Her 2022 album, Eyeye, saw her return to a more introspective and sonically experimental approach, once again showcasing her characteristic blend of melancholic lyrics and innovative production. Over her career, Lykke Li has built a reputation for her sensuous, ethereal vocals and innovative musical style, solidifying her place as a significant figure in contemporary indie pop and electronic music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lykke+Li"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The music has been called folk, nature-pop and baroque pop. But with two songwriters, one male and one female, and an organic approach to composition, the result is a sound they feel they can call their own.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/River+Whyless"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

97,97,khruangbin,893469,36236714,"Khruangbin (IPA: /ˈkɹʌŋbɪn/) is an American three-piece band from Houston, Texas, formed of Laura Lee on bass, Mark Speer on guitar, and Donald Johnson on drums. The trio's first single 'A Calf Born In Winter' was released in May 2014 by Late Night Tales offshoot Night Time Stories, and saw support from DJs Zane Lowe, Cerys Matthews, Tom Ravenscroft, Gideon Coe and magazines as musically diverse as Test Pressing, For Folks Sake, i-D, The 405 and Ransom Note. 'The Infamous Bill' is an expanded offering of Khruangbin's exotic, individual sound. The EP's four tracks were recorded at their spritual home, a remote barn deep in the Texas countryside where Khruangbin's first rehearsals took place. Taking influence from 1960's Thai funk - Khruangbin literally translates to ""Engine Fly"" in Thai - the EP is steeped in the bass heavy, psychedelic sound of their inspiration, Tarantino soundtracks and surf-rock cool.

Mark and DJ's roots are in R&B, hip hop and gospel having played within the same gospel band for years. Both professional musicians, Mark began teaching Laura how to play bass in the summer of 2009. As such, Laura quickly developed a huge passion for the instrument and the aesthetic it brought to music she loved. Having worked studiously on developing her skills, both Mark and Laura were invited to tour with Ninja Tune's YPPAH supporting Bonobo across his 2010 American tour. The tour galvanised the two of them to start making music together more seriously, sowing the first seeds of Khruangbin, with DJ the natural go to for drums. Having kept in touch, Bonobo included Khruangbin's 'A Calf Born In Winter' on his 2013 'Late Night Tales' compilation. In addition to increasing the Stateside following the band has built, the release has helped Khruangbin in topping both the US & UK 'Last FM' fastest growing artists whilst 'A Calf Born In Winter' continues to be one of the most popular single downloads from the compilation. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Khruangbin"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

99,99,arctic monkeys,6122742,723872910,"Arctic Monkeys is an alternative rock band formed in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England in 2002 after meeting at Stocksbridge High School. The band consists of Alex Turner (vocals, guitar, piano), Jamie Cook (guitar), Nick O'Malley (backing vocals, bass) and Matt Helders (drums, vocals). Founding bassist Andy Nicholson left in 2006.

The band has released seven studio albums: Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), Favourite Worst Nightmare (2007), Humbug (2009), Suck It and See (2011), AM (2013), Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018) and The Car (2022) (the first six of which debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart.

Each of the band's first five singles ""I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor"", ""When the Sun Goes Down"", ""Leave Before The Lights Come On"", ""Brianstorm"" and ""Fluorescent Adolescent"" hit the UK Top Five, but their sixth single, ""Teddy Picker"", only went Top 20 and their seventh single, ""Crying Lightning"" peaked at #12.

The band's rise to success started in late 2004/early 2005 when demo songs that had been handed out in CD form at gigs found their way onto the internet. These demos rapidly spread among message boards and friends leading to a growing fan base for the band, and were collected on the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk, which the band recognizes on their website.  The band owe much of their success to viral buzz via the Internet, and have eschewed typical 'commercial' channels, including refusing to appear on the UK's (now discontinued) Top Of The Pops music program, which was often seen as a gateway to success.

The band's debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, held the record for the largest first week sales of a debut album in the UK (in its first week, it sold more than the rest of the Top 20 albums combined). The album sold over 360,000 copies in its first week, but lost the title in November 2007 to Leona Lewis's album Spirit.

On 19th June 2006 the band officially announced that founding member and bassist Andy Nicholson had left the band after missing the American leg of their tour due to 'fatigue' and the other band members couldn't stand the constant 'missing his girlfriend syndrome' so they told him to sling his hook. Former Dodgems bassist Nick O'Malley was initially brought in as a stand-in, and played the band's remaining summer commitments. He was then announced as Nicholson's permanent replacement. 

The single ""Leave Before The Lights Come On"" came out on August 14th, but only reached Number 4 on the UK charts, denying the band a third consecutive number 1 single.

Their debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not won the 2006 Mercury Prize, was chosen as the best album of year 2006 by Q Magazine, and received a slew of other accolades.

Their second album Favourite Worst Nightmare was released on April 23rd 2007. It was preceded by ""Brianstorm"", the first single from the album, which was released a week before. Like its predecessor, ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"" sold more than the rest of the Top 20 combined, and - due to an error on iTunes - every song on the record appeared on the UK Top 200 Singles the next week.

When asked about Favourite Worst Nightmare Turner commented, ""We haven't changed that much. It's still about making contact with girls or not making contact with girls"".

The band began to write and record demos for the third album in January 2008, Turner said ""We had tunes that we'd already been playing on tour so we recorded them. That’s six [songs]. We’re going to take it easy and start practicing over the summer and doing new stuff.""

The band premiered new material from the unreleased album during their January 2009 tour of New Zealand, playing small venues in Wellington and Auckland ahead of the Big Day Out festival. Their first show in more than a year was on January 13, 2009 at Wellington's Town Hall. In both cities, the new songs played were ""Crying Lightning"", ""Go-Kart"", ""Dangerous Animals"" and ""Pretty Visitors."" The full setlist from the Auckland gig is available online. Also played was a cover of the Nick Cave song ""Red Right Hand."" During their last tour, the band had played new songs ""Put Me In A Terror Pocket"", ""Sandtrap,"" and ""The Fire and The Thud"" live.

Lead singer/songwriter Alex Turner started a two-man project with the singer from the Rascals, Miles Kane.
The band is called 'The Last Shadow Puppets'

The Arctic Monkeys band released their album Humbug in August of 2009, preceded by the single ""Crying Lightning""

They released their fourth studio album, Suck It And See, on June 6th, 2011.

They released their fifth studio album, AM, on September 9th, 2013.

They released their sixth studio album, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, with no preceding single releases, on May 11th, 2018.

They released their seventh studio album, The Car, on October 21st, 2022, preceded by the singles ""There'd Better Be a Mirrorball"", ""Body Paint"" and ""I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am"".

They made some show in US cities as ""a band out of time. One who faded away into obscurity after struggling to find success in the late 70's and early 80's. Only recently, the internet has begun to uncover the performances and recordings of a band that the world wasn't ready for.

105,105,twice,1323055,367055960,"There are numerous artists who have performed under the name Twice:

1. TWICE (Korean: 트와이스; Japanese: トゥワイス)  is a nine-member South Korean girl group formed by JYP Entertainment through the 2015 reality show SIXTEEN. The group is composed of: Nayeon (나연), Jeongyeon (정연), Momo (모모), Sana (사나), Jihyo (지효), Mina (미나), Dahyun (다현), Chaeyoung (채영) and Tzuyu (쯔위). 

On February 11, 2015, Park Jin-young announced that the lineup of JYP Entertainment's upcoming seven-member girl group would be decided through SIXTEEN, a competition survival show that would air on Mnet later that year. The show began on May 5 and ended with Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung as the winners. Park then announced that he would be increasing the size of the group from seven members to nine by adding Tzuyu, who was the ""audience's pick"" since she was the most popular contestant by the show's end, and Momo, who was added by Park himself since he felt the group needed someone with her performance abilities. The decision was controversial at the time with many people complaining about eliminated contestants being able to join the group.

The group debuted on October 20, 2015 with the extended play The Story Begins and title track ""OOH-AHH하게"". TWICE rose to fame in 2016 with their single ""CHEER UP"" from their second mini Page Two; the song charted at number 1 on the Gaon Digital Chart and became the best-performing single of the year.

106,106,ajr,1023571,43595267,"AJR is a New York City-based indie pop band composed of brothers Adam, Jack, and Ryan Met (born Metzger). The band is a DIY pop group who write, produce, and mix their own material in the living room of their Chelsea apartment. Their music style has been described as ""eclectic"", combining elements of pop, barbershop, electronic, and dubstep music. They have opened for Demi Lovato, Hoodie Allen and the Wanted. In Summer 2014 the band went on tour with Lindsey Stirling.

There is no band, no song, no video, no sound, that is more “now” than AJR. The band — three brothers born and raised in New York City — has achieved a startling quick level of success with “I’m Ready,” a buoyant electro-pop single that’s taking off on social media. The numbers: over 1.5M views on YouTube, thousands of singles sold each week, features in Billboard, the NY Post, and on MTV. Festival performances in front of 10,000+ people.

AJR started to become popular with their track ""Weak"", which they wrote in a few hours and released 16th September 2016, that was made Platinum in 5 countries, including the US, and Gold in 4 more. It has more than 500 million Spotify streams.
They followed this up with their album The Click, released 9th June 2017, featuring the single Weak as well as ""Drama"" and ""Sober Up"", the latter of which features Rivers Cuomo. The album reached no. 1 on Mediabase's alternative singles chart the following year. An extended ""Deluxe"" version of the album was released 21st September 2018, including an acoustic version of Pretender, a track they worked on with Steve Aoki and Lil Yachty.

30th January 2019 saw the release of ""100 Bad Days"", which was performed on Jimmy Kimmel on 11th March (coinciding with the release of another single, ""Birthday Party""), and got included on Taylor Swift's ""Playlist by ME!"" in May of that year. Dear Winter was released 5th April, and got a sequel, Dear Winter 2.0, on 25th October.
Neotheater was their next album. It was debuted 26th April 2019 and was possibly where the band got noticed the most, hitting number one on Billboard's Top Rock and Top Alternative charts, and 8th on the Top 200 Albums. It featured 100 Bad Days, Birthday Party, and Dear Winter.

""Bang!"" came next on 13th February 2020, at first intended for a Deluxe version of Neotheater, but later integrated into their next album OK Orchestra. ""Bummerland"" was then released 31st August 2020. 22nd of December 2020 saw the release of My Play, 2 days after they announced OK Orchestra as an album. Then 17th February 2021 saw the release of ""Way Less Sad"".

108,108,viagra boys,353001,13184564,"Generating a singular brand of noisy chaos, Swedish post-punk band Viagra Boys fuse pounding hard rock grooves, minimalist melodies, discordant guitar and sax, and howling vocals into an uncompromised volley of sound. Fascinated with drugs, anger, and the evils of male privilege, Viagra Boys became a cult phenomenon in their homeland before word spread throughout Europe, the United Kingdom, and North America about their punishing and articulate approach. After making their recording debut and setting their creative template with the 2016 EP Consistency of Energy, Viagra Boys both refined and sharpened their signature sound on their first full-length album, 2018's Street Worms. The album's strong critical reception helped bolster enthusiasm for their follow-up, Welfare Jazz, which appeared in early 2021.

Viagra Boys formed in 2015 in Stockholm, Sweden. Tattoo artists Henrik Höckert and Sebastian Murphy (the latter born in San Francisco but living in Stockholm) met through a mutual acquaintance and went out for a night of drinking. The two ended up at a karaoke bar, and after hearing Murphy belt out a unique version of Mariah Carey's ""We Belong Together,"" Höckert decided they needed to form a band. With Murphy on lead vocals and Höckert on bass, they recruited guitarist Benjamin Vallé, who had previously worked with Höckert in the group Nitad. With the addition of drummer Sol Tor Sjödén, the core of the group was complete and they began writing songs.

By the time Viagra Boys started playing out in June 2015, they'd added Oskar Karls on sax and producer Martin Ehrencrona on keyboards. By 2016, they decided it was time to document their music, and they cut a four-song EP, Consistency of Energy, issued by Kosmos Recordings. The Push My Buttons label brought out their second record, the 2017 EP Call of the Wild, but for their first full-length album, 2018's Street Worms, they signed with Year0001 Records, putting them on the same label as Swedish rapper Yung Lean. If the band was uncomfortable with the association, they didn't show it, and Street Worms got enthusiastic reviews while the tracks ""Sports"" and ""Just Like You"" earned enough streaming plays and video views to raise their following beyond the underground. Viagra Boys' unpredictable live show was documented on a 2019 concert recording, Shrimp Sessions, that was released only in Japan. In April 2020, Viagra Boys were back with their first studio recordings since Street Worms, a forceful four-song EP titled Common Sense. This was followed in January 2021 by Welfare Jazz, their chaotic and subversively satirical sophomore full-length. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Viagra+Boys"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

113,113,belle mt.,32192,174123,"Belle Mt. [spoken bell-mont] is a project conceived by songwriter and lead singer Matt Belmont during a period of withdrawal from public performances and releases between 2014 and 2016. During this time, he dedicated himself to introspective periods of songwriting development, beginning a musical and geographical journey as he wrote, co-wrote and produced. 
     The climax of this initial 2-year endeavor of expression and development saw him retreat to a friend's unfinished family holiday home to write in solitude at the foothills of the French alps. There Matt started experimenting with a new epic, cinematic sound mirroring his surroundings and the beautiful mountain views out of his makeshift studio window and beginning to build ethereal productions, developing the raw basis of a sound that would find its way into the hands of Nashville-based, Grammy award-winning producer Femke Weidema. As a former collaborator of prolific film composer Hans Zimmer, Femke's production reflects a deep knowledge of rich layering & the creation of dramatic soundscapes. 
     The sounds of the first EP could be summarized by deeply poetic lyrics and alt-pop melodies steeped in layered ambience and depth. Working out of home project studios on a shoestring budget, eight songs were written and demoed in that first 10-day trip, and the haunting lead-track ‘Hollow’ was born.
     Performing live as a 3-piece, the epic productions have been delivered to audiences on lineups, which range from British Summertime Hyde Park with Bruno Mars and Khalid to Popfest Dusseldorf with Macklemore and Clean Bandit. A combination of the powerful and intricate beats of Chris Burgess on drums/percussion and Ben Worsley’s swirling ethereal guitar sounds added to Belmont's emotive vocals, synth and acoustic guitar have been captivating audiences worldwide. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Belle+Mt."">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

118,118,beta radio,285840,2029039,"Beta Radio is an American band from Wilmington, North Carolina. The group consists of Benjamin Mabry and Brent Holloman. Stylistically, their music features an amalgam of folk, indie, chamber pop, rock and Americana influences.

Musically reminiscent at times of Bon Iver’s atmosphere heavy For Emma, Forever Ago or the Grateful Dead’s “Mountains of the Moon” from their 1969 release Aoxomoxoa, the sonic landscape of the band's album Seven Sisters is sparse but far from empty.  On tracks like “Khima,” “Borderline” and “Brother, Sister,” the slow scrawl of the banjo melody floats through the song and surrounds you like birdsong, coming at you predictably but surprisingly from several directions at once.  Each of the songs on this album stays with you, forming a soundtrack for and changing the shape of the rest of your day.

It’s appropriate that a debut album concern itself with creation and Seven Sisters is no exception.  Whether it is the creation of love and a place for that love, as the narrative of the album suggests; or the creation of the universe, as the album’s title and repetition of astronomical and astrological imagery suggests; Beta Radio’s lyrics and music carve out a space in your head and find a way to fit into your own cosmology.

Lyrically, Seven Sisters explores religion, albeit from a couch rather than a pulpit.  The religious allusions are subtle and unobtrusive, concerning themselves more with mysticism than proselytization, much like David Eugene Edwards’ 16 Horsepower and Wovenhand.

Line for line, the lyrics are beautiful and surprising.  In “A Place for Me” the lines “I wanted not to fight / With my heart but I’ll fight with my fists all night” evoke the heartache of leaving, of lovers’ spats of loss and regret.

The album leaves you with a simple but urgent lyric refrain in “Return to Darden Road”– “Where do you go? / Come back to me / ‘Cause I love you so.” Review by deckfight <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Beta+Radio"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

119,119,peach pit,877606,35077269,"There are at least 2 bands sharing the name Peach Pit.

1) Peach Pit are a pop band from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The band is led by singer and rhythm guitarist Neil Smith, lead guitarist Christopher Vanderkooy, bassist Peter Wilton, and drummer Mikey Pascuzzi. They describe their own music as ""chewed bubblegum pop"", whereas critics have described their sound as ""sad pop and surf rock"" and has a soft spoken vocal style with guitar driven rock melodies. The band's music videos are produced by videographer Lester Lyons-Hookham. The band have sported the same clothes for every live performance since buying them for their first music video shoot.

The group formed when high school friends, Neil Smith and Chris Vanderkooy, decided to collaborate on a musical project in 2014. Peter Wilton and Mikey Pascuzzi joined them on bass and drums. In June 2016, the band released its debut EP, Sweet FA, produced and recorded by Smith's former roommate Harley Small at The Space Studios in Vancouver BC. They quickly began work on their follow up release and debut LP, Being So Normal. The album was again recorded by Harley Small at The Space Studios  and was released in September 2017 on the Vancouver indie label Kingfisher Bluez.

Vocalist/rhythm guitarist Neil Smith was formerly part of the folk band Dogwood and Dahlia. Smith and bassist Peter Wilton formerly worked as Amazon delivery drivers, guitarist Christopher Vanderkooy worked at a local Vancouver brewery, and drummer Mikey Pascuzzi worked as a carpenter. The band quit their jobs to go on their first tour of North America, Europe and Asia from 2017-2018. They have been touring steadily ever since the release of their debut album.

2) Peach Pit is a 4-piece math/post rock band from Croatia formed in 1994.

The idea of making a band was started by Bruno Vidović and Mihael Bele in 1994, and after few parties, name Peach Pit (after an odd restaurant in the 90210) emerged as a name for a band that would create noise rock on the heritage of Big Black, Killdozer, Scratch acid and others. Peach Pit's first lineup was formed in the autumn of 1994 and it consisted of Mihael Bele on guitar, Bruno Vidović on drums and Branko Beðtak on bass.

First concerts which promoted early materials that featured vocals were loud and genuinely violent and often featured stage acts such as firecrackers, feedback and stage diving, for which they were often discarded as juvenile and abrupted by sound engineers by pulling out of electricity or even police.

By 1996, Peach Pit turned completely instrumental under influence of new music from across the water, and also played a lot of shows, some of them with noted names such as Zeni Geva. In the spring of 1997, Franjo Gluðac (previously from Liquid Light, also instrumental) joined Peach Pit on the second guitar, and his coming also marked departure of Beðtak which left Peach Pit as a three-piece with Franjo and Mihael on guitars and basses and Bruno on drums. Along with that, first compilation appearances were made, and Peach Pit was now open to audiences outside of Zagreb and started making materials for the first release.

Tricky Slaughter Operation cd-r (burned in 100 copies) was issued in the spring of 1998 and featured Tomica Ðãavina of Brassneck on bass (who left after the album was recorded and a short tour) and also Beðtak's guest appearance on one song. It was recorded live during a six month period in Kozmo. During that period Mihael and Franjo were also the guitar part of the Lunar with which Peach Pit shared a practice room.

Next self-release was Autom csep, which was mostly recorded by overdubbing in Kozmo in summer of 1998 and was issued along with Christmas greeting card ep which was recorded later that year. It was followed by a short concert break which was used for making of a first official album, Suspicios Cargo which was recorded in june of 1999 and was issued nine months later on Ivica Barièeviã's Earwing records. Bara also became promotor for most of the Peach Pit's concerts during that period.

Finishing of Suspicious cargo also marked Bruno Motik being recruited on second guitar, which created current lineup that exists since 1999. His coming brought complexity to songwriting and a step toward exploring new techniques which became our trademark since then.

In the summer of 2000, material for a second album (Music for the Fruitcake Generation) was recorded but was lost. That period was marked with heavy concerting which, along with a album material failure brought some problems to the band after which Peach Pit decided to take a one year break in 2001 after which a short European tour in 2003, that featured five-piece with Branko Beðtak(again) on bass, and Bruno Motik on second drums and guitar, took place. Also, Peach Pit also named a genre for the music which they are playing, sport-rock.

Later, in 2004 some of the songs from the lost material were re-recorded in Kozmo using live recording technique directly to tape and are to be released on Interstellar records Supernova 2 compilation. Four new Sport Rock songs have been recorded (26mins) in january 2006 in Kozmo, and are awaiting mix. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Peach+Pit"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

121,121,natalia lafourcade,640869,21022291,"María Natalia Lafourcade Silva (born 26 February 1984) is a Mexican pop and folk singer-songwriter who since her debut in 2003 has been one of the most successful singers in Latin America. Lafourcade's voice has been categorized as a lyric soprano.

Lafourcade was born in Mexico City, Mexico, surrounded by music and art. Her father is the Chilean musician Gastón Lafourcade who had French parents and her mother is the pianist María del Carmen Silva Contreras. Her uncle is the Chilean writer Enrique Lafourcade, a representative of the so-called ""Generation of the 50s"". She attended Instituto Anglo Español, a Catholic middle school, and studied painting, flute, theater, music, acting, piano, guitar, saxophone and singing. When she was 10, Natalia sang in a Mariachi group.

She grew up in Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico, where she studied music with her mother, María del Carmen Silva Contreras, imitating artists such as Gloria Trevi and Garibaldi. Her mother studied piano with a specialty in musical pedagogy and is the creator of the Macarsi Method for musical training and personal development for children and educators. She adapted and practiced the method with Natalia to help her rehabilitate through music following a head injury from being kicked by a horse.  

When she was 17, Loris Ceroni gave Lafourcade the opportunity to be in a pop/rock group under his guidance. Lafourcade was hesitant, and Ceroni instead encouraged her to become independent. Lafourcade produced her first LP under the label of Sony Music. It was recorded in Italy and was cowritten with Aureo Baqueiro. Sabo Romo played in 2 songs. Natalia Lafourcade is a mix of pop, rock, bossa-nova and Latin rhythms. It features the songs ""Busca Un Problema"", ""Elefantes"", ""Te Quiero Dar"", ""Mírame, Mírate"", and her biggest hit, ""En El 2000"". 

In 2005, she released Casa, her second album, but this time as Natalia y La Forquetina, the name of her band. Produced mostly by Café Tacuba's Emmanuel del Real, Casa presents a more mature, rock-oriented sound while retaining pop and bossa-nova influences on a few tracks, such as lead single ""Ser Humano"" (pop-rock) and its follow-up ""Casa"" (pop-bossa-nova). Aureo Baqueiro returned to produce the few tracks not produced by del Real.  More than a year after Natalia departed from La Forquetina, she recorded an instrumental album called The 4 Seasons of Love under Sony BMG label. She also wrote the Lyrics for ""Tú y Yo"" from Ximena Sariñana's self-titled album. 

In 2009, she released the album Hu Hu Hu, a top 10 album in Mexico. The album was produced by Emmanuel del Real (who produced ""Casa"" in 2005), Marco Moreno and Ernesto García. It was nominated for Best female Pop Vocal Album at the 2009 Latin Grammy Awards (won by Laura Pausini) and Best Latin Pop album at the 2010 Grammy Awards (won by La Quinta Estación). Club Fonograma also named the album the second best of 2009, and the seventh best of the decade.

In 2012, she released a tribute album to Agustín Lara called Mujer Divina.

Her next album, Hasta La Raíz, was released in March 2015. ""Nunca Es Suficiente"" (It's Never Enough), the first single off the album, was released on 10 February. The track ""Hasta La Raíz"" was No. 5 of the Viral 50 Global Spotify Chart and the No. 1 on the Viral 50 México chart.

In 2017, she recorded ""Remember Me"" as a duet with contemporary R&B singer Miguel for the credits of the movie Coco, and together they also performed the song at the 90th Academy Awards ceremony.

2020 saw her release the eponymous Un Canto por México, Vol. 1.

The group, which takes its name from the surnames of its founding members Annen, May, and Kantereit, initially formed in 2011 while the members were still attending Schiller-Gymnasium school in Sülz. 

The band started performing on the streets of Cologne, with videos of their performances garnering a following on social media. During one of their practice sessions, they eventually welcomed double bass player Lars Lötgering into the fold. 

In 2013, AnnenMayKantereit released its first self-recorded album, which was celebrated with a launch party in Cologne's Gebäude 9 venue. They continued to gain traction with German audiences, performing at various festivals and supporting big names such as Clueso and the Beatsteaks.

The band's signing with Universal Records in 2015 led to recording an EP titled ""Wird schon irgendwie gehen"" at Hansa-Studios in Berlin. Following this, AnnenMayKantereit embarked on sell-out tours and continued to solidify its place in the German music scene.

AnnenMayKantereit has released several albums throughout their career. In 2013, they released their first self-recorded album, which had a release party in Cologne.

After releasing the music video for their song ""Wohin du gehst,"" the band toured Germany.

132,132,cocoon,272175,4527884,"There are at least six bands called Cocoon:

1. Cocoon is a two-piece French band formed in 2006 by Mark Daumail (born 1984, composition, lead vocals, acoustic guitar, ukelele, banjo, beatbox, etc.) and Morgane Imbeaud (born 1987, vocal harmonies, keyboards, arrangements).

""I wanted it to be a male-female duet. A duo like the White Stripes are in rock — we wanted to be the equivalent in folk music,"" Daumail says. Their songs are entirely sung in English. ""French artists singing in English isn't something new. It goes back to groups like Les Thugs and Syd Matters,"" he remarks.

Daumail says he's always been interested in folk music: ""Basically, Cocoon's musical inspiration goes all the way from groups like The Pentangle and Fairport Convention right through to the 'new folk' movement that surfaced around the beginning of 2000 with artists like CocoRosie, Devendra Banhart and Sufjan Stevens.""

In 2006, the pop / folk duet released its first EP, entitled I Hate Birds, and won the 2006 edition of the Big Jama regional contest. The following year, Cocoon was signed onto the French indie label Sober & Gentle. The band released a second EP, From Panda Mountains, followed by their first album, entitled My Friends All Died in a Plane Crash. The group won the CQFD music contest organized by the French magazine Les Inrockuptibles and performed in the new talent section of the rock music festivals Le Printemps de Bourges and Les Eurockéennes de Belfort.

2. Cocoon is a solo project by one of the founding members of the French group Clair Obscur which was one of the first groups in the 80's in France to work across music, visual arts, dance and theatre. Clair Obscur was one of the very few bands of the French cold wave/industrial scene which became known abroad with its records released by the British labels Cathexis, All the Madmen and NER (compilation From Torture to Conscience with Current 93, In the Nursery, Death in June, etc). 

Christophe Demarthe has been working for many years at the frontier of sound and visual arts. He has created sound architectures for theatre, dance, cinema, visual arts, radio... mainly working with the drama producer Bruno Lajara (501 Blues, Ne Pas, Fuites, Après Coups, Léon le Nul...) and with Jean Couturier for radio dramas on France Culture. He has written music for the cinema and for television (France 2, Canal Plus). 

In 2004 he created Cocoon, releasing his debut album on the French label Optical Sound. Much more than a mere sound object based on an album concept, Cocoon can be read as a global artistic project close to the performance. It is an audio set accompanied by videos and asking for an active participation of the public, banishing the passive listening of laptoppers. The stage disposition creates a real contrast with the characteristic immobility of electronic music concerts, and definitively places itself at the crossing point of image, sound and live show, for a moving interdisciplinarity. 

Since its creation in 2004, Cocoon has participated in the festivals Nowa Fabryka (Bytom, Poland), Emergences/Villette Numérique (Paris), Nuit Blanche (Paris), Emo-Son (Bourges), Salon Light (Paris)... He has been reviewed in Libération, on Arte-TV.com, in the magazines Mouvement, Télérama, The Wire, on France Culture... His second album, More Violent Days Are to Come (OS.012) (Optical Sound), has been nominated for the Qwartz Electronic Music Awards 2006/2007.

135,135,yumi zouma,365386,6664616,"Yumi Zouma are a New Zealand alternative pop band from Christchurch, Canterbury. The band consists of Christie Simpson (vocals, keyboards), Josh Burgess (guitar, bass guitar, vocals, keyboards), Charlie Ryder (guitar, bass guitar, keyboards), and Olivia Campion (drums). The band's name is an amalgamation of the two friends that encouraged the group to start writing together.

The group's origins trace back to their history of playing concerts together in Christchurch. However, the band did not begin writing music together until multiple members moved abroad and began collaborating over email following the events of the Christchurch earthquake. This early material gained attention within the musical blogosphere and encouraged American label Cascine to sign the band before they had played live or held a band practice.

Between 2014 and 2015, the group released two EPs (EP I, EP II). The band's debut album Yoncalla was released in 2016, including the singles ""Keep It Close To Me"" and ""Barricade (Matter Of Fact)"". In 2017, the band released their second album, Willowbank, and the singles ""December"", ""Depths (Pt. I)"", and ""Half Hour"". EP III was released in 2018, including the singles ""In Camera"" and ""Crush (It's Late Just Stay)"". In 2020, the band signed to labels Polyvinyl Record Co. and Inertia Music, and released their third album Truth or Consequences, which featured the singles ""Right Track / Wrong Man"", ""Cool For A Second"", ""Southwark"", ""Lonely After"", and ""Sage"".

Founded by Burgess, Ryder, and vocalist Kim Pflaum, the group began writing music using file-sharing services when Burgess left New Zealand to work at New York-based record label Captured Tracks. The band's first release, EP I, debuted in early 2014, after the single A Long Walk Home For Parted Lovers appeared on several blogs before being quickly taken down. The band was positively reviewed by Pitchfork and profiled by The Guardian, leading to the group signing with Brooklyn-based record label Cascine. In mid-2014, the band began playing live, touring with singer Lorde, and collaborating with other acts, such as the Swedish band Air France. Guitarist Sam Perry[ and vocalist Christie Simpson joined the group in 2015, while Pflaum left and started the solo project Madeira (later renamed Laumė). The band released a second EP, EP II, in early 2015, and proceeded to tour extensively throughout Europe, Asia, and North America, with the likes of Jamie xx and Lower Dens.

The band quickly released their first full-length album, Yoncalla, the following year. As opposed to the long-distance writing of the band's earlier releases, Yoncalla consisted of material that had been finished during tours for EP II. The majority of the album's final material was recorded in Paris, France, following an American tour that stopped by the city of Yoncalla, Oregon. The band produced the album at electronic musician Philippe Zdar's Motorbass studio in Paris, enabling them to achieve a sound more akin to classic synth-pop than their previous records.

After a year of heavy touring in support of Yoncalla, the band traveled home to record in New Zealand for the first time. A limited edition cover of the Oasis album (What's The Story) Morning Glory? was distributed on vinyl in early 2017, before the release of the band's second album, Willowbank, in October. The sessions for Willowbank marked the first time that the group had worked together in a professional studio, with the band initially questioning whether they should ""all move into separate rooms"" to recreate the remote songwriting process from previous records. However, the sessions allowed for stronger collaboration and more organic instrumentation compared to earlier material, leading to jazz musician Olivia Campion joining the band as a live drummer. The lead single ""Depths (Pt. I)"" became a success on streaming platforms, and was accompanied by a video created by illustrator Frances Haszard. Following the completion of touring for Willowbank, Perry left the band in order to concentrate on his Serbia-based musical project DOG Power.

In wake of the departure of Perry, the remaining four members of the band proceeded to return to the methods of long-distance writing that had inspired their earlier material. This process led to the creation of a third EP, released in October 2018. A video for the lead single ""In Camera"" was released in early 2019, directed by Pavel Brenner. A video for the second single ""Crush (It's Late, Just Stay)"" was also released in 2019, directed by Robbie Barnett.

After signing to Polyvinyl and Inertia Records, Yumi Zouma released their third studio album Truth or Consequences on March 13, 2020. The album features the singles ""Right Track / Wrong Man"", ""Cool For A Second"", ""Southwark"", ""Lonely After"", and ""Sage"". Along with the album, Yumi Zouma is set to release a unique line of merchandise which includes a candle, bandana, and enamel pin. The band announced a reimagined edition of the album named Truth or Consequences - Alternate Versions, which was released in October 2020.

On March 18, 2022, their fourth full-length release Present Tense was recorded remotely with some in-studio sessions in Los Angeles, London, Florence, New York, and New Zealand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Yumi+Zouma"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

139,139,car seat headrest,1117063,128336058,"Car Seat Headrest is an American indie rock band formed in Leesburg, Virginia, and currently located in Seattle, Washington. The band consists of Will Toledo (vocals, guitar, piano, and synthesizers), Ethan Ives (guitar, bass, backing vocals), Seth Dalby (bass), and Andrew Katz (drums, percussion).

Beginning as a solo recording project by Toledo in 2010, Car Seat Headrest self-released 12 albums on the music platform Bandcamp, before signing to Matador Records in 2015. Car Seat Headrest would begin touring as a full band the following year.

History
2010–2014: Lo-fi and solo releases, from 1 to How to Leave Town
Car Seat Headrest began as the solo project of singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Will Toledo (born William Barnes) shortly after he graduated high school. Toledo had previously released music under the alias Nervous Young Men, but after struggling to establish an audience, he decided to change tactics, choosing to try and release more experimental songs anonymously. Toledo chose the name ""Car Seat Headrest"" as he would often record the vocals to his early albums in the back seat of his car for privacy.

Throughout the summer of 2010, Toledo released his first four albums under the Car Seat Headrest name: 1, 2, 3, and 4. 1 and 2 incorporated less traditional song structures, with stream-of-consciousness lyrics, whereas 3 and 4 would begin to cement his lo-fi indie rock style. Following the numbered albums, Toledo began attending classes at Virginia Commonwealth University, releasing the Sunburned Shirts EP during his first semester. The Sunburned Shirts EP would later be partially combined with his fifth LP, 5, to create his first titled album, My Back Is Killing Me Baby, released in March 2011. Songs culled from 5 would later appear on the b-sides compilation album Little Pieces of Paper with ""No"" Written on Them.

After a difficult and lonely semester at VCU, Toledo transferred to the College of William & Mary, where he would release his next project, Twin Fantasy, a concept album centered on a relationship he was in at the time. Twin Fantasy would later be followed up by 2012's Monomania and Starving While Living EP.

Around this time, Toledo began performing live shows with fellow students Katie Wood, Austin Ruhf, and Christian Northover, recording and releasing a short live album in July 2013 entitled Live at WCWM: Car Seat Headrest at the university's studio. Toledo would release his next project the following month; a two-hour long double album entitled Nervous Young Man. Three of the songs, and the title of the album, were taken from his original project, Nervous Young Men, but had been heavily reworked and re-recorded. Released alongside Nervous Young Man, for those who paid $5 or more, was the outtakes compilation album Disjecta Membra.

Toledo's final solo release was 2014's How to Leave Town, an hour long EP with heavy electronic instrumentation and more ambitious song structures.

2015–2017: Matador Records, Teens of Style and Teens of Denial
Ethan Ives.
In September 2015, Car Seat Headrest announced on Facebook that he had signed an album deal with Matador Records. Toledo, who had recently graduated and moved to Seattle, recruited bassist Jacob Bloom and drummer Andrew Katz through Craigslist to record and tour his next album. In October 2015, Car Seat Headrest released the compilation album Teens of Style, their first to not be self-released exclusively via Bandcamp. Shortly after the album's release, Bloom left the group to attend medical school, and was replaced by bassist Ethan Ives.

Ives played bass throughout most of the recordings for the band's following release, but would later switch to guitar and other instruments, with Seth Dalby taking over on bass. Ives and Dalby were later cemented in these positions during live shows and future releases. The new album, created with traditional studio processes, Teens of Denial, was released on May 20, 2016. The album received universal acclaim, and brought the band a new wave of popularity.

In 2017, Car Seat Headrest released an alternate mix of their single, ""War Is Coming (If You Want It)"" through Bandcamp for one day, with profits going to the Transgender Law Center. The original mix of the track was released ten days later.

On December 13, 2017, the band released a re-recorded version of ""Beach Life-In-Death"", the second track on Twin Fantasy, through Spotify without prior announcement. This sparked fan rumors that the album would be re-recorded and released the following year. On December 27, 2017, an Amazon listing detailing a re-recorded version of Twin Fantasy was found by fans, and subsequently uploaded to the Car Seat Headrest subreddit. This was followed up by a listing on SRCVinyl.com with the date February 16, 2018. 

2018–2019: Twin Fantasy (Face to Face) and Commit Yourself Completely
On January 9, 2018, Matador Records formally announced the release of the re-recording, entitled Twin Fantasy (Face to Face), alongside a re-release of the original album. Twin Fantasy (Face to Face) was released via Matador on February 16. The original, which has been re-titled Twin Fantasy (Mirror to Mirror), was released on vinyl as a part of Record Store Day on April 21. On February 15, 2018, the band released a cover of ""Fallen Horses"" by Smash Mouth, who returned the favor by covering ""Something Soon"". Around the same time, they began touring with fellow Seattle-based band, Naked Giants, as a part of the group's expanded live lineup.

In August 2018, when asked about new material, Toledo confirmed that he was “demoing out stuff in Ableton,” adding “there might be some stuff that surprises people who only know us as a rock band, but I don’t think it will come as a surprise to people who are checking out all the deep cuts.” In January 2019, Andrew Katz confirmed the band was recording new music through a video uploaded on Instagram.

Following the tease of new music, the band began experimenting with new material at various live shows in December 2018, debuting the tracks ""Weightlifters"", ""Hollywood"", ""Stop Lying To Me"", and ""You Know There's Someone Out There"", soon followed by ""Can't Cool Me Down"" in February and March 2019 performances. All were officially released on the next album except for ""Stop Lying To Me"" and ""You Know There's Someone Out There"".

On June 12, 2019, Car Seat Headrest announced a new live album titled Commit Yourself Completely, featuring official recordings of performances from the Twin Fantasy tour from 2018. It was released the following week on June 17.

2020–present: Making a Door Less Open
On February 26, 2020, Car Seat Headrest announced their first studio album consisting of wholly new material since 2016's Teens of Denial, Making a Door Less Open. This announcement coincided with the release of ""Can't Cool Me Down"", the first single and second track off the album, and a release date of May 1, 2020. It marks a stylistic divergence from previous material, Toledo describing the album as containing elements of EDM, hip hop, futurism, doo-wop, soul and rock and roll. Three more singles were released to promote the album between March and April of that year: ""Martin"", ""Hollywood"" and ""There Must Be More Than Blood"". The release also coincided with the introduction of Trait, an alternative persona of Toledo's, featured prominently wearing a modified gas mask with blinking LED lights for eyes. The character had originally been created for the group's ""comedic"" side project, 1 Trait Danger, featuring Toledo alongside drummer Andrew Katz.

Making a Door Less Open was released with three separate versions across different formats: vinyl, CD and streaming, each with variations in track-list and specific musical elements. The album received a mixed reaction from fans, which pointed out the many divergences from the band's previous works, but received an overall score of 77 on review aggregate site Metacritic. Toledo noted that he and the band were working on a companion album for their latest release, while also looking for ways to improve the Trait mask to incorporate it into live performances.

Style
AllMusic biographer Mark Deming wrote that Car Seat Headrest created ""moody and introspective lo-fi pop tunes that are melodic but structurally ambitious at once."" Writing for Pitchfork, Jeremy Gordon stated that on Teens of Denial, ""Will Toledo reaffirms that he is ahead of the pack as an imaginative singer-songwriter, capable of crafting dynamic indie rock."" Ian Cohen of Pitchfork also described Toledo's music as ""dense, confounding music that most often captures the giddy thrill of having access to recording equipment, of finally put a sound to the voice in your head.""

Car Seat Headrest's influences include Radiohead, Pink Floyd, the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Daniel Johnston, Destroyer, Kendrick Lamar, Frank Ocean, Leonard Cohen, of Montreal, Modest Mouse, Neutral Milk Hotel, Sufjan Stevens, Swans, They Might Be Giants, Why?, R.E.M., the Who, Nirvana, the Blackout, Neil Diamond, William Onyeabor, the Clash, the Cars, James Brown, DEVO, Queen, Rod Stewart, and Green Day. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Car+Seat+Headrest"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

142,142,tyler childers,448199,25514889,"Tyler Childers (born June 21, 1991) is an American singer and songwriter. His music is a mix of country, bluegrass and folk. He released his breakthrough album Purgatory in August 2017. Childers released his third and most recent LP, Country Squire, via his own Hickman Holler Records, under exclusive license to RCA Records in August 2019. 

Tyler Childers was born and raised in Lawrence County, Kentucky. His father worked in the coal industry and his mother is a nurse. He learned singing in church where he sang in the church choir. He started to play guitar and write songs when he was around 13. He moved from Lawrence County to Paintsville, Kentucky, where he attended Paintsville High School and graduated in 2009. Fellow country musicians Chris Stapleton and Loretta Lynn (Van Lear, KY) also hail from Paintsville. He studied for a semester at Western Kentucky University, and enrolled at Bluegrass Community and Technical College for a few semesters. He dropped out of college and did odd jobs for some time while pursuing a music career.

Childers began performing in Lexington, Kentucky and Huntington, West Virginia. In 2011, when he was 19, Childers released his first album, Bottles And Bibles. He has also released two EPs recorded in 2013 at Red Barn Radio, a radio show from Lexington. The two EPs were later released as one after the success of his album Purgatory, and reached No. 5 on Heatseekers Albums.

He had his first success with Purgatory, a breakthrough album released on August 4, 2017. The album was produced by Sturgill Simpson and David Ferguson and recorded at The Butcher Shoppe in Nashville. Simpson also played guitar and sang backing vocals on the album, with Miles Miller on drums, Stuart Duncan on fiddle and Russ Paul on other instruments. It debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums chart, No. 17 on the Country albums chart and No. 4 on the Americana/Folk albums chart. In September 2018, Childers won Emerging Artist of the Year at the 2018 Americana Music Honors & Awards, where he gave an acceptance speech noted for its criticism of the Americana genre label, saying that ""as a man who identifies as a country music singer, I feel Americana ain't no part of nothing and is a distraction from the issues that we're facing on a bigger level as country music singers. It kind of feels like purgatory.""

Country Squire, a second album under the Hickman Holler label, and Childers' third overall, was released on August 2, 2019, after being announced in May 2019. This album was again produced by Simpson and Ferguson. The video of the lead single from the album ""House Fire"" was also released on May 16, 2019.

Childers' music is influenced by his home state of Kentucky and its connection to country music and bluegrass. He often writes about coal mining, which was his father's occupation, and its effects. Rebecca Bengal, writing for The Guardian, described Childers' songs as a ""counternarrative to the outsiders who seek to perpetuate stereotypes of backwardness and poverty."" Childers emphasizes lyrical content in songs, comparing the songwriting process to telling short stories. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tyler+Childers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In May 2020, Parks released the singles Eugene and Black Dog, which were well received during the COVID-19 lockdown, the latter of which became BBC Radio 1's Tune of the Week.

With over 60 million streams on Spotify alone, countless sold-out headline shows across the US, and tours with Mt.

Career
Within a year of formation, Beach House charmed indie music enthusiasts across the blogosphere with their languid songcraft, while the eerie warmth of ""Apple Orchard"" landed on Pitchfork's Infinite Mixtape MP3 series in August 2006. Two months later, they issued their eponymous debut album for Carpark. Fall shows with labelmates Over the Atlantic were also scheduled. Victoria can also be heard on Frenemies' Birds in High School album.  She and Chris Freeland created harmonies on the song ""Waiting for the Ambulance"". Victoria can also be heard on Grizzly Bear's 2009 release Veckatimest and she sings on ""Slow Life"", a Grizzly Bear track featured on the official soundtrack for Twilight: New Moon.

In September of 2009, Sub Pop Records announced that Beach House had signed and that a follow up album to 2008's Devotion, Teen Dream, would be released in early 2010. The album received universal acclaim from contemporary music critics, additionally hailed as one of the best albums of 2010. Their fourth studio album, Bloom, was released on May 15, 2012, as their second release with Sub Pop. Released to further acclaim from music critics, it was supported by the lead single ""Myth"", with the album debuting at number seven on the US Billboard 200 album chart.

Following the success of Bloom, Beach House began recording their fifth album, Depression Cherry (2015), in November 2014.  Earlier that year, the group contributed to Lefse Records' compliation album The Space Project, with the track  Saturn Song.

Depression Cherry was released on August 28, 2015, and debuted at number eight on the US Billboard 200 album chart. Two months after its release, the group announced that they would release their sixth studio album, Thank Your Lucky Stars (2015), later that same year, adding that it is ""not a companion to Depression Cherry, or a surprise, or b-sides"".

After releasing those two albums in 2015, Beach House announced that a compilation album, B-Sides and Rarities (2017), would be released in 2017 as a way of ""cleaning out the closet"" to pave the way for a new creative process. It was released on June 30, 2017, containing two unreleased tracks and other ""rare"" tracks. The next year, the band announced their seventh studio album, 7 (2018) and released four singles to promote it; ""Lemon Glow"", ""Dive"", ""Dark Spring"" and ""Black Car"". 7 was released on May 11, 2018, and was co-produced by Sonic Boom (alias of Peter Kember), singer and guitarist of Spacemen 3.

160,160,cocteau twins,1831819,118178673,"Cocteau Twins were a Scottish band active from 1979 to 1997. They were formed in Grangemouth by Robin Guthrie (guitars, drum machine) and Will Heggie (bass), adding Elizabeth Fraser (vocals) in 1981 and replacing Heggie with multi-instrumentalist Simon Raymonde in 1983. The group earned critical praise for their ethereal, effects-laden sound and the soprano vocals of Fraser, whose lyrics often eschew any recognisable language. They pioneered the 1980s alternative rock subgenre of dream pop.

The band's early work drew influence from Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division. After signing with the British record label 4AD in 1982, they released their debut album Garlands later that year. The addition of Raymonde in 1983 solidified their final lineup, which produced their biggest hit in the UK, ""Pearly-Dewdrops' Drops"", peaking at No. 29 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1988, Cocteau Twins signed with Capitol Records in the United States, distributing their fifth album, Blue Bell Knoll, through a major label in the country. After the 1990 release of their most critically acclaimed album, Heaven or Las Vegas, the band left 4AD for Fontana Records, where they released their final two albums.

After nearly 20 years together, the band disbanded in 1997 in part due to issues stemming from the disintegration of Fraser and Guthrie's romantic relationship. In 2005, the band announced that they would reunite to headline Coachella and embark on a world tour but the reunion was cancelled a month later after Fraser refused to perform on stage with Guthrie. In a 2021 interview, Raymonde confirmed that Cocteau Twins ""will never reform"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cocteau+Twins"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

161,161,bilk,94453,927855,"There are at least three bands named Bilk:

1. an indie/punk band from Essex, U.K. (début: 2018)
2. a band from Zagreb, Croatia
3. a 'neo-Neue Deutsche Welle' band from Berlin, Germany

1. The raw and real sounds of the trio Bilk (from Essex, United Kingdom) sets new standard for guitar music in England with a unique blend of indie, rap and punk. First singles (2018): 'Give Up' and 'Spiked'.

2. BILK were formed in Zagreb, Croatia in 1999. The line-up was unstable for years, until it got reduced to the steady and dedicated base: Tin Oberman, Janko Novoselic, Luka Vrbanic are young students of architecture, music and medicine and they use their crafts and gifts fully, building their sound with surgery precision.

With people joining and leaving the band, BILK went through many phases and music styles and this experience broadened their musical horizons. They recorded a few demos, played many shows and appeared on some music competitions like the Heineken Music Fest Live (2003) in Travnik and Zenica, BIH where they simply came and won and the Newcomer 2005 festival in Graz, Austria where they also made first prize.

Soon thereafter Mr. Moonlee proposed them a record deal. BILK went to the legendary Kozmo Studio in Zagreb and recorded their debut album called This Bilk is Radioactive which was released by Moonlee Records with Marko Pelaic as producer.

Their heuristic approach enabled them to produce a brilliant album featuring a sound unheard in this area before. The groove, coming out of their drums, bass, synthesizers and guitar is built from various music styles melted into a breakbeat mass of pure positive energy, melodies and beats.

3. Bilk from Berlin, Germany, find themselves in a triangle between punk, rock and pop, where a little influence of the 80th century music, especially the Neue Deutsche Welle' (NDW), which can't (and won't) be denied and they consider with a critical view what is important in the world: life, love and the passion with wich things can be done and unfairness wich cannot be overlooked.

They present their knowledge in a wide range from loud and rough to harmonic and pensive in their native tongue without falling into the trap of presenting trash or phrasemongering.

2)  Heroes of the modern garage revival, the Wombats were born sometime in the late 70s, somewhere in the leafy lanes of Maple Heights, Ohio. Teenage guitar strangler John Zinrich, a.k.a. Johnny Fettish (so called because he had a thing for biting women's knees under tables, hence ""John Knee Fetish""), had previously lived out the punk ideal by dropping out of high school at age 15 to join Public Enemy, noted in Cle 3.0 for doing ""the fastest version ever attempted of 'I Wanna Be Your Dog'."" Striving for a poppier sound, Fettish and his suburban neighbor Vic Halm penned a series of power-punk pop gems and entered the first national ""Battle of the Garages"" competition run by Bomp/Voxx honcho Greg Shaw. The 'Bats contributed a track, ""The Reason Why"" to the first ""Battle"" compilation and played on the national ""Battle"" tour in 1981. Positive public reaction won them a recording contract, and between 1981 and 1984 the 'Bats released two singles and an album, ""Zontar Must Die!"" on Bomp/Voxx. They also played various notable East Coast and local venues, including the first WRUW Studio Arama show and the opening night of the Lakefront (which displayed ""Wombats"" on its curb sign for several years as a result). Their energetic live show was notable for speedy fuzzy guitars pumped through Marshall stacks, unintelligible vocals, and the sight of 5'4"" Fettish leaping two feet in the air, against a backdrop of six-foot-tall John Lennon-lookalike Halm and equally towering bassist Tim Ratley. In 1984 the Wombats played a show with the seminal Columbus band Great Plains, who brought them to the attention of Gerard Cosloy at Homestead Records. The Wombats subsequently recorded one EP for Homestead, ""Mudpuddles"", which came out in 1985. Unfortunately, the band had a falling out with Cosloy over their inability to tour, since drummer Tommy Edwards was busy studying to be a refrigerator repairman. As a result, promotion for ""Mudpuddles"" was almost nil and the 'Bats found themselves once again without a label. In 1986, Fettish and Halm wrote and recorded some excellent demos for a third album which they hoped to place on a major label, but due to lack of interest this project never saw the light of day. Since then, the 'Bats have played sporadically around Cleveland with various lineups. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Wombats"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

166,166,the warning,146106,6034173,"There are multiple artists tracked on this page. 

1) The Warning are a rock band originating from Monterrey, Mexico. The band was formed in 2013 by the Villarreal Vélez sisters: Daniela (guitar, lead and backing vocals, piano), Paulina (drums, lead and backing vocals, piano), and Alejandra (bass guitar, piano, backing vocals). They have released four studio albums, two EPs, and eight music videos. Their latest studio album, Keep Me Fed, was released on June 28th, 2024.

The Villarreal Vélez sisters were raised in Monterrey, and all received training on various instruments at an early age. At some point in their childhood, Daniela and Paulina had selected guitar and drums as their primary instruments, respectively. When the youngest of the three, Alejandra, selected bass guitar as her primary instrument at about age 7, the sisters decided to form a rock power trio in 2013. They learned to play rock songs, often via the Rock Band video game series, and posted videos of their performances on YouTube.

In 2014, 12-year-old Paulina was profiled in the women's drumming publication Tom Tom Magazine. The band first gained widespread notice later in 2014 when, at ages 9 through 14, their YouTube video in which they performed Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"" went viral among rock music fans, eventually earning more than 20 million views. The video received attention from Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett, who offered particular praise for Paulina, saying, ""The drummer kicks maximum ass!""

Due to notice gained from their ""Enter Sandman"" video, The Warning decided to seek a record deal and develop their songs. They raised money through a successful GoFundMe appeal to record the six-song EP Escape the Mind, which was released in 2015. During the production of the EP, the band met producer Jake Carmona, who went on to contribute to Escape the Mind and their next three albums. In April 2015, the band appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. During this period the sisters raised funds, including a donation from DeGeneres and the Target Corporation, to attend a five-week training program at Berklee College of Music in the United States.

They also gave two presentations at the TEDx conference at the University of Nevada in 2016 and 2017.[17][18] The band was known for practicing with the Rock Band video game series early in their history; designers returned the favor by including several songs by The Warning in the 2018 edition of the series.[19][20]

The Warning's first full-length album, XXI Century Blood, was released in 2017. During this period they were invited to perform at the Mother of All Rock Festival in Monterrey and also opened a show for The Killers in that city. Their second album Queen of the Murder Scene was released in November 2018. They announced an extensive upcoming tour throughout North America in late 2019, though it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In August 2020, The Warning signed a five-album deal with Lava Records, and began work on a new album with producer David Bendeth. The song ""Choke"" was released in May 2021. Later that year, The Warning appeared on the Metallica tribute album The Metallica Blacklist, performing another cover of ""Enter Sandman"", this time with singer Alessia Cara. The six-song EP Mayday was released in October 2021, and The Warning embarked on a tour of North America in early 2022, performing more than 30 dates as headliners plus opening for Foo Fighters, Sammy Hagar and the Circle, and Stone Temple Pilots. They released the single ""Money"" in March 2022, and the song reached no. 31 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Airplay chart. The full-length album Error, comprising the six tracks from the Mayday EP plus ""Money"" and seven new songs, was released in June 2022. In July 2022, they embarked on a U.S. tour supporting Halestorm and The Pretty Reckless and appearing at festivals like Burlington's Sound of Music Festival, Iceberg Alley, Summerfest, and Upheaval, before resuming their headlining tour in August 2022. In the Fall of 2022, The Warning performed at additional festivals (Louder Than Life, Aftershock, Peninsula Tecate, Rock al Parque), supported a second US tour with Halestorm, a Canada tour with Three Days Grace, a Guns N' Roses tour stop in their home city of Monterrey, Mexico, and performed small-venue concerts in Las Vegas, California, and Lima, Peru. The band supported Muse during several dates on the Will of the People World Tour in both Mexico and Europe. In September 2023, they opened for Guns N' Roses again on two dates of the We're F'N' Back! Tour. In early 2024, the band announced on social media that their fourth studio album Keep Me Fed will be released in June 2024. In March 2024 three new singles from the upcoming album were released: ""S!CK"", ""Hell You Call a Dream"" and ""Que Mas Quieres"".

Their biggest musical influences are Overkill, Annihilator, Megadeth, Testament, Running Wild and Savatage.

The band plays their music with a 'wink'. This means that they want to play their songs as good as possible, but they need some humour. So don't expect them to look like 'evil' people standing still, quietly playing music on stage.
The band-members are having fun in making metal and thy try to make a party of every gig. This is their main ingredient for a good gig, maybe that's why they already have some big fans...

It Lives disbanded in 2006

170,170,vendredi sur mer,363287,5269997,"From Geneva, Switzerland, although her nationality is usually defined as Franco-Swiss. Her name is Charline Mignot, but artistically she is known as Vendredi sur Mer.

Coming into the world in the mid 90's, Charline grows up with a very introverted view of the world around her. As she grew up and wanted to explain her surroundings in her own way, she moved more and more towards the arts, fashion and photography, and it is in the latter that she dedicated her studies.

In his quest to make his own mark and push his own boundaries within the aesthetics he used for his photographs, he eventually started writing songs. The first time was with the idea of using self-made music for her photo shoots, knowing that music would help set the mood within the shoot. That's how her first song, ""Est-ce que tu t'en souviens"", was created.

Their style is quite distinctive, having been described as dream-pop, electro-pop, electro-ambient and even ""space-disco"". The marriage of Charline's art and direction caught the attention of Swiss and French producers, including Lewis Ofman, who produced her most listened-to single, ""La femme á la peau bleue"", in 2016, a song that became famous in the fashion world as the official music for one of Sonia Rykiel's 2017 collections.

Mignot's voice is always soft, as if she were singing from a reverie. She uses a spoken voice in all her songs, which come across best as storytelling about women, sensuality, love and heartbreak. In some interviews she has expressed frustration at being associated with radical feminism just because her music is about women, ""as if it's something abnormal or radicalised for a woman to write about women instead of men"", so she often says that she goes between one gender and the other, to create confusion among listeners.

Vendredi sur Mer's first EP came out in 2017 and is called ""Marée basse"", the only studio album she has released to date is called ""Premiers émois"" and was released in 2019 with the single ""Chewing-Gum"".

Do you like women who make music independently and maintain a beautiful aesthetic to match their creations and their music videos?

Eddy and Small Crush.[21][22] On September 27, they released the sixth single, ""Soundproof"", from their second album ""Make Room"", for which they announced the information at the same time.[23] ""Make Room"" was released on October 19, 2018,[23] with Joey Armstrong and Chris Malaspina sharing drum duties and Cole Becker and Enzo Malaspina sharing bass duties.[24]

Despite their frequent comparisons to riot grrrl bands like Bikini Kill, the members of the band deny any associations with it, saying that they love the genre, but they shouldn't be categorized as it just because they're female-fronted.[33]

174,174,unknown mortal orchestra,1035226,30830339,"Unknown Mortal Orchestra (UMO) is a New Zealand psychedelic rock band formed in Auckland and currently based in Portland, Oregon, USA. Primarily composed of singer, guitarist, and songwriter Ruban Nielson, and bassist Jacob Portrait, the band was started by Nielson in 2010. The band's debut album was released in 2011 on Fat Possum Records. In November 2013, the band's second album, II, won Best Alternative Album at the New Zealand Music Awards. 

In late 2010 the band's bandcamp account featured their single ‘Ffunny Ffrends’, a sort of alien beatnik pop music that echoed 60s psychedelia and krautrock minimalism with just a hint of gentle weirdness that suggested its roots might equally lie in the verdant indie of the equally distant New Zealand scene.

Ruban Nielson is a New Zealand native who transplanted to Portland, Oregon, USA with his band The Mint Chicks. UMO was a project conceived as Ruban’s escape hatch to a new musical dimension where his vision of junkshop record collector pop could be realised in a sound that recalled Captain Beefheart, Sly Stone and RZA jamming on some kids TV theme too dark to ever be broadcast.

The eponymous UMO debut album was released in 2011 on Fat Possum Records, followed by II (2013), Multi-Love (2015), Sex & Food (2018), IC-01 Hanoi (2018) and V (2023). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Unknown+Mortal+Orchestra"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His music also caught the attention of songwriters such as Dan Wilson known for his work with Adele, Scott Harris, Carrie Underwood, among others. Kahan deferred his admission to Tulane University to pursue his developing music career. Kahan has said that two career goals he wished for were to be verified on Instagram and to have a Wikipedia page.

Kahan cites some of his inspirations as Paul Simon, Cat Stevens, Counting Crows, Hozier, and Mumford and Sons.

""Cape Elizabeth"" was then released on May 1, 2020.

On June 17, 2021 Kahan announced his second full-length album titled ""I Was/I Am"". Five days later he announced the ""I Was/I Am"" tour. On September 17, 2021, the album was released.

Kahan followed it up with the release of ""Northern Attitude"" on September 16.

On October 14, 2022, Kahan released his album Stick Season. According to early reviews of the album from AP News, ""There’s irony there because these feel like songs both longtime listeners and newer fans will want to belt back to Kahan — not because they’re produced for stadiums or arenas, but because they’re full of nostalgic melodies that will resonate far beyond New England."" Kahan wrote this album during the pandemic which he spent back home in Vermont. Stick Season leans more into the folk genre than the rest of his older music which were more pop sounding. Kahan says that in his album, Stick Season, he wanted to pay homage to the folk singers that he grew up listening to. He adds that his greatest goal as a songwriter is to write music that other people can relate to and to be able to throw that lifeline to someone.

On March 17, 2023, Kahan was featured on Joy Oladokun's single ""We're All Gonna Die"", which was also released as part of her April 2023 album, Proof of Life.

On June 9, 2023, Kahan released a deluxe version of Stick Season titled, Stick Season (We'll All Be Here Forever), which includes seven previously unreleased tracks. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Noah+Kahan"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Their debut album Becoming a Jackal was released in 2010 and was shortlisted for that year's Mercury Prize and their second album {Awayland} was released in 2013.

Conor O'Brien formed Villagers after the break-up of his previous band The Immediate. The very next day, O'Brien wrote the first song after waking up with a hangover. O'Brien's time as a guitarist in Cathy Davey's band was also critical to the development of his style as he had never before performed alongside anyone outside of The Immediate. Villagers gave their first live performance as a support act with The Chapters at a show in Whelan's in November 2008. At that point the band had previously only rehearsed together on two occasions. They had only seven songs, written by O'Brien and passed on to the rest of the band to learn.

Villagers performed on the seventh series of RTÉ Two's Other Voices television programme in 2009. The band's debut EP, titled Hollow Kind, was released in February 2009. It contained four tracks, all of which were written by O'Brien and performed by him too. The EP brought comparisons with Bright Eyes and Sparklehorse. Villagers then went on tour. They were a support act for Neil Young and toured across Europe with Tracy Chapman.

Villagers appeared at several festivals in 2009. They supported Bell X1 when they performed at Live at the Marquee in Cork on June 26, 2009. They performed at several music festivals in Ireland, including on the Sunday of Oxegen 2009, at Indie-pendence on August 2 and at Electric Picnic 2009, as well as at Latitude Festival in the UK. The Irish Times's Jim Carroll recommended their performance in the Body Soul Arena at Electric Picnic 2009 as ""A must-see for those who dig ragged pop, eerie folk and heartfelt, emotional songs and sounds"". They headlined Hard Working Class Heroes in 2009, with O'Brien attracting the ire of the audience when he requested some quiet during the performance. They gave a live performance at The Music Show in Dublin's RDS in October 2009.

The debut single of Villagers was ""On a Sunlit Stage"" and was released in October 2009.
On January 15, 2010, Villagers represented Ireland at the Eurosonic Festival in Groningen, the Netherlands. They were involved in efforts to raise funds in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. They embarked on a tour with Tindersticks in March 2010 and released the single ""Becoming a Jackal"" on April 17, 2010. A debut album Becoming a Jackal was released in Ireland on 14 May 2010, with a UK release in May and a US release due on 8 June 2010. The album immediately went to number one on both the Irish Albums Chart and the Irish Indie Albums Chart. It proceeded to continuously top the indie chart.

Said by Conor J. O’Brien himself: 
- “Ultimately, I’ve learned that a song is not an isolated thing. You have to wash the dishes before you write a song. It should never be taken too seriously. It must be treated with joy and humour, regardless of the subject matter,” muses Conor, as he strokes his hairless chin.
- “The aim is to feel the songs out. If I don’t surprise myself, then it is a worthless endeavour. Indeed, I would apply this attitude to all aspects of this project. The songs are quite decisive, but I have no idea what I am doing, or where I am going.” Again, he strokes his chin, this time with a look of resigned confusion. “Once the songs took shape, I asked some friends of mine to help me play them to people. When they kindly agreed, I decided that we would present ourselves as ‘Villagers’ – I don’t really know why. I think I like the name because it doesn’t offend the songs.” With this, he puts his clothes back on and bids me farewell. On returning to my office, I slip on a banana peel and subsequently die. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Villagers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

181,181,baynk,319613,4194001,"Pushing beyond his playlist origins, the New Zealand producer’s debut album revels in eccentric details while adhering to traditional pop structures. Like so many electronic artists in the mid-’10s, New Zealand’s BAYNK (Jock Nowell-Usticke) got his start making chill, pop-adjacent songs that seemed primed for placement in mood-based playlists. His early attempts at surf-bro EDM sounded like what Kygo and LeMarquis were putting out on SoundCloud at the time; he used his voice sparingly, mainly as material to be sampled. In the years since, though, he has refined his palette. On 2017’s Someone’s EP I and 2019’s Someone’s EP II, his percussion took on the rhythmic impulse of Four Tet, and his rubbery basslines and glossy experimentalism were reminiscent of early Cashmere Cat and Flume. Using his Auto-Tuned falsetto to further texturize his songs, BAYNK’s fusion of house, R&B, and pop soon set him apart from the many similar acts scattered throughout the scene.

Adolescence is BAYNK’s most meticulous work to date. It revels in eccentric, distinctive details while adhering to traditional pop structures. Most arrangements consist of grainy synth loops, plucky subs, and house-inspired drums; his digital sounds are drenched in reverb and slapped with sidechain. On the Cosmo’s Midnight-assisted “How Does it Feel?” languid synth pulses and a funky bassline give way to some of the sharpest vocal melodies on the album. “Remember,” which features Rainsford, exhibits BAYNK’s talent for peeling a heavily layered song back to its component parts before climaxing into an ecstatic yet graceful drop. This is dance music for headphones, club music for late-night walks.

The best songs on Adolescence bend toward straightforward pop formulas and, tellingly, include non-electronic instruments. “Mine” is led by quiet piano and spacey guitar, while standout “Naked” blends acoustic elements and electric bass with shimmering synths. BAYNK gives his best vocal performances here: “Get caught up on trying to pin you down/Your fingers ’round my neck, they’re feeling soft now,"" he coos on “Naked,” evoking the warm upper register of Whitney’s Julien Ehrlich. He’s not a great singer, as Tinashe makes plain when she steals the show on “Esther”; he scrubs clean his imperfections with layers of automation, delay, and reverb. Still, BAYNK has a keen ear for melody and knows his limits, wisely ceding the mic to guests while he works the boards.

The album is nominally a concept record about the immediacy of youth and romantic first experiences. “I went through this period of not being able to write anything,” BAYNK told Apple Music. Being in a “stable and happy relationship” wasn’t conducive to inspiration, so to get around his writer’s block, he returned to the creative cocoon of “first love.” Lyrically, the album is imagistic and vague, depicting half-baked scenes of lying in the sun, holding hands in a car, and walking through fields. The narrative never coalesces into anything meaningful, and its emotional pull wanes quickly. First love invigorates but rarely sustains; it’s BAYNK’s elastic and original production that propels the album forward, the pulse of the beat begging us to feel something beyond recognition. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/BAYNK"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

182,182,ben mazué,76171,1297713,"Ben Mazue was born to a French teacher and an architect. He entered the music conservatory to study piano. Throughout his childhood, he and his parents lived in Biot and moved to the capital, Paris, in the following years. As a teenager, he decided to stay and settle in Paris while his parents returned to the south of France to Biot.

In addition to his piano studies, he also took courses in medicine. At the end of his various studies, he decided to take up music at the age of 25. In love with the knowledge of rap and soul music, he started to compose and to multiply his experiences as well as his friendships.

With his friend Augustin, Ben Mazue performed for a while as a duo in the bars of the capital and then went on to form a group called La Plage for at least three years. This is how he got the taste for performing on the city's stages and did not stop touring at the first opportunity.

Ben Mazue: an artist with a successful career
Ben Mazué won the Prix de la Découverte de la Sacem at the Festival Jacques Brel de Vesoul 2006. He also won the Paris Young Talent Award in June 2008 and the FAIR in 2010. He then performed a series of shows as the opening act for Anis, Tété and Hocus Pocus. Ben Mazué has also given numerous concerts on his own, notably at the Printemps de Bourges and Francofolies festivals.

He has released several albums, including Common Ground, his first 5-track album, released in 2007. Then, at the end of 2010, he released his second album with the help of guitarists Clément Simounet, Régis Ceccarelli and Jean-Pierre Sluys. Ben Mazué has also signed a contract with Columbia Label, a subsidiary of Sony Music. His first album was released in October 2011.

He released his track Confession, from his rap albums, Addicts and Mes Monuments as a single. The third single from the album, ""C'est Léger"", is sung with singer Pauline Croze. Ben Mazué has had several tours in France. In 2020, he released Paradis, his fourth album, which recounts the summary of his life in the wake of his separation.

Indeed, it is an album that also refers to the island of Reunion, which he affectionately calls his Paradise on Earth. Finally, during the years 2020 and 2021, he becomes with his song Quand je marche, the winner of the Charles Cros prize, one of the high school students of the ACC.

Discover Ben Mazue's news and what he is up to in 2022
Since the release of his excellent album Paradis, Ben Mazué's reputation has grown in a matter of weeks. Most of those who know him since then, as well as those who have just discovered him, are waiting to see his next concert. In terms of current events, the artist is preparing a concert for his public by June, certainly in the fall of 2022.

In the spring season of 2022, that is to say on 23 March, the Zenith will be visited and more precisely in Rennes. The city of Lille is not on the sidelines and will be hosting Ben Mazue on 30 March. The city of Rouen will follow suit by hosting the artist on 04 April. The renowned artist Ben Mazué will arrive in Nantes on 05 April, in Paris on 8 April and will finish in Lyon on 13 April 2022.

So, if you want to see Ben Mazue in concert near you, you have all the chances on your side. You can check out all the dates listed above and book your tickets. Recently, the artist made a video in Reunion Island where he tells in a very special way how his songs became successful.

What is Ben Mazue's style of music?
Ben Mazue is without doubt the surprise of the contemporary rap world. This young man from Biot was not destined to be a rapper. However, it was when he arrived in Paris with his parents that he discovered it. It is through this style of music that he tries to drown his feelings on paper that he accompanies with rap music. His music has been influenced by the famous Alain Souchon, Renaud and Jacques Brel.

The essence of his music comes from rap, but also from African music and American soul. These different influences place him at the crossroads between grand slam, rap, soul music and reggae. In 2011, Ben Mazué made his name on the scene with his first album. It is an autobiographical album that raises awareness and shows that taking care of oneself means taking care of others.

Over the years, the artist has made a name for himself through his art and his desire to impact the world through his melodies. As a result, rapper Ben Mazué has become one of the icons of rap music in Europe and even worldwide.

185,185,cat power,2048076,75082026,"Cat Power is American singer, songwriter, musician, occasional actress, and model. Charlyn Marie Marshall (also known as Chan, pronounced ""Shawn"")  was born in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. on 21 January 1972. Cat Power was originally the name of Marshall's first band, but has become her stage name as a solo artist.

After dropping out of high school, Marshall started performing under the name Cat Power, while in Atlanta, backed by musicians Glen Thrasher, Mark Moore, and others. She soon moved to New York City, New York, United States in 1992, then later opening for Liz Phair in 1994, she met Steve Shelley of Sonic Youth and Tim Foljahn of Two Dollar Guitar, who encouraged her to record, and played on her first two albums, 1995's Dear Sir and 1996's Myra Lee. In 1996 she was signed to Matador Records, and released her third album, What Would the Community Think, which spawned a single and music video, ""Nude as the News"".

Shortly following the release of What Would the Community Think Marshall disappeared from the musical scene, initially working as a baby sitter in Portland, Oregon and then moving to a farmhouse in Prosperity, South Carolina with boyfriend Bill Callahan (who performs under the name Smog). The plan was to permanently retire from music but during a sleepless night resulting from a nightmare, Marshall wrote several new songs. These songs would make up the bulk of Moon Pix. The album was recorded at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne in eleven days with backing musicians Mick Turner and Jim White of the Dirty Three. The album was well-received by critics, and gained her recognition in the indie rock scene. However, during the subsequent tours she grew tired of her own material. This resulted in a series of shows during 1999 involving Marshall providing musical accompaniment to a series of screenings of the silent movie The Passion of Joan of Arc. The shows combined original material and many covers, many of which would later see release on The Covers Record, a collection of cover songs recorded at various sessions in 1998 and 1999. A selection of covers that didn't make it on to the album were recorded at Peel Acres, home of the highly influential and legendary British DJ John Peel. The session was broadcast on his BBC Radio 1 show and featured Marshall's own interpretations of Bob Dylan's ""Hard Times in New York Town"" amongst others.

In 2003 she resumed releasing original material with You Are Free, a diverse and critically acclaimed album that featured guest musicians such as Eddie Vedder, Dave Grohl, and the Dirty Three's Warren Ellis.

2004 saw the release of Speaking for Trees, a critically polarizing DVD which featured a single two-hour static shot of Marshall performing in a woodland. It was accompanied by an audio CD containing the 18-minute song ""Willie Deadwilder"", which featured M. Ward on guitar. 2005 found Cat Power out on the road again, touring the world and playing sold-out solo shows, including an Australian tour supporting Nick Cave. The shows largely consisted of material for her next album.

Cat Power's seventh record, The Greatest, was released in January, 2006. This was not a ""Greatest Hits"" record but rather a collaboration with Al Green's guitarist Teenie Hodges and many other well-known R&B musicians. A tour followed in the fall of 2006.

Early in 2006, Marshall announced the cancellation of her upcoming United States tour, citing ""health-related issues"". A few days later, Matador announced the cancellation of her two shows in London and Paris. She resumed touring in April 2006, playing some of the most well received shows of her career both with the Memphis Rhythm Band and as a solo performer. 

In 2007, she played live music for the spring/ summer Chanel Haute Couture collection in Paris and appeared in Wong Kar Wai's film My Blueberry Nights as Katya. Also in 2007, she became the first female ever to win the Shortlist Music Prize when The Greatest was voted album of the year in June. Earlier in the year she was nominated in the Best International Female category at the annual Brit Awards, alongside more mainstream artists like Christina Aguilera and Nelly Furtado. 

On January 22, 2008, Cat Power released a second collection of covers called Jukebox--her eighth LP overall. It included versions of songs by artists such as Hank Williams, James Brown, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Patsy Cline and Janis Joplin.

Since then, she has released an EP called ""The Dark End of the Street"" on vinyl, only.

Cat Power released her first original song since 2008 just before Christmas 2011 when an MP3 of ""King Rides By"" was made available on her official site, in exchange for a donation of at least $0.99 to the Festival of Children Foundation and the Ali Forney Center charities. (King Rides By Songfacts). 

In 2012, Cat Power released her 9th studio album,  Sun  which received generally positive reviews from critics. The album was included in several year-end lists by music critics and publications. Rolling Stone magazine, in their list of the ""50 Best Albums of 2012"", ranked it at sixteenth place, writing ""the idea of the brilliantly morose Chan Marshall making a dance-rock record is almost absurd. Yet the groove-powered Sun is a perfect fit."" The A.V. Club placed the album at number twenty-two on their list of the ""Best Albums of 2012."" Billboard also placed the album at number nine in their list of the ""10 Best Albums of 2012.""The L.A. Times and Filter magazine both placed the album at number six in their lists of the best albums of 2012. Sun was also included on two separate ""Best Music of 2012"" lists compiled by NPR, appearing at number five on the list compiled by Bob Boilen,while topping the list compiled by Robin Hilton. The album was also listed twenty-eighth on Stereogum's list of top 50 albums of 2012. Thus, becoming Cat Power's most successful original album. 

In April 2015, Marshall announced that she recently had a baby.

In February 2016, Marshall had to cancel her New Zealand shows due to health reasons. According to an official press release, this is the first time in Marshall's 18-year touring history she has been forced to postpone, but is ""determined to make it back ASAP, and in good health"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cat+Power"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

186,186,mother mother,1550673,77190292,"Mother Mother is an indie rock band which formed in Quadra Island, British Columbia, Canada in 2005. The band consists of Ryan Guldemond (vocals, guitar), Molly Guldemond (vocals, keyboards), Jasmin Parkin (keyboards, vocals), Jeremy Page (bass) and Ali Saidat (drums). So far they have released ten albums: Touch Up (2007), O My Heart (2008), Eureka (2011), The Sticks (2012), Very Good Bad Thing (2015),  No Culture (2017), Dance And Cry (2018), Inside (2021), Grief Chapter (2024), and their latest album, DEMMOS (2024), released recently on November 14th, 2024.

The band began in Vancouver in January 2005, when guitarist and vocalist Ryan Guldemond was at music school and wanted to start a band based around vocal-driven pop songs. He recruited his sister Molly along with a friend from college, Debra-Jean Creelman, to accompany his own vocals for the songs he had written, and the trio played as an acoustic act before adding drummer Kenton Loewen and bassist Jeremy Page.

The five members started off playing under the name Mother, and in the fall of 2005, they independently released a self-titled album. This debut album was recorded with Howard Redekopp, who had also worked with The New Pornographers and Tegan and Sara. When the Vancouver Province rated Mother as one of the top five BC bands to watch for in 2007, they began to receive acclaim for their debut album. Shortly thereafter, Mother landed a nationally broadcasted concert opening for K'naan and The Wailin' Jennys. In the summer of 2006, they opened for the Australian band, The Cat Empire, at the sold-out Vancouver International Jazz Festival. Later that year, they made their debut in central Canada at the Montreal International Jazz Festival on June 29 as well as in Toronto on July 1, Canada Day, at the Harbourfront Centre.

In October 2006, after playing a set at the Pop Montreal festival, Mother met with Last Gang Records and later signed a four-album contract. At that point the label encouraged the band to change their name to avoid legal issues, so rather than changing it completely they decided to simply rename themselves Mother Mother. On February 20, 2007, the band re-released its debut album under the new name, renaming the album Touch Up and including two new songs, as well as artwork and overdubs different from the original.

The band released their second album, O My Heart, in 2008. In December 3, it was announced that Debra-Jean Creelman had left Mother Mother, with the addition of a new singer/keyboardist, Jasmin Parkin, announced in January 2009.

Mother Mother's third album, Eureka, was released on March 15, 2011. The album's lead single, ""The Stand,"" entered the Canada Singles Top 100 chart in May 2011 and peaked during that week at position 76. The album prompted a reviewer at the Toronto Star to describe the band as ""evolving into orchestral harmonies and hip hop-influenced power ballads, as if Adam Lambert had joined The Dirty Projectors."" On January 9, 2012, Kraft Foods launched a series of television commercials featuring the song ""Bright Idea.""

Mother Mother's fourth album, The Sticks, was released on September 18, 2012. It contains 14 tracks and was co-produced by band frontman Ryan Guldemond and producer Ben Kaplan. The first single, ""Let's Fall in Love"", was released on July 17, and the second single, ""Bit By Bit"" in December.

In 2014 the band signed with Universal Music Canada to produce their fifth album, Very Good Bad Thing, which was released on November 4, 2014. The first single from the album, ""Get Out The Way"" was released on July 15, 2014.

Mother Mother has since produced two more albums under Universal Music Canada. In February 2017 ""No Culture"" was released, with the first single ""The Drugs"" released November 4, 2016, and the second single ""Love Stuck"" released November 29. 

In November 2018, ""Dance and Cry"" was released, the only single ""Get Up"" released on September 14.

In  June 2021, "" Inside""  was released, this was the first album to feature a remastered song with their popular single from O My Heart ""Hayloft"" getting a remaster in the form of ""Hayloft II""

After a short break from 2022-2023, Mother Mother released two albums. The first of which being  ""Grief Chapter, and the second being ""DEMMOS."" Grief Chapter was announced in November of 2023 and was released the following few months on February 16th, 2024. DEMMOS was the tenth and most recent album released by Mother Mother on November 15th, 2024. It was not announced beforehand and was a silent release, and is the first and only album by Mother Mother to feature demos of currently existing songs. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mother+Mother"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Simm originally auditioned for the ITV reality TV show, Popstars. Ultimately, he made it into the final 10, but was not chosen to get into the winning group, Hear’Say.
The remaining five “losers”, including Simm, then formed the band Liberty X. They subsequently went on to gain more success than Hear’Say, including three albums and a UK number one single and Brit award for their track, “Just A Little”.  Liberty X officially split up in 2007, where Simm later stated, “It gave me a chance to break free from a career that had become more like a day job. I’m now able to concentrate on getting back to the roots of why I had wanted to be an artist in the first place.”
Following Liberty X’s split in 2007, Simm began focusing on his solo career. Since then, he has created his own Myspace music profile, uploading demo tracks for his fans to hear his progress as a solo artist. In a March 2008 interview with Gordon McCully, he stated, “I’ve been very busy in the studio recording new solo tracks which I’ll hopefully be able to share with people very soon.” Simm has signed to JamDown Music, which his track “Brand New” is featured on their official website’s music player.

Soon after she self-released her debut single 'Top to Toe' - a song she had written when she was only 15 - which aling with her next two singles amassed over 20 million streams in the next 18 months.

A prolific artist, she soon found herself collaborating with a number of other musicians, including Aldous Harding and fellow Bristolians Tamu Massif & Oliver Wilde.

Throughout this whole time however, she has been writing for her own songs. Enlisting some musical friends to join her and recording with one foot on the Isle of Wight and one in Bristol, Fenne completed her debut album due in 2018.

191,191,churupaca,18604,195053,"Churupaca began one winter in Buenos Aires, where Fefo Selles (singer, bassist, composer, artistic producer) and Juana Aguirre (singer, guitarist, composer) met and began to share their songs and musical worlds. Juana, who was living in Bolivia at the time, met again with Fefo during the summer of 2012, and in March of that same year they played the first stages, adding Ricardo Boretta (drums) to their performances. Shortly afterwards, Dario Bercovich (clarinet), Joaquin Gutiérrez Calviño (accordion), and finally Pablo Viru Tirachio (guitar, banjo, charango) joined them.

On stage they dress equally, in suit and tie, far from being a formalism, but rather a manifesto. They believe in a more egalitarian society, and work to make their music a Latin American cry of unity... There are no real boundaries separating them from the audience. Sharing, glances, warmth and festivity are key components in the celebration that takes place on every stage they inhabit.

Churupaca creates a unique universe of sounds in which influences from Rioplatense, Latin American, Flamenco, Balkan, reggae and klezmer music, among others, can be easily highlighted. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Churupaca"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

193,193,lagum,285322,16682441,"Lagum is a Brazilian pop and reggae band formed in 2014 in the city of Brumadinho, Minas Gerais. It is composed by Pedro Calais, Otavio Cardoso, Jorge, Francisco Jardim and formerly Tio Wilson.

It all started in 2014, in the city of Belo Horizonte, when Pedro Calais decided to post a video of one of his compositions on Facebook; a friend who was the promoter of events at a concert hall saw him and encouraged him to form a band to perform at the venue. Therefore, Calais decided to call his childhood friends Otavio Cardoso, Glauco Borges, Francisco Jardim and Breno Braga. The group started their career performing at this concert hall in the city, playing their own songs, which are credited to all of the band.

In May 2016, the quintet released their debut studio album titled Seja o Que Eu Querer. In February 2018, an acoustic version of the song ""Deixa"" was released in partnership with singer Ana Gabriela. The song, in this version, became a success, being among the most played in the country, giving visibility to the group to participate in television programs and sign a contract with the Sony record company. In June 2019, they released their second studio album named Things of the Generation.


On September 12, 2020, the band would perform two shows in drive-in format in the city of Nova Lima, Minas Gerais. However, drummer Tio Wilson (Breno Braga) had an indisposition in the interval between the two performances and died from a cardiorespiratory arrest. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lagum"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

194,194,the filthy souls,10253,45890,"The Filthy Souls, young, indie-rockers out of Manchester, England, possess a creative maturity beyond their youthful experience and it’s that maturity that drives their music and performance. Their strength of voice transcends any era classification, while still giving just a wink toward their own musical influences. Their obvious appeal to U.S. audiences comes from, as the Sunday Telegraph Australia calls it, the mix of “a bit of Indie pop and dirty, sexy rock!”

At the young age of 14, singer/songwriter/guitarist Dave Green joined with drummer Marc Hogan, to create and release their first CD, The People. After three years of sharpening their talents, the band-mates went their separate ways, each in search of their own, unique musical styles. While spending a year in Canada, the separation period proved to be the stimulus Green’s writing needed. Inspired by the new possibilities, he invited Hogan to join him and reunite. Bass player, Baz Robinson was added shortly thereafter to complete the line-up, and in October 2007, The Filthy Souls were re-born. 

Back in the UK, the band became regulars on the music scene, playing everywhere from the small pubs in Wigan, to the auspicious Manchester Academy 3. Crisscrossing the British Isles, they hit the festival circuit, opening for such artists as Tim Burgess of the Charlatans, Finger Eleven and Cage The Elephant. During this time, Green notes, “We were all about the music, not just playing, but making it a part of our very being, and giving that to the fans.”

As with any ambitious group of Brits, success on the isle isn’t enough. So, next up for the band . . . Invasion USA. In July, 2008, The Filthy Souls flew to the States to tour Los Angeles, San Diego and Las Vegas, playing such notable venues as The Viper Room, Key Club, The Roxy, and Club Moscow. Following their tour’s success, they self-released their debut single “Boys Will Be Out for a Fight” in November 2008, followed by the EP, Save Me in February 2009.

The music of this Brit rock/pop group has already been featured on American TV. The Filthy Souls have been heard on the 2009 season of One Tree Hill, Vanished and ABC’s Greek. The band was actually written into the script for ABC’s hit comedy 
10 Things I Hate About You. The Filthy Souls have recently made live appearances on Manchester’s Channel M, as well as having been heard in radio interviews with L.A.’s Camp Freddy on Indie 103.1, NPR’s KCRW Los Angeles, Tom Robinson on BBC 6 Introducing and on Manchester’s Key 103.

The buzz is electric, the excitement is building, and the momentum is launching this indie-rock band straight into the heart of the music industry. Now is the time to stand up, let go, and experience The Filthy Souls.

www.ManchesterMusic.co.uk - 

""THE FILTHY SOULS are one of those bands that does exactly what it says on the tin: full-blooded garage rock with a fuck load of spirit. A bit golden age Strokes with bigger balls, a bit Black Rebel, a bit bluesy, alt-country even; music that actually sounds sweaty and sexy. No surprises then that they come from the capital of such things... Detroit? New York? Nope. Wigan. Much like their geographical and spiritual neighbours Moco (one of whom's down watching) this is rock'n'roll that's not short on soul.""

""The Filthy Souls are an unsigned rock band from Wigan. Formed late in 2007 the band are quickly bubbling to the top of the unsigned music scene and are set to tour LA (USA) in the Summer of 2008.

199,199,caroline rose,330262,5276885,"Caroline Elizabeth Rose (born October 19, 1989) is an American singer, songwriter, musician and producer. After releasing two records of folk and country-inspired music, she released a pop-rock album Loner in 2018. Superstar was released on March 6, 2020. Her most recent album, The Art of Forgetting, was released on March 24, 2023. 

Born in 1989 in Long Island, Rose grew up in Center Moriches, New York. The daughter of two artists, Rose began writing songs and poems at age 13. Rose attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she graduated in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in architecture.

In 2012, Rose and producer/multi-instrumentalist Jer Coons launched a Kickstarter to fund the production of Rose's first album America Religious. The album, blending American folk music, country, and rockabilly styles was self-published later that year. Two years later, Rose released her first nationally distributed album, I Will Not Be Afraid on Little Hi! Records. Like the first album, it was produced with Jer Coons and featured music in a variety of Americana musical styles, including two songs previously released on America Religious.

Following the release of I Will Not Be Afraid, Rose took an extended hiatus from touring and releasing new material, while she explored new musical directions that would broaden her sound. After three years, numerous personnel changes, a signing to mother + Pop Music, and a switch to New West Records, Rose released her third album. The new album, Loner, was co-produced by Rose and Paul Butler of The Bees, and represented a radical shift away from the musical style of her previous work, blending pop and alternative rock elements, and incorporating prominent synthesizers throughout. Notably, this album also saw a change in lyrical tone, incorporating a number of overtly humorous, sarcastic, and satirical songs. Although Rose played most of the instruments on the album, she formed a new band to perform on tour. 

Prior to Loner's release, Rose released ""Money"" and ""Soul No. 5"" with accompanying music videos. Rose released a music video for ""Jeannie Becomes a Mom"" on October 17, 2018. The video, which was directed by Amanda Speva, features Abby Pierce as the titular character, depicting Jeannie moving into a new home, performing a dance routine with the movers, and preparing a rainbow Jell-O cake. The song was ranked the fifteenth-best single of the year by National Public Radio.

On January 7, 2020, Rose announced a new album called Superstar, releasing a single and a music video for the song ""Feel The Way I Want"". The video was shot on an iPhone over the course of an 11-day roadtrip from Hollywood, California to Hollywood, Florida, documenting the protagonist's journey after she travels to the wrong Hollywood for an audition. According to Rose, the album is a ""cinematic pop album that tells a story of someone who leaves behind everything she knows and loves in search for something bigger and more glamorous. It's a story about losing yourself but also finding the brazen self-confidence to follow a dream."" The album Superstar was released on March 6, 2020, and Caroline Rose made her television debut on February 24, 2020, performing ""Feel The Way I Want"" on Late Night with Seth Meyers. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Caroline+Rose"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Carlile's music has been categorized in several genres, including pop, rock, alternative country, and folk. She released her first album, 'Brandi Carlile', on July 12, 2005.

In the beginning, Columbia Records signed Carlile in late 2004 on the strength of songs she'd been recording periodically at home. Released in 2005, Brandi Carlile showcased those early songs along with several newly recorded tracks. Shortly after the release of Brandi Carlile, she left her home in Seattle and set out with the Hanseroth brothers, with whom she'd worked on her earliest recordings and independent regional tours. The tightly knit trio, which forms the core of her band today, spent the better part of two years on the road honing the songs that would later become part of her album ""The Story"".

In 2005, she was featured on Rolling Stone's ""10 Artists to Watch in 2005"" list. By the end of 2006, Carlile had embarked on several headlining tours and supported a variety of artists including Ray LaMontagne, The Fray, Chris Isaak, Tori Amos, and Shawn Colvin.

Her second album, The Story, was released in April 2007. It was produced by T Bone Burnett and includes a collaboration with the Indigo Girls on ""Cannonball."" The album was recorded in an eleven-day-long session with Carlile , the twins (Tim and Phil Hanseroth) and drummer Matt Chamberlain to capture the raw intensity of Carlile's live performances. The crack in Carlile's vocals during the title track, ""The Story"", came out by accident and was a direct result of the way the album was recorded. Carlile herself describes the vocals as ""technically wrong but emotionally right.""

Carlile was exposed to a wider audience when ABC's Grey's Anatomy showcased three of her songs: ""Tragedy,"" ""What Can I Say,"" and ""Throw It All Away"". In April 2007, Grey's Anatomy debuted a version of the video for the single The Story interspersed with footage from the show. On May 3, 2007, a special two-hour episode of ""Grey's Anatomy"" featured Carlile's song ""Turpentine"" during footage of the ""Grey's Anatomy"" spin-off, ""Private Practice"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 2011 he founded the Troupe D'Elite, a group which also included the rapper Er Nyah (now known as Ernia), the singer Maite and the producer Fonzie.

After performing in Istanbul with Jacco Gardner, bassist Jasper Verhulst became fascinated by the Turkish sound of the 70s. At that time, artists like Selda, Barış Manço and Erkin Koray combined traditional music with western rock influences.

Along with bandmates Ben Rider (guitar) and Nic Mauskovic (drums), Verhulst searched for Turkish musicians to revive this sound. They found Merve Dasdemir (vocals) and Erdinc Yildiz Ecevit (vocals, saz, keys) through Facebook. Jungle by Night’s energetic percussionist Gino Groeneveld joined the group and the band was complete. 

Altın Gün play songs from the aforementioned artists from the 70’s and their lesser-known contemporaries and also make their own arrangements of Turkish traditionals.

Aurora was born in Massachusetts and grew up in both Queens, New York, U.S.A. and Stamford, Connecticut, U.S.A. Her parents immigrated to Queens from India in 1984. She became exposed to R&B, Soul, Jazz and Folk music in middle school, which piqued her interest in music and influenced her musical style later in life.

2) Raveena born on 18 May 1997 in Antwerp, Belgium is a British musician with parents of Indian origin, Dimple and Rajiv Mehta. Raveena is an elder sister to sister Kareena and brother Rajveer. Her last.fm user name is RaveenaMusic.

As a child, Raveena showed fascinating interest in music and arts. She developed artistic skills at an early age and grew fond of music and instruments. At the age of 5 years, her exposure to music was formalized through her school and by Piano lessons. Her initial performances were made at school and community talent shows.

Later, she started formal dance and singing lessons through coach Suchita Parte, whose recording ""Designer Bliss” is one of the best selling Indian albums of all time. Through encouragement from her family and uncle Vishal, she started recording her first album “From Deep Within” at Earth Studios in Mumbai (India). Tushar Parte, husband and composer of Suchita’s successful release, was in charge of the compositions.

The result was a wonderful collection of songs full of love, hope and happiness, masterfully combining the deepest, most beautiful melodies, all of which will soon be in your hands. MR. DJ, the song presented here as Raveena’s debut single, recorded when she was 11, not only contains one of the most rocking tunes you’ve ever heard; it’s also an extremely powerful and emotional song that you’ll never get tired to listen to.

He is best known for independently creating the video game Stardew Valley. He programmed the game, created all art assets as well as all sound effects and music.

Barone was born in Los Angeles and spent his childhood in Auburn, Washington. Barone had practiced basic programming but did not consider making video games as a career. Unable to find employment after graduating college, he initially began developing Stardew Valley in 2012 in order to practice programming in C#, and planned to put the game on his resume for potential employers. Barone worked on the game daily as its sole creator until its release in 2016. 

He was praised for creating the game independently, as its sole designer, programmer, animator, artist, composer, and writer. To complete the game, Barone worked 10 hours a day, seven days a week, for four and a half years. For part of that time, he lived with his parents to save money before moving out with his girlfriend to Capitol Hill, Seattle. 

Barone initially released Stardew on the PC before later developing it for other consoles. By February 2024, he had sold over 30 million copies.

In 2017, he was named by Forbes magazine in their list ""30 Under 30: Games"" for his work on Stardew Valley. Since 2019, Barone has been assisted on Stardew Valley by another designer.

On October 10, 2023, Barone announced the first Stardew Valley concert tour, Stardew Valley: Festival of Seasons, featuring a selection of music from the game performed live by a chamber orchestra. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/ConcernedApe"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

225,225,l'impératrice,535382,12319996,"L'Impératrice (French pronunciation: [lɛ̃peʁatʁis]; ""The Empress"") is a project that began in 2012, a French band with a myriad of dreams that have now become reality. However, the vision of each of them has not changed that much as they have become an international band and they claim to keep their feet very firmly on the ground, as, in their words, it is always a work in progress. Despite this, there are still achievements to unlock, one of which is playing at Madison Square Garden, one of their favourite venues.

The band was initially formed by keyboardist Charles de Boisseguin, who started the project solo until he met the other keyboardist, Hagni Gwon. Gwon later called in bassist David Gaugué and drummer Tom Daveau. Soon after, guitarist Achille Trocellier joined, and the group was officially formed in 2012. In 2015, french singer Flore Benguigui joined the group. After making 3 studio albums and spending 9 years with the band, Flore announced her departure from L'Impératrice in September 2024, citing ""profound personal, artistic, and fundamental disagreements"" between her and the band. Less than a month later, the band revealed their new vocalist Louve.

Their pop, funk and electronic sounds, Flore's sweet tone singing in French, coupled with a retro yet futuristic aesthetic, broke the language barrier and took them to stages they could never have imagined. After albums and EPs such as ""Sonate Pacifique"", ""Odyssée"", ""Vanille Fraise"" and ""Matahari"", their most recent album is 2024's ""Pulsar"", with songs in English and French, which included collaborations with artists such as Erick the Architect and Maggie Rogers.

L'Impératrice's retro pop and disco music places them as heirs to the French Touch trend pioneered by Daft Punk, to whom they have paid homage in their music videos, and represented by groups such as Air and Phoenix. But in their case, they pride themselves on being a band that doesn't rely so much on synthesizers, but plays their instruments entirely live.

They once received an email from a fan who congratulated them on their EP L'Odyssée but couldn't understand why on vinyl Flore Benguigui's voice sounded so different from the YouTube videos, almost sounding like a boy. The answer to the mystery: he had been playing the record at the wrong speed. This happy accident led the band to release a slowed-down version of the work. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/L%27Imp%C3%A9ratrice"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Guitarist Henry Stoehr, bass player Alexander Leeds, and drummer Theodore Mathews started making music together as friends in the sixth grade, naming their first band from letters in their first names. It wasn't until high school, when Emily Massey contributed guitar and backing vocals to later incarnation Slow Pulp's second EP, 2017's EP2, that an improved vision of the band clicked. They soon made Massey lead singer and took down a debut EP that didn't involve her.

Now a four-piece, the group worked up the stand-alone tracks ""At Home"" and ""Steel Birds,"" which they self-released in 2018 while relocating to Chicago. Written and mostly recorded in a cabin in Michigan in January 2019, the Big Day EP followed in May 2019. Slow Pulp headed out on tour with Alex G later in the year, as they worked on their full-length debut. The project was not without obstacles; material was scrapped, and Massey struggled with her own health problems before returning to Madison to help her parents recover from a car accident. The COVID-19 pandemic soon limited travel. With Stoehr acting as main engineer, producer, and mixer, they were able to complete the album long-distance.

230,230,s. carey,464115,5412663,"S. Carey is American musician Sean Carey of Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Carey is best known as the drummer and supporting vocalist of indie folk band Bon Iver. In August 2010, Carey released his first solo album, All We Grow.

The debut album is the result of a young lifetime spent immersed in music.  As a band member of Bon Iver from the very beginning, Carey endured a flip of his formal training to step firmly into a worldwide-touring rock band.  His performance degree in classical percussion from the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire and his love for jazz drumming prepared him for a central role in the inspiring force of the Bon Iver live show.

All We Grow is a convergence of Carey's Waltz For Debbie era Bill Evans inflected jazz tendencies, and traditional rock band experience, taking leads from Mark Hollis' Talk Talk. It also retests the waters of modern classical composition, investigating the moodiness generated by percussive repetition in a manner familiar to fans of Steve Reich. In his downtime on tour with Bon Iver, Sean would spend time pining for his soul-mate's arms, and in that context, dreaming and composing.  During infrequent tour breaks at home he would patiently record these pieces, adding layers each time. Two years later, the parts converged to make an album.

For as much room to breathe as Carey allows his compositions, there are incredibly dynamic moments of bombast held right next to moments of subtle depth and texture. Engineered by Jaime Hansen and Brian Joseph, intermittently at home and at April Base (Justin Vernon's studio outside Eau Claire), All We Grow is an all-encompassing headphone experience as intimate as chamber music and as ambitious as a symphony.

While many are familiar with the cabin mythology of Bon Iver, the story behind Sean joining the band is equally kismet.  After hearing through mutual friends that Justin was looking to put together a band, he spent two weeks in his bedroom listening to For Emma, Forever Ago on Myspace, dissecting and learning the drum and vocal parts so well that Justin invited him to join the band upon Sean's approach.

All We Grow is a classic album born without expectation and met with adoration - a cathartic result of Carey's extraordinary and vibrant life experiences that resonates loss, dreams and heart in a manner so instantly relatable, you feel as though you can touch it. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/S.+Carey"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2) On their previous tour, Disclosure arrived in Newport News, VA, 4 1/2 hours from home to learn that their show had been cancelled. Here, most bands would have called it a day, but instead they frantically called friends to search for shows via MySpace. They ended up playing for free and headlining a show in Richmond, VA. This is just one of many stories that showcase Disclosure’s dedication.

In the past 3 years they have released 3 albums, have been part of an East Coast distributed compilation, performed in 7 states, went on 2 self-booked tours, and played over 50 shows. They have an upcoming full East Coast tour scheduled for July/August 2010 and they have no plans of slowing down.

Collaborations with vocalists such as Gallant, Ray BLK, and Bishop Nehru followed, and Lewis released Dusk, the first EP in a three-part series dedicated to club culture, in 2018.

A native of Reading, England, Lewis first became interested in music in his teens and played in several bands before he started experimenting with remixing tracks. Influenced by the introspective pop of Bon Iver and James Blake, as well as the club-ready hip-hop of artists like Common, Timbaland, and the Neptunes, Lewis began posting his own evocative, moody tracks online. He quickly built a loyal following, and eventually nabbed a residency DJ'ing at London's Chibuku Club.

In 2014, his remix of Jessie Ware's song ""You & I (Forever)"" caught the attention of Ware's label, PMR Records, who then signed him. A year later, he released his debut EP, Shivers. In 2016, Lewis delivered his sophomore EP, Yours, which included the track ""Holding Back,"" featuring Gallant. Lewis' 2017 output consisted of the Toulouse-aided single ""Times We Had"" and the solo track ""Smart Aleck Kill."" He returned in January 2018 with ""Aura,"" a bright yet low-key track featuring vocalist J Warner. The song appeared on the disco-influenced Dusk, which kicked off a trilogy of club-centric EPs slated to appear under the combined full-length album title of Dusk, Dark, Dawn.

Yatra is noted for his romantic lyrics, melding traditional lyricism with modern reggaeton influences. He rose to prominence in Latin America in 2016 when he released the hit ""Traicionera"". He has released three studio albums and recorded with artists from a diverse range of musical genres throughout his career.

Born in Medellín and raised primarily in Miami, Yatra began singing at a young age and returned to Colombia to begin his musical career. He achieved breakout success with ""Traicionera"" followed by ""Robarte un Beso"" featuring Carlos Vives.

He then released the album Fantasia including the lead single ""Un Año"" featuring Mexican band Reik. He received continued success collaborating with Daddy Yankee, Natti Natasha, and the Jonas Brothers on the bilingual single ""Runaway"".

Yatra's music has been classified as Latin pop, reggaeton, and ballads.

In an interview with Billboard, he expressed a desire to collaborate with Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli.

Despite growing up in Florida and being fluent in English, Yatra sings almost exclusively in Spanish. Yatra explains, “My goal was always to be a singer in Spanish. And I really wanted to understand where I come from and live it. A lot of times I went to Colombia and, even though I spoke Spanish and was always speaking Spanish with my parents, I still felt like an outsider. I wasn’t 100 percent part of it. I wanted to give my roots the importance they deserve. ”His June 2019 song ""Runaway"" was his first foray into bilingual songwriting. In December 2019, he collaborated with South Korean boy group Monsta X for the song ""Magnetic"", which features verses from Yatra in Spanish and a bridge from Monsta X in Spanglish.

His parents met after Dennis performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he first interacted with Sandra, who was in attendance. He is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day school, and formally celebrated becoming a Bar Mitzvah in a religious service.

Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Dennis' limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the United States until Drake's early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, however, Dennis would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer. His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song titled ""Drake's Dad"". Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell records, which Drake vehemently denies.

Drake was raised in two Toronto neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end until grade six, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighborhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move, Drake replied, ""[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement; my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.""

He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school. He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighborhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighborhood, Drake described the school as ""not by any means the easiest school to go to."" Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background, and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school. He later graduated in October 2012.

Career - 2001–2005: Degrassi: The Next Generation
At 15, eager to begin as an actor, a high school friend introduced Drake to his father, who was an acting agent. The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks a basketball star who became physically disabled after a classmate shot him. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, ""My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV"". He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, returning for sporadic appearances until his character graduated from school. Overall, Drake appeared in a total of 145 episodes.

2006–2009: Early mixtapes and So Far Gone
Lil Wayne, the founder of Young Money Entertainment, would sign Drake to the label in 2009.
After becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as ""pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it."" The mixtape was released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies. In 2007, he released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single ""Replacement Girl"", featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever-unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with ""Replacement Girl"" being featured on the channel's ""New Joint of the Day"" segment on April 30, 2007. The song also saw Drake sample ""Man of the Year"" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including ""Ransom"", ""Forever"", and a remix to ""Brand New"". Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.

In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles ""Best I Ever Had"" and ""Successful"", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs ""I'm Goin' In"" and ""Fear"". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.

Due to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as ""one of the biggest bidding wars ever"". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album titled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means.

Drake then joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of ""Best I Ever Had"" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He underwent surgery later that year.

2010–2012: Thank Me Later and Take Care
Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.

On March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single ""Over"", which peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, ""Find Your Love"", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[76] The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, ""]Care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image]."" The third single and fourth singles, ""Miss Me"" and ""Fancy"" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.

Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.

It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire on May 8, and he had also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.

Beginning his second effort in fall 2010, Drake announced his intentions to allow for Noah ""40"" Shebib to handle most of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me Later, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and others. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be Take Care. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, ""I didn't get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed many of the songs and sonically I didn't get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round."" Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.

In January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie, to focus on the album. ""Dreams Money Can Buy"" and ""Marvins Room"" were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track listing, while ""Marvins Room"" gained Gold certification by the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio. Drake would soon release the song's music video on June 28.

""Headlines"" was released on August 9, acting as the lead single for Take Care. It was met with positive critical and commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12. It was eventually certified Platinum in both the United States and Canada. The music video for the single was released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game in January 2012. ""Make Me Proud"" was released as the album's second single, on October 16. It was the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number nine the following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88. ""Make Me Proud"" soon became Drake's fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.

Prior to the album's release, Drake had planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne, however, it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne. He had also begun collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled Y.O.L.O., but the duo decided against the project, in favor of increased concern for their respective studio albums.

Take Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. John McDonnell of NME dubbed it ""an affecting masterpiece"" and commended its ""delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive lyrics."" Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal found Drake's ""technical abilities"" to be improved and stated, ""Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up."" Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice called it ""a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West."" Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented the depth of Drake's ""moral psychodramas"" and stated, ""the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying power."" It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial success, eventually being certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the US.

The album's third and fourth singles, ""The Motto"" and Take Care"", were released on November 29, and February 21, 2012 respectively. Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with ""The Motto"" credited for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States. The music video for ""Take Care"" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, ""None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] - make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it."" The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year. The song was also featured on the channel's ""Pop Songs You Must Hear"" list of 2011. ""HYFR"" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified Gold. It would later win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video in 2012, and the channel also ranked him at number two on their ""Hottest MCs in the Game"" list.

In promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip-hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million. He then returned to acting, starring in Ice Age: Continental Drift as Ethan.

2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and commercial mixtapes
During the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer's influence over his next album. Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics prevalent previously.

In January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off of his third album at the conclusion of the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of his third album. The album's second single, ""Hold On, We're Going Home"", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful single off of the album, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song's music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the video. Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing the album's third single, ""Too Much"", alongside featured artist Sampha.

Nothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favorable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in 808s & Heartbreak. The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further promoted by the ""Would You like a Tour?"" throughout late 2013, to early 2014. It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million. Drake then returned to acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night Live, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what ""kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters"". Drake also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city. In late 2014, Drake announced that he had begun recording sessions for his fourth studio album.

In 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the Romeo Santos song Odio. He also appeared on a remix of Tuesday by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard's Rhythmic chart and number twelve on the ""Hot 100"", and released ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"" as a non-album single. The latter went double platinum in the United States.

On February 12, 2015, Drake released If You're Reading This It's Too Late onto iTunes, with no prior announcement. Despite debate on whether it is an album or a mixtape, its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money Records, a scheme that was rumored to allow Drake to leave the label. However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and If You're Reading This It's Too Late sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall. Drake proceeded If You're Reading This It's Too Late with a collaborative mixtape with Future, which was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week.

What a Time to Be Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Drake the first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the same year since 2004. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units. Drake also appeared on the cover of The Fader for their 100th issue.

2016–2017: Views and More Life
Drake announced in January 2016 that his fourth studio album would be launched during the spring, releasing the promotional single ""Summer Sixteen"" later that month. The album was originally titled Views from the six, but would later be shortened to Views. ""Summer Sixteen"" debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip-hop to more tenured artists. This move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as ""goodly brash"" or ""conventionally disrespectful."" It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake popularizing the term ""The Six"" when referencing Toronto. Drake also crashed a Bat Mitzvah in New York City on February 20, performing at the event.

Drake soon released the album's lead singles, ""Pop Style"" and the dancehall-infused ""One Dance"", on April 5. Both debuted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with ""One Dance"" becoming Drake's first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist. The single also became Drake's first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed the album's release date of April 29, and followed it up with various promotional videos. On October 15, ""One Dance"" became Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016.

Views was previewed in London, before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being made available to various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later to release a short film titled Please Forgive Me, starring frequent collaborators, Swedish twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta. As of 2019, Views remains Drake's best-selling album.

Drake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as the show's musical guest. Later, Drake was named as a member of the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury. During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the music video for ""Child's Play"" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics. On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views. At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Drake received the most nominations, with 10, winning the awards for Album of the Year and Best Hip-Hop Video. Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the course of the tour in Europe. Seven additional dates were added a day later due to overwhelming demands.

Soon after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed he would be releasing a project titled More Life in December, however he later pushed the date back to the new year. The project was described as a ""playlist of original music"", rather than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album. He was later revealed to be Spotify's most streamed artist for the second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion streams for all projects on the service, which is more than double the amount of streams he had in 2015. Drake later secured his second and third Grammy Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony. Despite multiple setbacks, Drake announced More Life would be released on March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials released through Instagram. Upon release, More Life received mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200, earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It also set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever streamed album in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music alone. The album also garnered 61.3 million streams on Spotify, dethroning Ed Sheeran's ÷ as the highest opening on the service in a single day. He later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins in a single show. Billboard also reported Drake had been present on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has the most recorded entries by a solo artist.

He then released the single ""Signs"" on June 24, as well as reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset. The singles marked his first releases since More Life, with ""Signs"" was initially released as a collaboration between Drake and French fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the ""Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2018"" fashion show. The event also had a playlist exclusively from OVO Sound, curated by label co-founder Oliver El-Khatib. Drake later hosted the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of Virginia Black. Drake then appeared in The Carter Effect documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince Carter, who was the first superstar player to appear for the Toronto Raptors since the franchise's inception in 1995. The documentary also featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and LeBron James.

2018: Scorpion and return to television
After rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer Pi'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017. Two songs would later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on January 20, 2018, marking Drake's first solo release since More Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring on a remix of the Jay-Z song ""Family Feud"" with Lil Wayne, as the lead single of the latter's Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape. Scary Hours featured the songs ""Diplomatic Immunity"" and ""God's Plan"", which both debuted within the top-ten, with the latter eventually breaking various streaming records as it debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was Drake's second as a solo artist to reach number one.

Drake earned his 70th top 40 hit after featuring on the Migos song ""Walk It Talk It"", which debuted at number eighteen, and peaked at number ten. He later featured on BlocBoy JB's debut single, ""Look Alive"", which was released on February 9, 2018. The song's entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper with the top 10 hits on the Hot 100, with 23. He then featured on a remix to ""Lemon"", a song originally released as collaboration between band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, Drake announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was releasing a single later that night. On April 6, ""Nice for What"" was released, alongside a music video, which featured several female celebrities.

After ""Nice For What"" replaced his own ""God's Plan"" on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace their former number-one debut, Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion, with a planned release date of June 29, 2018. He then released ""I'm Upset"" on May 26, as the album's third single. Scorpion was then released as a double-album, and marked Drake's longest project, with a run-time of just under 90 minutes. The album broke both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it gained 132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming service, respectively. It eventually sold 749,000 album equivalent units in its first week of sales, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.

Shortly thereafter, Drake collaborated with British hip hop promotion Link Up TV on July 7, releasing a freestyle as a part of the promotion's 'Behind Barz' segment, before releasing another freestyle a week later after featuring on Charlie Sloth's long-running Fire in the Booth program on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Drake then earned his sixth number-one hit with ""In My Feelings"" on July 21, which also spawned the viral ""#InMyFeelingsChallenge"" or ""#KiKiChallenge"". The success of ""In My Feelings"" also made Drake the record holder for most number one hits among rappers. Soon after, he released the music video for ""Nonstop"", which was filmed in London during his surprise performance at the Wireless Festival.

He then appeared on the album Astroworld, featuring uncredited vocals for the song ""Sicko Mode"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Drake announced in July 2018 that he planned to ""take 6 months to a year"" to himself in order to produce television and films, including Euphoria. He then began the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour with co-headliners Migos on August 12. This preceded collaboration with Bad Bunny titled ""Mia"", which featured Drake performing in Spanish. He later received the award for Hot Ticket Performer at the 2018 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 16. During a performance in Edmonton on November 7, Drake announced his intention to begin composing his next project in early 2019.

2019–present: Upcoming album
In February 2019, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rap Song, for ""God's Plan"", at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. During his speech, producers abruptly cut to a commercial break, leading viewers to speculate they were censoring his speech during which he criticized The Recording Academy. A legal representative for the Academy then released a statement stating ""a natural pause [led] the producers [to] assume that he was done and cut to commercial,"" and added the organization offered him an opportunity to return to stage, but he declined.

On February 14, Drake re-released his third mixtape, So Far Gone, onto streaming services for the first time to commemorate its 10-year anniversary, and later collaborated with Summer Walker on a remix of Walker's song ""Girls Need Love"", marking his first release of 2019. On April 10, 2019 during a London performance on his Assassination Vacation Tour, the OVO leader told the crowd he was working on his new album before the show. On June 8, Drake appeared on Chris Brown's single ""No Guidance"". On June 15, Drake released two songs, ""Omertà"" and ""Money in the Grave"", on his EP The Best in the World Pack to celebrate the NBA Championship win of the Toronto Raptors. On August 2, he released the compilation album Care Package, consisting of songs released between 2010 and 2016 that were initially unavailable for purchase or commercial streaming; it debuted at number one.

Artistry - influences
Drake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West, Jay Z, and Lil Wayne, while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah, and Usher. Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his ""biggest inspirations"".

Musical style
Drake has credited Kanye West (left) and Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical influences. Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism. His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as ""ting"", ""touching road"", ""talkin' boasy"" and ""gwanin' wassy"". Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip-hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing. He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.

The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional or boastful. However, Drake is often revered for incorporating ""degrading"" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between ""pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata."" Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as ""hyper-reality rap"", which is characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as being distinct from the ""real world.""

Public image
The Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States, with his single, ""The Motto"", which includes, ""You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO."" Drake later popularized the term ""The Six"" in 2015 in relation his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city. Furthermore, the subject matter of his artistry often revolving around relationships, have had widespread impact on social media through photo captions commonly used to reference emotions or personal situations. However, his lyrical contents have had a negative reception from fans and critics deeming him as sensitive; a trait that is understood as being antithetical to hip hop culture. June 10 was declared ""Drake Day"" in Houston, Texas. In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines, in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance. In 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States. He would also donate $200,000 in order to aid relief efforts in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey. In February 2018, following the single ""God's Plan"" debut at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Drake donated $50,000 to a Miami homeless shelter and giving a University of Miami student $50,000 to help with her tuition. Drake then ""kept up the spending spree"" by donating the rest of the song's video budget, $996,631.90, to several charitable causes and regular people across Miami.

The music video for ""Hotline Bling"" went viral, due to Drake's eccentric choices in dancing. The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake's unconventional nature on the song, causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, spawning several parodies. Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exampled by the video for ""Hotline Bling"". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6"" Classic Boots. This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose, in which various items of clothing were produced. Drake had also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the ""Air Jordan OVOs"". Moreover, his style and dress sense have caused GQ magazine to describe him as ""[one of] the most stylish men alive"".

Controversies - legal issues
In 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on ""Marvins Room"". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties. Despite Drake's legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling ""Jimmy Smith Rap"", a 1982 single by jazz musician, Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who stated Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on ""Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2"", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop. Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement. Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics on when collaborating with YG on the song ""Who Do You Love?"". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year. In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.

In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel ""Chubbs"" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also says the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering. The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu, after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference; the judge ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense.

Feuds
Drake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident and released a song criticizing Drake weeks later. Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute.

In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe magazine. Drake would later respond on ""6 God"" and ""6PM in New York"", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment.

Further controversy arose in July 2015, when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during recording sessions for ""RICO"", one of the lead singles off of Mill's second studio album. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller. Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for ""R.I.C.O."". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for ""R.I.C.O."", ""10 Bands"", and ""Know Yourself"". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, titled ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back"", in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with ""Wanna Know"", before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later. Despite subliminal disses from either artist, the feud has not been officially reignited. Drake would further seek to denounce Funkmaster Flex during his Madison Square Garden shows on the Summer Sixteen Tour. Following Meek Mill's sentencing of two to four years for probation violation, Drake stated ""Free Meek Mill"" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on ""Family Feud"". Pusha T would also use the same rationale to criticize Drake on ""Infrared"" in 2018, prompting Drake to respond with the ""Duppy Freestyle"" diss track on May 25. Pusha T would directly respond to the track through ""The Story of Adidon"" on May 29, which presented several claims, including an accusation of Drake fathering a secret child. The pair is considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, with Drake yet to respond to ""The Story of Adidon"".

In 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through ""4PM in Calabasas"", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on ""No Shopping"" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song. However, French Montana claimed that Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake, he has yet to officially respond to Budden. In the same year, Drake mocked Kid Cudi for his mental health, drug use and suicidal urges on ""Two Birds, One Stone"" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter. Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.

In mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator, Kanye West. In an appearance on the talk show The Shop in October, Drake recounted several business meetings with West, who voiced his desire to ""be Quincy Jones"" and work with him, in order to replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson. West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, which was agreed to as Drake ""felt a genuine vibe"" from West, and after West gifted him the beat to ""Lift Yourself"", which inspired Drake to begin writing to the instrumental. West then requested Drake to travel to Wyoming to continue working, and arrived a day after close friend 40. 40 said West was working on an album; contradictory to his previous aim of just wanting to ""give [Drake] beats"". Drake responded by saying West stated he would release in late 2018, and they should continue on. However, upon his arrival in Wyoming, Drake ""[spent] the majority of time working on [West's] music"", only exploring his own after playing the producer the song ""March 14"", which addresses Drake's relationship with his newborn son and co-parent. This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T. West would also release ""Lift Yourself"", and produce ""Infrared""; actions that greatly displeased Drake. This prompted him to denounce West in several songs and live performances. West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018.

Drake has purported to have been in reported feuds with DMX, Kendrick Lamar, Common, The Weeknd, XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez, and Ludacris, although the latter three have been reported to be resolved.

Business ventures - Endorsements
Prior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient. In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger King and Whataburger. Business magazine Forbes commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships ""combined heavily"" for Drake's reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the highest-paid celebrities during that period.

Main article: OVO Sound
During the composition of Nothing Was the Same, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, and business partner, Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the trio to team up to form OVO Sound. The name is an abbreviation derived from the October's Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects. Warner Bros. Records currently distribute the label.

Drake, 40 and PartyNextDoor were the label's inaugural artists. The label houses artists including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, OB O'Brien, Roy Woods, dvsn, Plaza, and Kash Doll, as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Mike Zombie, Nineteen85, and Future the Prince. OVO Sound has released six albums, with two certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Toronto Raptors
On September 30, 2013, at a press conference with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke, Drake was announced as the new ""global ambassador"" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. This would also be the setting where Drake was given The Key to the City. In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities, beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary. He began by hosting an annual ""Drake Night"" segment with the organization, which began in 2013.

Apple Music
Following the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million. This saw all future solo releases by Drake becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers. Drake had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted More Life. Drake's partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform's sharp success, as it attained 10 million subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists, such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services. Through signing with the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before the smartwatch saw public release.

Virginia Black
Two months prior to the release of Views, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based whiskey. This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring's Restaurant in Toronto. The beverage was created and also distributed alongside Proximo Spirits, as well as with Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008. The company described the partnership as ""fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey.""

The product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically. The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music and various tours, such as being part of the ""Virginia Black VIP Lounge"" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016. The company later aired commercials with Dennis Graham, which featured the tagline of ""The Realest Dude Ever"" (in reference toward ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to various European countries in 2017.

Personal life
Drake lives in Hidden Hills, California, since 2012. He also owns a property in Toronto, which was built from the ground-up in 2017, and a Toronto condo adjacent to the CN Tower. He owns a Boeing 767 airplane.

Drake's paternal uncles are bass guitarist Larry Graham and musician Teenie Hodges. Graham achieved both critical and commercial success as a member of the band Sly and the Family Stone, while Hodges featured as the lead guitarist and songwriter for Al Green, and contributed heavily on much of his work in the 1970s, including the hits ""Take Me to the River"", ""Love and Happiness"", and ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"".

Drake is a father to one son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French artist Sophie Brussaux. Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumors after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017; Drake eventually confirmed his fatherhood on the album Scorpion in 2018.

Drake dated singer Rihanna off-and-on from 2009 to 2016. He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums, and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said ""she's a woman I've been in love with since I was 22 years old."" On becoming a single parent, he mused on the talk show The Shop:

As life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don't have the fairy tale, like, 'Oh, Drake started a family with Rihanna and this is like so perfect.' It looks so good on paper. By the way, I wanted that too at one time.

Other artists
There are several other artists that have performed under the name Drake:
1) heavy metal act
2) Jason Drake
3) 60s garage rock
4) Polish sea folk band
5) character from the film “The Pebble and the Penguin” <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Drake"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

12,12,imagine dragons,3536673,209252811,"Imagine Dragons is a pop rock band which formed in 2008 in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. The band consists of Dan Reynolds (vocals), Wayne Sermon (guitar), Ben McKee (bass) and Daniel Platzman (drums). The band released four EPs - ""Imagine Dragons"" (2009), ""Hell and Silence"" (2010), ""It's Time"" (2011) and ""Continued Silence"" (2012) - before releasing their debut full length album ""Night Visions"" on 4 September 2012.

The band's single ""It's Time"", which previously appeared on the ""It's Time"" and ""Continued Silence"" EPs in addition to appearing on ""Night Visions"", is the group's biggest hit, reaching #33 on the Billboard Hot 100.

In a dark kitchen in the middle of a sweaty night in Las Vegas, all 6’4” of Dan Reynolds is hunched over a laptop, slapping beats on the table and crooning lyrics into a tiny microphone.  Before long, he and the other three members of pop rock band Imagine Dragons would be playing “It’s Time,” that same laptop-demo-turned-supersized-anthem, from the roof of a parking garage to a wave of thousands of screaming fans.  This song title to the single from their 2012 debut KidInaKorner/Interscope release “Continued Silence EP” is an all too apt descriptor of the band’s hard-earned success—but it’s also emblematic of the deep-seated anxiety Reynolds and the rest of the band experienced leaving behind any realistic expectation of a normal job to do the thing they love most. 

A third-generation Las Vegas native, Reynolds is no stranger to the adage “the house always wins,” choosing to pave his musical career with a near obsessive work ethic and hundreds of unused demos rather than roll the dice with the first songs that sprung from his mouth.  It’s no surprise, then, that he was drawn to guitarist Wayne Sermon, another founding member of Imagine Dragons.  Having practically grown up in a recording studio and graduated Berklee College of Music, Wayne had been practicing his guitar through meals and other socially inappropriate situations as long as he could remember; he challenged Dan in a way that was both uncomfortable and exactly what they both needed.  When they began writing songs together and recognized something special was happening, Wayne called up his Berklee friend Ben McKee, who promptly dropped out of school with only a few credits left, moving across the country to play bass for the band.  This sort of reckless/genius behavior is typical for Ben, who has an uncanny penchant for spicy food and a suitcase full of unbelievable road stories.  More recently, the band was joined by drummer Daniel Platzman, another Bostonian schoolmate who seems way too nice to be playing rock and roll until you actually see him in action.

Several tours and three self-released EPs later, Imagine Dragons had made a serious name for itself, particularly in the west coast circuit.  Although their songs vary from nearly whimsical and light to brooding and powerful, listeners are drawn to the inherent honesty in the music.  The only rule of thumb for the band, it seems, is to write from a true place; the result is songs that literally run the spectrum of human emotion.  Attend a concert, and it becomes clear that the live performance of deeply personal songs has a real effect on people.  And the band itself is not immune, as demonstrated when Dan literally passed out into the drum set during a finale song, sending cymbals and drum stands crashing while the rest of the band played on until the close.

Great songwriting is bound to be noticed eventually.  As proof that the harder you work, the luckier you get, one of those people who noticed was Grammy winning producer Alex da Kid (Eminem, Rihanna).  Alex and Dan began collaborating on projects, and soon the band had developed a relationship with Alex and his team.  The alchemy resulting from Alex’s hip hop sensibilities and Imagine Dragons’ anthemic rock is nothing short of explosive.  The byproduct of this creative collision is “Continued Silence,” a six song in-your-face sonic grenade that breaks musical boundaries and yet is strangely relatable by its improbably diverse audience. 

Despite it all, on any given day when they aren’t on the road playing shows, you can still find Imagine Dragons huddled away in a rehearsal room somewhere, banging out song after song in search of the next perfect track.  Like most things in Vegas, the band is angled at going big or going bust.  For the sake of those who love great music, we hope it’s the former. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Imagine+Dragons"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

13,13,zayn,1868816,95644644,"Zayn Malik is a multi-talented English singer-songwriter best known as one of the founding members of the boy-band-of-a-generation One Direction. Born Zain Javadd Malik on January 12, 1993 in the working-class town of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England, Zayn honed his vocal talents and stage command at a young age. Growing up as a mixed race Pakistani-English Muslim in a postindustrial British town presented some difficulties, which resulted in a number of primary school changes. His talents were eventually fostered at Tong High School, where he delved into performing arts and stage production, even starring as Danny Zuko in the school's production of Grease. In 2010, he auditioned for The X Factor but was eliminated (along with his future One Direction bandmates, who also auditioned solo). The quintet was later brought back as a group and Simon Cowell dubbed them One Direction. Despite finishing in third place, their popularity exploded and would not slow their trajectory until the very end.

After the show, Cowell immediately signed them to his label, Syco Records, kicking off a craze that hadn't been seen since the turn of the millennium with the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC. From 2011 to 2014, One Direction released an album each year, each one more successful than the last. Their fourth album, Four, would turn out to be the last with Zayn. In March 2015, while the band was on the On the Road Again Tour, Malik abruptly parted ways with One Direction a week after his final appearance with the group in Hong Kong. Citing stress and a desire for a simpler life out of the spotlight, Malik later revealed that he simply wanted to make music that he could listen to and enjoy.

Striking out on his own, he signed with RCA Records and moved to Los Angeles, where he began working on his solo effort with Naughty Boy (Beyoncé, Sam Smith). The two soon parted and Malik turned to Frank Ocean collaborator James ""Malay"" Ho for production help. His debut single, ""Pillowtalk,"" was released in late January 2016, debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, and featured a distinctly more adult-themed alt-R&B sound, similar to the Weeknd and Miguel. His full-length debut, Mind of Mine, was released in early 2016 and topped the Billboard 200 chart. Late that year, he returned with the single ""I Don't Wanna Live Forever,"" a collaboration with Taylor Swift and Bleachers' Jack Antonoff that appeared on the soundtrack to Fifty Shades Darker. Second studio album, ""Icarus Falls,"" was released in December 2018. The album contains 27 tracks including six previous singles he has been released. His song with Sia, ""Dusk Till Dawn"" and and his song with PartyNextDoor, ""Still Got Time"" were initially only in Japanese edition of the record. However, in August 2020 these songs were added to the tracklist in streaming services internationally.

In September 2020, Zayn released ""Better"" which is the lead single of his third album ""Nobody Is Listening"" . Later, on January, one week before the album release, Zayn released ""Vibez"" as second single from the album. One week later Zayn released the album. Zayn described this album as ""his most personal project"".

Malik has now been released by RCA Records and is an free agent he remains at his home in Pennsylvania recording music.

14,14,piso 21,272067,4694532,"Juan David Castaño (el llanero), David Escobar (Dim), Juan David Huertas (El profe) y Pablo Mejía (Pablito), son los integrantes del grupo que ahora suena en las emisoras de la ciudad de medellin, Piso 21.

El mayor tiene solo 26 años y el menor 21. Son jóvenes, sí, pero ya son conscientes de su éxito y más que un grupo, ellos se consideran una familia, pues lo más importante, antes de cantar, es la unión y la lealtad a su amistad.

Todo comenzó en junio del año 2007 cuando se conocieron en un asado que organizó un amigo que tenían en común. Conversando se dieron cuenta de que los cuatro eran músicos y terminaron cantando hasta las 6 de la mañana.

Días después El Profe buscó a Dim y al Llanero y les propuso formar un grupo, pero Dim dijo que sí con la condición de que también incluyeran a Pablito, quien estaba de viaje en ese momento en Contadora, Panamá.

Fue tanta la emoción y la ansiedad por crear el grupo que inmediatamente llamaron a Pablito a Panamá y el aceptó sin dudarlo.

Paso a paso
Su segundo encuentro, o mejor dicho su primer ensayo, fue en el club house de un amigo del edificio San Mitchel, en el piso 21, desde donde se podía ver la ciudad d medellin completa. Este se convirtió durante varios meses en su ensayadero oficial y era allí donde pasaban noches enteras montando las canciones.

""Durante esas noches soñábamos con que algún día escucharían nuestras composiciones en todas esas casa que veíamos desde allá"", cuenta Dim.

""Y creo que lo estamos logrando, pero ahora la idea es que también nos escuchen en aquellas de las que solo veíamos la luz, arriba en las montañas"", continúa El Profe.

Su nombre
A la hora de pensar en cómo se llamarían, dieron muchas vueltas y hasta lo consultaron con sus familias y sus profesores.

Al principio le buscaron por el lado de sus iniciales o pensaron en jugar un poco con los nombres de David y Pablo, pero luego de intentarlo por muchos lados, se les ocurrió Piso 21, pues fue a esta altura donde realmente conformaron el grupo.

Pero a este nombre también le han encontrado una metáfora, pues según ellos, indica que para arriba es adonde quieren llegar, dando pasos lentos, pero seguros y muy largos.

Precisamente antes de empezar cada concierto, el grupo se reúne para gritar su frase favorita ""Piso 21, vamos pa'arriba papá"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Piso+21"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

16,16,the weeknd,4470383,825716775,"Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, popularly known as The Weeknd (born February 16, 1990 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), is a Canadian R&B/hip-hop musician, singer-songwriter and record producer. He chose his stage name in tribute to when he was 17 years old, when, along with his friend La Mar Taylor, he dropped out of high school, took his mattress, and ""left one weekend and never came home"". However, his estranged former producer Jeremy Rose claims the name was his idea. The letter E was excluded to avoid trademark problems with the Canadian band The Weekend.

The Weeknd gained widespread critical acclaim for his three mixtapes: House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence, which he later compiled to make a remastered, three-disc album titled Trilogy after signing his record deal with Republic. In 2013, he released Kiss Land, which was considered to be his debut studio album.

In 2014, he dropped “Often,” a remix of Beyonce’s “Drunk In Love,” and “King of the Fall.” The Weeknd released two songs in collaboration with the film Fifty Shades of Grey, with Earned It becoming his solo breakout hit.

His second studio album became highly-anticipated, with riveting singles like  The Hills and Can’t Feel My Face leaving fans hungry for more. Beauty Behind the Madness was released on August 28, 2015.

His third studio album, Starboy, was released on November 25, 2016. The Daft Punk-assisted title track led the project as its first official single, released on Wednesday, September 21, 2016, before becoming his third number one track in the United States, as also his home country, Canada. The effort was a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 albums chart with over 348,000 copies sold in its first week, all eighteen tracks debuting on the Billboard Hot 100, receiving a GRAMMY Award for the Best Urban Contemporary Album, category at the 60th annual ceremony, overall for the second time in his music career and being ranked as the third most popular album of 2017 in the U.S.

Next came the My Dear Melancholy EP, released on March 30, 2018 and revolving around his breakups with Bella Hadid during summer of 2016 and Selena Gomez in October 2017. With the lead single, Call Out My Name, the Canadian singer earned the largest first-day Spotify stream count of any song released in 2018 at that time and his eighth Top 10 entry on Hot 100.

Tesfaye’s fourth studio album (and his first in three years), After Hours was officially released on March 20, 2020, and is named after a 1985 movie directed by his idol, Martin Scorsese. It was primarily supported by November 2019-released singles Heartless and Blinding Lights, with the pair becoming his fourth and fifth #1 singles in the US and the latter his first #1 single in the UK. The title track and In Your Eyes were also released as singles.

Although widely expected to receive multiple nominations for After Hours, Tesfaye failed to receive any nominations for the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021). Tesfaye took to his social media to criticize the Recording Academy, claiming corruption. Speculation arose that the announcement of his then-upcoming Super Bowl performance as well as the discrepancy of being nominated as pop music versus R&B contributed to the snubs. On February 5, 2021 The Highlights was released, as his second greatest hits album. Tesfaye performed at the Super Bowl LV halftime show on February 7, 2021 after announcing he would perform in November 2020. He reportedly spent $7 million on his performance at the show. Despite having a mixed response, the show resulted in a surge in streaming and downloads for Tesfaye's After Hours album as well as for the seven other songs he performed.

His fifth album, Dawn FM was released on January 7, 2022, continuing the writing and production work with Swedish pop svengalis Max Martin and Oscar Holter. The album was preceded by the single Take My Breath in August 2021, with Sacrifice announced as the second single. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She is a Latin-influenced pop performer who first came to prominence as a founding member of the girl group Fifth Harmony. Born in Cojimar, Cuba, Cabello moved to Miami, Florida at the age of six. Growing up in a Spanish-speaking environment (born to a Cuban mother and Mexican father), she fostered her love of music by listening to Celia Cruz and Alejandro Fernández. At the age of 15, she auditioned for The X Factor in Greensboro, North Carolina. Even though she was eliminated (along with her four future groupmates), Simon Cowell recognized her talent and combined the girls to form the quintet girl group Fifth Harmony.

Despite finishing in third place, they went on to be the most successful contestants from that season. The group's debut EP, Better Together, was released in October 2013, with acoustic reworkings, Spanish versions (Juntos and Juntos Acoustic), and a remix album following a month later. Their debut single, ""Miss Movin' On,"" was the highest-charting U.S. X Factor single at the time, a feat beaten only by each successive Fifth Harmony single.

The group's debut LP, Reflection, was released in early 2015, featuring the hits ""Sledgehammer"" (written by Meghan Trainor) and ""Worth It,"" featuring rapper Kid Ink. While backstage on Taylor Swift's 1989 world tour, Cabello wrote a duet with Canadian singer/songwriter Shawn Mendes. ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was released in November 2015 and immediately hit the Billboard Top 20.

The promotional (non-album) single,""I Have Questions,"" was released a few days later. She also joined Bruno Mars as the opening act on his 24K Magic World Tour. New writing and recording sessions for her album were influenced by the success of her single ""Havana"" featuring Young Thug, which postponed its original release date and influenced the change of the record name from “The Hurting, The Healing, The Loving.” to “Camila.”

In early 2018, she returned with her debut full-length solo album, Camila, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. It featured production by Frank Dukes, Jarami, and others.

The song debuted at number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and marks Mendes' and Cabello's second collaboration, following ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" released in 2015. In August, ""Señorita"" climbed to the number one position, making it Cabello's second single to top the Hot 100 chart as lead artist. According to the IFPI, ""Señorita"" was the third best-selling song of 2019 globally. She was featured on Ed Sheeran's ""South of the Border"" along with American rapper Cardi B, released in July 2019.

23,23,the neighbourhood,3222407,282724050,"The Neighbourhood is an American alternative rock/dark pop band that formed in Newbury Park, California, USA in August 2011. The band consists of Jesse Rutherford, Jeremy Freedman, Zach Abels, and Mikey Margott. Brandon Fried (drums) was kicked out of the band on November 15 2022 after groping allegations. Bryan Sammis (drums) left the group in January 2014.

The band released their first EP, I'm Sorry... in January 2013, where their single Sweater Weather reached #1 in the U.S. Alternative Tracks and #8 on the U.S. Rock Tracks and #33 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also charted at #68 in Canada. Their first album, I Love You. was released on April 23, 2013. 

In early 2012 a mysterious band appeared online. The group, The Neighbourhood, revealed no biographical information, no photos and no backstory, offering only a moody track titled ""Female Robbery."" Fans and the press were confounded, scouring the Internet for any information that might lead them to the identity of these musicians. Pieces of the puzzle, some reflecting reality and some not so much, began to emerge. The Neighbourhood were a quintet. They were from California despite the British spelling of their name. They had a second track, ""Sweater Weather,"" which had an accompanying -- and equally dark -- video.

Although The Neighbourhood's identity remained hazy, it became clear that the music they were making felt transformative to critics and fans alike. The evocative combination of rock instruments with R&B and hip-hop aesthetics seemed, in many ways, revelatory, a reimagining of sounds that seemed to make people clamour for more information with even greater fervour. In April, BBC Radio One DJ Zane Lowe, an early champion of the group, let it slip that The Neighbourhood was the handiwork of musician Jesse Rutherford, a resident of Newbury Park, CA. By early May, as the band unveiled a free, self-released EP titled ""I'm Sorry,"" it became understood that the identity of this young band was, ultimately, secondary to the music itself.

So who is The Neighbourhood? In essence, the group, which was formed in August 2011, is a collection of five friends who make music together. They're headed by Rutherford, a 21-year-old singer who has dabbled in various genres, including hip-hop, before crafting the merge of sounds that categorizes The Neighbourhood's style. Their debut EP was produced by Justyn Pilbrow, who brought Emile Haynie on board to collaborate on ""Female Robbery."" The EP, recorded at the end of last year, is composed of shadowy, emotional music with visuals to match. And it's all part of the band's master plan.

""I always have a strong vision before I go into anything,"" Rutherford says. ""I don't know how to make music any other way. It was all in my head, and that vision for the music was to make hip-hop beats with guitars and I was going to sing and rap over them. We wanted to do that hip-hop aesthetic on an indie platform.""

""I'm Sorry,"" a five-song disc, is a precursor to the band's debut album, which is also being produced by Pilbrow and Haynie. The album, expected out in March 2013, will expand the group's moody sensibility, which pairs brooding layers of instrumentals with Rutherford's hip-hop-inspired croon. The style, which the band has dubbed ""black and white"" due to its confident inspirations, is based largely on rhythm, as evidenced by the EP. ""When I started in music I started doing drums and then I started doing vocals,"" Rutherford explains. ""And then I combined the two together because to me rapping is just rhythmic vocals. I think the rhythm of hip-hop is really what got me into it. It's not just words being said; it's about how the words are said.""

In the end, all you need to know about The Neighbourhood is in that music and in those words. There are more facts, more pieces of the puzzle, more information to unveil. But what's the fun in being given the full picture when you can slowly discover it for yourself? It's better to leave some mystery lingering. Because, after all, it's that unknowing that brought The Neighbourhood to people's attention to begin with. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Neighbourhood"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

26,26,natti natasha,306648,4361358,"Natalia Alexandra Gutiérrez, known by her stage name Natti Natasha, is a Dominican reggaeton singer, songwriter, and actress. Hailing from Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Natasha grew up surrounded by endless musical influences and enrolled in Santiago’s School of Fine Arts at the age of seven where she developed her singing abilities, describing her time at the school as “one of the best of her life.” Her studio experience would begin as a teenager when she would record songs as a hobby and later alongside friends.

This all led up to her decision to make the biggest and riskiest move of her life, and that was to move to the United States. She settled in the Bronx, New York, or “the City of the Dreams and Dreamers” for young, aspiring musicians like her at the time. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Natti called the move “one of the craziest moves anyone ever did in her family,” and that she often looks back at the decision and wonders what she was doing. Natti would hop from studio to studio, working without pay, but to her, this was a way to get her name out there. A producer friend from Santiago would soon step in and lend her his New York studio.

Natti’s first-ever break came when icon Don Omar signed her to his record label, the Orfanato Music Group, and the pair would go on to make history for years to come. Their collaborations “Dutty Love,” “Tus Movimientos,” “Perdido en tus Ojos,” and a “Hold Ya” remix with Gyptian made waves across Latin America and introduced the world to future reggaeton royalty. Her debut project, an EP titled “All About Me” was released on March 28, 2012.

Natti would continue to make big career moves throughout the years including her departure from Don Omar’s record label and signing onto Pina Records in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2017 when her big breakout would come once and for all. Not only did she record and release a collaboration titled “Otra Cosa” alongside the legendary Daddy Yankee, but she also released what was arguably the biggest song of 2017. “Criminal” featuring Ozuna became an instant hit upon its release, the music video amassing over 1 billion views in just five months and becoming the most watched music video by a female singer released that year.

2019 saw the release of her much-anticipated debut album, “ilumiNATTI,” on February 15. 15 tracks made up the project with two collaborations in total, “Te Lo Dije'' with Anitta and “Soy Mía” with Kany García. Standout track “La Mejor Version de Mi” would transform into a bachata hit with its remix featuring bachata king Romeo Santos.

Natti’s sophomore album titled “NATTIVIDAD” would be released two years later on September 24, 2021 with 17 tracks featuring several chart-topping collaborators such as Becky G, Maluma, and Prince Royce. The release was followed up by the six-episode docuseries titled “Everybody Loves Natti” which documented her pregnancy and relationship with fiancé Raphy Pina. The series premiered on November 19, 2021 on Amazon Prime Video and was generally well received. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Natti+Natasha"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Born Daniel Martín Garcia in Madrid in 1977, he regularly entertained his family with impersonations of his favorite singers as a child and received his first taste of exposure as a 14-year-old on the TVE show Rock Out. 

After attending the Cristina Rota and William Layton drama schools, he teamed up with guitarist Iván Ganchegui in 1994 to form El Canto del Loco, who went through various lineup changes before releasing their 2000 self-titled debut album. The band went on to become one of Spain's biggest pop/rock acts, scoring four chart-topping albums, A Contracorriente (2002), Estados de Ánimo (2003), Zapatillas (2005), and Personas (2008), in a hugely successful six-year period.

However, Martín simultaneously continued to showcase his acting talents, appearing on both the big screen in gay-themed comedy I Love You Baby, Bigas Luna's comedy Yo Soy la Juani, and Pedro Almodóvar's Broken Embraces, plus the small screen in medical drama Hospital Central, cop show Four Countdown, and sitcom Los Hombres de Paco.

35,35,ellie goulding,3346543,125561969,"Ellie Goulding (born Elena Jane Goulding, 30 December 1986 in Hereford, England) is an English singer-songwriter. Having caught the public's attention in 2010 with her singles ""Starry Eyed"" and ""Guns and Horses,"" British vocalist Ellie Goulding quickly rose to the top of the charts with her infectious electronic pop sound. Although she started out writing songs in a folk-inflected style, she eventually grew into a more electronic-influenced artist, touching upon dance music and ambient synth pop. With her unique soprano warble and knack for writing catchy yet emotionally earnest songs, Goulding, much like her predecessors Kate Bush and Imogen Heap, stands at the forefront of contemporary mainstream music and arty, independent-minded pop.

Born in Hereford, England, she later moved to the country's east coast to study drama at the University of Kent. Goulding had developed a love for folk music as a teenager, and her time at university also exposed her to electronica. After two years, she took a break from her studies and moved to West London, where she pursued a career as an alternative singer/songwriter and befriended producers like Starsmith and Frankmusik, who gave her songs an electro-pop twist. In 2009, Goulding began building an audience via the Internet, where early tracks like ""Starry Eyed"" and a cover of Sam Sparro's ""Black & Gold"" were posted on tastemaking MP3 blogs such as Discodust. Goulding soon graduated from the blogosphere to print media, gaining praise from mainstream publications like The Guardian and fielding offers from record labels. She ultimately signed a major-label deal with Polydor Records and began making preparations to release her debut album. In the meantime, she penned songs for Diana Vickers, Gabriella Climi, and others.

During the final weeks of 2009, Goulding topped the BBC's Sound of 2010, a poll conducted by British music critics and industry insiders to identify new talent. Building on that momentum, she released Lights -- a sparkling debut album that splashed Goulding's vocal flutter across a landscape of acoustic and synthesized instruments -- in March 2010. Lights topped the U.K. charts during its first week and spun off ""Starry Eyed"" as a Top Five single (it also charted well in Ireland and New Zealand). Later that year, the album was re-released as Bright Lights, featuring seven new recordings (including a cover of Elton John's ""Your Song,"" which peaked at number two).

In 2012, Goulding returned with her sophomore album, Halcyon, which showcased an even more sonically adventurous, electro-pop-infused sound. In 2013, a deluxe reissue featuring ten extra songs was released; entitled Halcyon Days, it acted as a supplement to the original release. Two of its new songs, ""Burn"" and ""How Long Will I Love You,"" were among her biggest hits. The following year, she was featured on Calvin Harris' Top Ten U.K. hit ""Outside,"" participated in Band Aid 30's update of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?,"" and entered the U.K. Top Ten once more with ""Beating Heart,"" a song released on the soundtrack for Divergent. Another soundtrack single, ""Love Me Like You Do,"" added to the success of Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015.

That same year, Goulding released her third studio album, Delirium, which featured collaborations with Max Martin, Greg Kurstin, and others. The pop-leaning Delirium included the single ""On My Mind"" and peaked at number three on the U.S. and U.K. charts. Goulding returned in 2017 on ""First Time,"" a collaboration with electronic producer Kygo.

In 2018, Goulding joined Tap Management after almost a decade with First Access Management.[107] She appeared on a collaboration with Sean Paul on his Mad Love the Prequel EP titled ""Bad Love"", released on 29 June 2018.[108]

On 12 April 2019, Goulding released the single ""Sixteen"".[113] Goulding said of the single, ""...That age was such a pivotal year for me in many ways and this song is so close to my heart. It takes me back to the reckless days of being a teenager and I hope it reminds us all about the innocence of youth.""[114]

Goulding released ""Hate Me"" with American rapper Juice Wrld on 26 June 2019.[115][116] It was premiered by Zane Lowe as his 'World Record' on Beats 1.[117] In July, Goulding stated that her next material to be released would be the songs ""Woman I Am"" and ""Start"".[118] In November, she released her rendition of Joni Mitchell's Christmas song ""River"", which topped the UK Singles Chart, becoming her third UK number one single and the last UK number one song of the 2010s.[119]

On 13 March 2020, Goulding released the new single ""Worry About Me"" which was created in-collaboration with Blackbear.[120] In a radio interview with Heart the same month, she revealed that the album ""kind of comes in two parts"", adding that ""the first side is something written entirely by me which was fun and I wrote most of it in New York when I was living there a few years back. I play the guitar and I play the bass and piano and then I'm singing a lot of vocals. It's very classically influenced because I love classical music. There's a lot going on, it's a big soundscape and one big film. The second half is my kind of alter ego songs.""[121] On 21 May she released single ""Power"" and on 30 June single ""Slow Grenade"" with Lauv.

Goulding released her fourth studio album, Brightest Blue, on 17 July 2020. Originally scheduled for 5 June 2020, the album's release was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album debuted at the top of the UK Album Chart, becoming Goulding's third album to do so,[122] as well as at No. 2 in Scotland.[123] It reached the top 10 in Ireland[124] as well as the top 40 in over ten countries including Australia, Germany and the United States.

Goulding announced on an Instagram Q&A that she would be releasing new music which was not part of the Brightest Blue era at the end of January 2021.[125] On 21 January, she released a collaboration with electronic duo Silk City, titled ""New Love"".[126] On 30 September, Goulding performed ""Anything Could Happen"" as part of the opening ceremony for Expo 2020, held in Dubai.[127]

On 19 June 2022, Goulding performed at Rock in Rio in Lisbon, Portugal. After the concert, she announced that she would be releasing new music in July. The following day, she blacked out all her social media profiles.[128] Back in July 2021, during an interview with Joe Wicks, she described the forthcoming album as ""a dance record. It's electronic pop, a dance thing from outer space"".[129] On 4 July 2022, she announced the release of ""Easy Lover"" featuring Big Sean, which was released on 15 July.[130] The single did not enter the UK Singles Top 100, but peaked at number 31 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart Top 100.[131] It was followed by ""All by Myself"", a collaboration between Goulding and producers Alok and Sigala, on 7 October.[132] Goulding released the single ""Let It Die"" along with its video on 19 October and announced the same day that her fifth studio album Higher Than Heaven would be released on 3 February 2023.[133][134]

Following several lineup changes, Panic! began operating as the solo project of frontman Urie from 2015 until the project's discontinuation in 2023.

Panic! at the Disco recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Popularized by the second single, ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, Pretty. Odd. (2008), was preceded by the single ""Nine in the Afternoon"". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. In 2009, Ross and Walker formed a new band, the Young Veins, leaving Urie and Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco.

Continuing as a duo, Urie and Smith released a new single, ""New Perspective"", for the movie Jennifer's Body, and recruited bassist Dallon Weekes and guitarist Ian Crawford as touring musicians for live performances. Weekes was later inducted into the band's lineup as a full-time member in 2010. The band's third studio album, Vices & Virtues (2011), was recorded solely by Urie and Smith in 2010, produced by John Feldmann and Butch Walker. Crawford departed once the tour cycle for Vices & Virtues ended in 2012.

As a three-piece, Urie, Smith, and Weekes recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, in 2013. Prior to the release of the album, Smith unofficially left the band due to health and drug-related issues, leaving Urie and Weekes as the remaining members. The duo recruited guitarist Kenneth Harris and drummer Dan Pawlovich as touring musicians for live performances.

In 2015, Smith officially left the band after not performing live with them since his departure in 2013. Shortly thereafter, Weekes reverted to being a touring member once again, resulting in Panic! becoming Urie's solo project. In April 2015, ""Hallelujah"" was released as the first single from Panic! at the Disco's fifth studio album, Death of a Bachelor (2016). In December 2017, Weekes officially announced his departure from the band.

Austin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York. He was raised by his father, Richard Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip-hop, country, and rock. When Malone was nine years old, he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys. Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game Guitar Hero.

Malone has always had a love for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event. According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band. He says soon afterward he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip-hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.

According to Malone, he chose ""Post Malone"" as his stage name when he was 14 or 15. The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone, but Malone later explained that ""Post"" is his last name, and he used a ""rap name generator"" to get ""Malone"". At 16, using the audio editor Audacity, Malone created his first mixtape, Young and After Them Riches. He showed it to some of his classmates at Grapevine High School. He was voted ""Most Likely to Become Famous"" by his classmates as a senior in high school. He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.

Malone later enrolled in Tarrant County College but dropped out. After leaving college, Malone moved to Los Angeles, California, with his longtime friend Jason Probst, a professional game streamer.

After moving to Los Angeles, Malone, Probst, and several other producers and artists formed the music group BLCKVRD and recorded music together. Several members of the group, including Malone, moved into a house in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley together. While living in the San Fernando Valley, Malone met record producers FKi 1st and Sauce Lord Rich, who formed the production team FKi, as well as Rex Kudo, who produced several of Malone's tracks, including ""White Iverson"".

In June 2016, XXL editor-in-chief Vanessa Satten revealed Malone was considered for XXL's ""2016 Freshman Class"" magazine cover, but she was ""told by his camp that he wasn't paying attention to hip hop so much.

In August 2016, Malone issued an apology for his album, Stoney, being late. It was available for pre-order on November 4 and was finally released on December 9.

49,49,maroon 5,5667780,212359604,"Maroon 5 are an American pop rock band that originated in Los Angeles, California, United States. The group was formed in 1994 as Kara's Flowers while its members were still in high school and originally consisted of Adam Levine (lead vocals, guitar), Jesse Carmichael (guitar, backing vocals) Mickey Madden (bass guitar) and Ryan Dusick (drums). Kara's Flowers signed to Reprise Records and released an album, ""The Fourth World"", in 1997. After a tepid response to the album, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college. Dusick and Madden stayed local at UCLA, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the east coast to attend Five Towns College. While Levine and Carmichael were in New York, they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote.

In 2001, the band regrouped, with guitarist James Valentine added to the line-up, and pursued a new direction under the name: Maroon 5. At this point, Jesse Carmichael switched to playing the keyboards and this has become his main instrument in the band (although he also plays rhythm guitar to this day). After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with Octone Records and released their debut album, ""Songs About Jane"", in June 2002. The album's lead single ""Harder to Breathe"", received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. For the next few years, the band toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and produced two live recordings: 2004's ""1.22.03.Acoustic"" and 2005's ""Live Friday the 13th"". In 2006, Ryan Dusick officially left the band after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn.

The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single, ""Makes Me Wonder"", became the band's first number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100.

On September 21, 2010, the band released their third studio album entitled ""Hands All Over"". It was re-released in 2011 to include the single ""Moves like Jagger"" (featuring Christina Aguilera). While the original version of the album received mixed reviews, ""Moves like Jagger"" reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The band released their next album, ""Overexposed"", on June 26, 2012. All four singles of the album were really successful on the charts - for example, the second single from Overexposed, ""One More Night"" (released on June 19, 2012), reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2014, the band signed with Interscope Records and released their fifth studio album, ""V"", with the very-first line-up of six official band members, as keyboardist and backing vocalist PJ Morton became an official member in 2012.

62,62,doja cat,2914613,344947758,"Doja Cat rose from viral novelty track buzz to mainstream superstar with her smooth, hypnotic, R&B-flecked pop songs of sexuality, friendship, and personal power. She gained some significant attention with her early releases, but it was her 2019 sophomore effort, Hot Pink, that took her to the top of the Hot 100. Subsequent charting singles and collaborations with SZA and Saweetie further solidified her star power, and made the arrival of her 2021 album Planet Her all the more hotly anticipated. A number two Billboard 200 hit, Planet Her also earned several Grammy nominations. Singles followed, including her savvy 2022 cover of Hole's ""Celebrity Skin"" 2022's ""Vegas"" off the Elvis soundtrack, and 2023's trip-hop-inflected ""Attention"" all of which spotlighted Doja's adventurous, genre-crossing sensibilities. The latter track and ""Paint the Town Red"" appeared on her fourth album, 2023's Scarlet, which found her digging deep into her rap and hip-hop roots and became her third consecutive album to hit the Top Ten of the Billboard 200. Doja Cat was born Amala Zandile Dlamini in 1995 in Tarzana, California, the daughter of South African actor Dumisani Dlamini and painter Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer. After moving to New York for a few years, she returned to California with her mother. As a child, she studied piano and took tap, ballet, and jazz dance lessons. She also discovered surfing and breakdancing. By her teens, she was teaching herself to sing and listening to an eclectic mix of hip-hop, indie rock, R&B, and electronic music. Doja also began recording songs on her computer and in 2014 released her debut EP, Purrr! She quickly found herself with a viral hit with the track ""So High"" More singles followed, including the languid ""Nunchucks"" and ""No Police"" each one grabbing attention online. Another single, ""Mooo!"" arrived in 2018 and quickly went viral. On the heels of that success, Doja Cat issued her full-length debut album, Amala, which found her expanding upon her dreamy, meme-friendly sound with more hip-hop-, pop-, and R&B-infused tracks, including ""Candy"" and ""Roll with Us"" In 2019, she issued an expanded version of Amala that added the singles ""Juicy"" and ""Tia Tamera"" featuring Rico Nasty. Her sophomore album, Hot Pink, was quick to follow; with features from Smino, Gucci Mane, and Tyga, the 2019 LP leaned more into the sexually wry aspects of her ever-shifting persona. A Top Ten hit on the Billboard 200, the album's fifth single, ""Say So"" pushed her even further up the charts. After making a steady rise in the Hot 100 at the start of 2020, the multi-platinum track finally hit number one in May, boosted by a Nicki Minaj remix. After picking up a couple of American Music Awards, Doja carried the momentum from her breakout year into 2021. She began appearing alongside established celebrities more frequently, adding a guest feature to Saweetie's single ""Best Friend"" contributing to an Ariana Grande remix with Megan Thee Stallion, and releasing the SZA-assisted single ""Kiss Me More"" All of this led up to the June 2021 release of her third full-length studio album, Planet Her. It featured guest spots from Young Thug, The Weeknd, JID, and others, and its cover art was shot by photographer David LaChapelle. The album, which reached number two on the Billboard 200 and topped the R&B albums chart, also garnered Grammy nominations for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album.

65,65,anne-marie,1015962,17736050,"Essex, England-born Anne-Marie Nicholson was no stranger to performing by the time her debut EP dropped in 2015, having shared the stage as a 12-year-old with none other than Jessie J in a West End production of Whistle Down the Wind. She also auditioned for Les Misérables without telling her parents, and was offered a part. It was a risk that paid off, as it served to open her parents' eyes to her singing ability. Aside from West End commitments, the intervening years between her days as a child star and the advent of her career as a pop singer were spent becoming a world karate champion no fewer than three times, an art form she credited with teaching her discipline and focus, two essential traits of becoming a successful musician.

After a chance meeting with an aspiring singer/songwriter, she managed to secure some studio time in Elton John's Rocket Studios, and, after hearing what she could do, she was subsequently picked up by Elton's management company Rocket Music. Anne-Marie released a demo in 2013 entitled Summer Girl, which drew some attention to the singer, most notably garnering a fan in Ed Sheeran. Despite the encouraging start to her solo career, things were put on hold to give her more time to develop as an artist.

Having guested on tracks by dubstep supergroup Magnetic Man, London-based garage duo Gorgon City, and progressive house trio Raized by Wolves, Anne-Marie caught the attention of Brit and MOBO award winners Rudimental. She was featured alongside Dizzee Rascal and Will Heard on two tracks from their second album, 2015's We the Generation, and spent two years touring with the band, playing some of the world's biggest stages and best-known festivals.

The summer of that year also saw the release of Anne-Marie's debut EP on Rudimental's then-new record label, Major Tom's. The aptly titled Karate EP featured three tracks and a Chloe Martini remix, and producers Josh Record and Two Inch Punch worked with her on the record. Both the lead single ""Karate,"" a slick fusion of electro-grime and R&B, and the follow-up ""Gemini,"" garnered some very positive reviews and led Anne-Marie to gigging as a solo artist. In early 2016, the single ""Do It Right"" reached the U.K. charts, and several months later ""Alarm"" hit the Top 40 in several charts around the world.

In 2017, Anne-Marie scored a hit single when she featured on Clean Bandit's multi-platinum ""Rockabye"" with Sean Paul. The song topped the charts across Europe and in Australia, breaking into the Top Ten in Canada and the U.S. She followed with the solo singles ""Ciao Adios"" and ""Heavy,"" which both charted in the U.K. and Ireland. Both tracks appeared on her debut full-length, Speak Your Mind, which saw release in April 2018. The record also featured the track ""Friends,"" written and recorded with American dance producer Marshmello. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Anne-Marie"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After several years of learning to master the piano, Anton began playing the drums in a band, and composed and produced numerous rocksongs in his band's own studio. In 2009 he began producing electronic clubmusic, to much and quick acclaim. After a period of only few months he attained a remarkable level and participated in Beatport's ""Armand Van Helden / Strictly Rhythm Remix Contest"", which he went on to win. This opened up a number of new possibilities for Zedd, and only shortly after, he won his second contest on Beatport, the ""Fatboy Slim / Skint Remix Contest""! This was the foundation for several cooperations with artists such as Black Eyed Peas, Lady Gaga, P. Diddy, Skrillex, Fatboy Slim, Armand Van Helden and labels like mau5trap, Interscope, Atlantic, Strictly Rhythm or Skint Records. His first release ""The Anthem"" entered the Beatport charts top 20, and even made it to the second place of Track It Down charts. His remix for Skrillex' 'Scary Monsters And Nice Sprites', released on 'mau5trap recordings' climbed up the charts to #4 on Beatport and #2 on Beatport's Electro House charts. Zedd released his single ""Shave It"" on October 4th 2011 via Beatport under Skrillex's new label OWSLA. ""Shave It"" is Zedd's first single with OWSLA. One of the reasons for this rapid development is undoubtedly Zedd's unique and highly recognizable style of composition. It stands out as very detailed and carefully produced Electro House, very playful and the same time remarkably catchy.

68,68,mark ronson,2650797,42247633,"Mark Ronson  (born 4 September 1975) is a sought-after producer, who's worked with such diverse artists as Miley Cyrus, Jay-Z, Lily Allen, Robbie Williams, Bruno Mars, Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Duran Duran and comedian Jimmy Fallon. 

Born in London, he is the son of writer Ann Dexter-Jones and real estate tycoon Laurence Ronson. His mother later married Mick Jones, lead guitarist of multiplatinum selling rock band Foreigner. He has two sisters: fashion designer Charlotte Ronson and DJ Samantha Ronson. He spent his childhood in a wealthy suburb of London where he lived on the same street as Paul McCartney‘s family. When his parents divorced at age 8, he moved to New York, where he made friends with John Lennon's son, Sean Lennon.

Ronson played guitar and drums from an early age, but it wasn't until moving to New York City with his mother that Ronson discovered DJ culture. At age 16, already a fan of such popular hip-hop artists as Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys, Ronson began listening to the various hip-hop mixtapes released every few months by DJs. Inspired, Ronson confiscated his father's record collection and began trying his hand at mixing. 

The young DJ with the diverse taste soon caught the ears and eyes of various socialites and New York celebrities, including fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger, who featured Ronson along with other sons and daughters of celebrities in a 1997 fashion campaign. A year later, hip-hop mogul Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs hired Ronson to DJ his fabled 29th birthday bash. These and other high-profile gigs boosted Ronson's ""hip quotient"" and helped promote his more serious-minded music career. Fusing his eclectic turntable skills with his knowledge of musical instruments and songwriting, Ronson eventually embarked on his first solo project. Featuring such diverse guest artists as dancehall rapper Sean Paul, hip-hop artist Mos Def, Jack White of the White Stripes, and Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, Ronson's debut album, Here Comes the Fuzz, bowed for Elektra in 2003.

Ronson's second album, Version, adds to his eclectic style. In this sophomore album, Ronson fuses a range of musical genres from Daniel Merriweather to Ol' Dirty Bastard to Phantom Planet with an up tempo contemporary funk sound. All the songs on this album are covers of previous Billboard top-10 pop songs, with a jazzy twist.

Career

Attending Vassar College and then New York University (NYU), Ronson became a regular at downtown hip-hop spots and made his name as a DJ on the New York club scene in 1993. He was soon one of the most respected DJs and was being called on for celebrities' private parties. Ronson is known for his diverse, genre-spanning selection, influenced by both the hip-hop scene of New York and the more rock influence of the UK, amongst others.

He moved on, however, to producing music. After producing Nikka Costa's song ""Everybody Got Their Something,"" Ronson signed a record contract with Elektra Records. His first album Here Comes the Fuzz was released in 2003 and was a critically acclaimed success that featured artists of all genres, despite initially poor sales. The most well known song from the album, "" Ooh Wee"" samples "" Sunny"" by Boney M and features Nate Dogg, Ghostface Killah, and Trife Da God. He has since produced multiple songs on the albums of singers Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse, Lily Allen, and Robbie Williams.

In 2004, he formed his own record label, Allido Records, a subsidiary of Sony BMG's J Records, along with his longtime manager Rich Kleiman. The first artist he signed to Allido was rapper Rhymefest, most well-known for winning the Grammy for co-writing Kanye West's ""Jesus Walks"".

In March 2006, Ronson released a cover of Radiohead's "" Just"" as a single. In certain areas, such as the UK, it gained major radio play. It also saw release as part of Exit Music: Songs with Radio Heads, a full Radiohead covers CD, in April, later appearing on Ronson's second album, Version, which was released in the UK on 16 April 2007. It includes other covers of a diverse selection of rock & pop songs including: Kaiser Chiefs' "" Oh My God"" (featuring guest vocals from Lily Allen), an instrumental version of Coldplay's "" God Put A Smile Upon Your Face"", Britney Spears' ""Toxic"", Ryan Adams' ""Amy"", Maxïmo Park's "" Apply Some Pressure"", The Zutons' ""Valerie"" and Kasabian's ""L.S.F."".

70,70,men i trust,1717203,86402801,"Men I Trust is Dragos, Emma, Jessy, Mathieu and Alexis. Founded in 2014, the indie dance band from Montreal, Canada loves smooth sounds, calm melodies and simple rhythms that relax, but make your right foot tap and your chin bounce on the beats. They record, mix, master and shoot their music videos. 

Jessy and Dragos knew each other since their fourth year of high school. Back then (mid-2000’s), Dragos had somewhat of a background in classical piano and Jessy mastered the dark and esoteric art of the metal guitar solist.

In 2012, while finishing his master’s degree in audio postproduction at Laval University, Dragos spent most of his days and sleeping hours at the “LARC” studio working on his solo projects. He randomly met Jessy again, who was finishing his bachelor degree in Jazz guitar, in one of the faculty’s hallways and talked about doing a French-Touch / Italo-Disco track together. Some weeks later, they did just that. And it worked out so well that they decided to extend their collaboration to a whole project where many singers such as Odile Marmet-Rochefort, Gabrielle Shonk, Helena Deland and Geoffroy Sauvé, would be involved.

Between 2012 and 2016, all of Jessy’s and Dragos’ releases were made as part of Dragos’ masters and (dropped) PhD studies in order to gain access to the LARC’s infrastructure and to develop a unique sound.


Emma was a fortuitous encounter. In 2015 a mutual friend presented her to Dragos through a video posted over the Internet. She was casually singing and playing the guitar around a campfire with some of her friends. Emma’s voice was different, being less clear, more grainy and fragile with a mysterious twist that caught their attention. They reached her and tried recording one song called “Out in myself”, which turned to be one of the band’s easiest to record.

Jessy and Dragos then invited her to join them on live shows with Odile at the beginning of 2015. The womans' voices blended wonderfully together and the band got lots of positive feedback from the experience. Emma has been part of Men I Trust since then.

With their second album “Headroom"", Men I Trust truly became a trio. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Men+I+Trust"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
71,71,dua lipa,2746572,261617306,"Dua Lipa (born August 22, 1995) is an English-Albanian singer-songwriter. She was born in London of refugee parents from the Republic of Kosovo, growing up between both countries until fully moving back to London at age 15.

Dua Lipa began to write her name in the music industry. Lipa gained attention from the specialized media as an artist after the release of her debut album in 2017,  ""Dua Lipa"" (self-titled). It won the third position on the UK Albums Chart and featured eight singles. ""New Rules""  and ""IDGAF"" have become global hits, reaching the number 1 position in countries such as Australia, Belgium, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, as well as reaching the top ten positions in more than 30 countries, including the USA for ""New Rules"" . The album featured the hits ""One Kiss"" with Calvin Harris, ""Be The One"", ""Scared To Be Lonely"" with Martin Garrix, ""No Lie"" with Sean Paul and many others.  It later received 5 nominations at the BRITs Awards, the most important British awards ceremony in music. She also won with her debut album two Grammys, ""Best Dance Recording"" for her song ""Electricity"" with Silk City, and moreover the ""Best New Artist"" award. ""Dua Lipa"" (self-titled) is the most streamed female album of all-time on Spotify.

But Lipa's great success would even come in her second album ""Future Nostalgia"", which made the promising young woman a true pillar of world pop music. Having hits such as ""Don't Start Now"", ""Break My Heart"" and ""Levitating"" , the album is currently the most played female album of the 2020's decade on Spotify and secured a Grammy at the 2021 ceremony for ""Best Pop Vocal Album"" and was present among the nominations for ""Album of the Year"". It also won the Brit Award for ""Album of the Year"". ""Future Nostalgia"" is the 2nd most streamed female album of all-time on Spotify. ""Don't Start Now"" became her most streamed hit on Spotify, nominated for ""Record of the Year"" at the Grammys. It was the biggest female song of the year 2020.

The British phenomenon has captured an all-time record on the Billboard Hot 100, all thanks to the success of ""Levitating"". The track became the longest-charting female song on the chart, with 77 weeks, being the 4th song overall to reach this astonishing feat. The same track became the biggest hit of 2021 in the United States and globally without ever reaching #1, proving once and for all that the disputed #1 position on the Billboard Hot 100, that she still doesn't have reached, doesn't define the success of an artist. For Lipa, it seems that longevity is more important than an instant success.

Her song, ""Cold Heart""  with  Elton John and  PNAU, was one of the biggest hits of 2022. She had during that year a sold-out global stadium and arena tour with ""The Future Nostalgia Tour"", marking her as a definitive icon of the beginning of the 2020's decade, especially in the European continent, her main music market.

She began her third album cycle in 2024, while also making her acting debut that year with ""Barbie"" and ""Argylle"" in 2024.

Rudimental are an east London (UK) music quartet, comprising the songwriters and producers Piers Agget, Kesi Dryden and Amir Amor, together with DJ Locksmith. 

They have stated that they are on a mission to bring back soul into electronic music, and are quoted as saying: “We aren’t just electronic bedroom producers, and we’re not just guitarists and pianists who don’t know much about making a beat”.  They grew up on everything from grime to jazz and blues, from hip-hop to house, and state: “You can’t really box us into a category, we’re more about musicality, songwriting and broader influences. We are Sly and the Family Stone, Todd Edwards and Dr. Dre in a cheeseburger!”

The original Rudimental trio go back a long way. Piers and Locksmith grew up on the same road in Hackney, with Kesi living just around the corner in Stoke Newington, where he went to the same school as Labrinth and Professor Green.  Amir joined the collective in mid-2011 after working with them on some remixes.

The release of the single ""Heathens"" also made the group the first alternative artist in history to have two concurrent top five singles in the Billboard Hot 100 and the third rock act in history to have two singles simultaneously chart in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100, joining the Beatles and Elvis Presley.

The duo has released seven studio albums in total, with the latest being Clancy, released on May 24, 2024. They have also garnered ten No. 1 songs on the Alternative Songs chart, making them the artist with the fourth-most number-one songs on the chart, just below Linkin Park.

87,87,kodaline,1287633,26196701,"Kodaline is a Dublin-based Irish alternative rock quartet. Originally known as 21 Demands, the band made chart history in March 2007, when their debut single ""Give Me A Minute"" topped the Irish Singles Chart; becoming the first independently released track to achieve the feat. In 2005 the band made it to the final of RTE-broadcast programme 'You're a Star' in Ireland, coming in second place, and then in 2011 they changed their name to Kodaline. 

Growing up in houses just two minutes away from each other in Swords, a working class town near Dublin airport, Stephen Garrigan  and Mark Prendergast met aged eight, when they were the only boys in the school choir. Skip forward six years and they recruited Vinny May , also situated a stones throw away and together set about forming the first of myriad bands. The line-up for Kodaline was recently completed by the addition of bassist Jason Boland . The band's name, incidentally, means absolutely nothing. For the moment they wanted something they could take ownership of.

The band became a YouTube sensation with their music video for the song 'All I Want' which tells the heartbreaking beauty-and-the-beast type story. On October 4th 2013 Kodaline released another music video for this song called 'All I Want part 2"" this again tells us about the man. 

On June 17th 2013, Kodaline released their first studio album, In a Perfect World, with 11 tracks including 'All I Want', 'Pray', 'Love Like This' and 'High Hopes'. The oldest track on their album is 'High Hopes' which was based on a series of breakups that members of the band were facing during that time.

Teaching each other the principles of songcraft, the music they came up with some of which can be found on their self titled EP isn't wan or introspective or self-serving. Instead, it's bold, epic and stirring. Currently maintaining an air of understated mystery, Kodaline are soon set to unveil themselves to the world with these first four tracks recorded with Steve Harris (producer for Dave Matthews band, mixer for U2).

Singles have featured in a number of TV shows, including 'Remember the time' in Grey's Anatomy and 'All I Want' in ""The Vampire Diaries"". This song was also used ,very effectively, as the backing music in the 2012 Google Zeitgeist advert.

Kodaline have also been doing many tours recently and their last two in the UK were completely sold out. They enjoy being on the stage and are looking forwards to many festivals in the upcoming summer, such as T in the Park and the V festival.

To celebrate the beginning of 2014, Kodaline released an alternative video for their song 'One Day' on January 1st, 2014. Also, on the 15th of January, Kodaline received the EBBA for the people's choice award along with another award for the best Irish Act. This promising band has been acclaimed for their many talents and will surely continue to produce such heart-rendering music.

Kodaline have announced their second album: 'Coming Up For Air' which will be released in February 2015. A couple of the songs have already been made public. They are also going on another tour around various places in the world after it's release, starting in the amazing Glasgow Barrowlands. They will also be returning to America after their last tour was cancelled due to Jay's broken wrist.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kodaline"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

89,89,meek mill,1552279,39165945,"Robert Williams (born May 6, 1987), better known by his stage name Meek Mill, is an American rapper from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was briefly signed to T.I.'s label Grand Hustle Records and in February 2011 signed to Rick Ross' Maybach Music Group. He adopted the rap name “Meek Mill” after family and friends from his neighborhood kept referencing him by his middle name. Meek is coined as the latest rap phenomenon to come out of the city of Philadelphia.

Raised in the North Philadelphia section of the city with his sister and inspired by his mother and father; who died when he was five, Meek Mill began taking the rap game seriously at the age of 12 after losing a street battle to neighboring rappers. He says his desire to rap grew after watching his uncle Philly hip-hop pioneer Grandmaster Nell. While hanging out in his neighborhood, Meek met three guys and formed the group, “BloodHoundz,” which consisted of Mel Love, Dat Nigga Leel and Young Pooh. The group lasted for fives years and Meek ventured on his own.

With a solo career in tow, Meek became one of Philadelphia’s hottest underground rap artists on an independent label. In 2007, Meek debuted his Flamerz series, which stands for hottest songs and released his first mix tape, Flamerz 1, which featured the hit single, “In My Bag.”

In 2008, Meek debuted the highly anticipated Flamerz 2 –“Hottest In Da City,” which showcased more of his lyrical abilities with the singles, “So Fly,” “Prolli,” and “Hottest In Da City.” Upon release of Flamerz 2, it caught the attention of founder and President of 215Aphillyated Records, Charlie Mack. Mack was immediately impressed with Meek that he signed him to his management company. During the same year, he met the founder and owner of Grand Hustle, TI. TI was impressed with his lyrical ability that he offered him an opportunity to travel to Los Angeles to meet with him along with the Warner Brothers Records, within one week both record companies offered him a deal. Meek was overwhelmed by the offers; however, he felt collaborating with TI was an opportunity of a lifetime and chose his label. An ecstatic Meek was on top of the world; a record deal and the chance to work with one of hip hop’s greatest rappers and then a set back occurred. He was arrested, charged with a crime and order to serve seven months in jail.

Meek pre-released three singles from his third mix tape Flamerz 2.5 – “The Preview” in August of 2009, which featured the chart topping hits, “Make ‘Em Say,” “Imma Da Ish,” featuring Ms. Jade and “Starting Something,” in honor Michael Jackson. Within the first two weeks of its release, Clear Channel added it to their play list, which is an anomaly in the music business. In June of 2009, Meek began immediately working on his freshman album – Flamerz 3, “Hottest In America – Gangster Grill Edition,” hosted by DJ Drama and featuring the songs: “Baby Girl,” “Hottest In America,” and “I’m Killinem.” The highly anticipated cd is set to be released on January 19, 2010. Despite his stint in jail, Meek’s fans remained loyal, he currently boasts of 13 million hits on My Space and 20 million viewers on You Tube. Meek Mill has recently just signed to Rick Ross's Maybach Music Group.

In the future, Meek plans to establish the Meek Mill Foundation, which will mentor young males between the ages of 12-24 on the importance of “Education over Incarceration.” He gives a shoutout to the next artist coming up named shizz.. He also plans to collaborate with United Community Action Network and the Lifers of Graterford Prison to address the violence plaguing our cities.  To learn more about Meek, you can visit the official website: www.meekmillflamerz.com and for bookings or shows, you can call Charlie Mack at 215-910-4675 or e-mail: firstoutdalimo@aol.com. 

2015 - BEEF WITH DRAKE
In July 2015 Meek attempted to air out Drake for ""not writing his own raps"" via popular social media site Twitter. These tweets resulted in a huge reaction from the hip hop community, however, the stunt went awry when Drake (Aubrey Graham) decided to respond. Drake released the diss track ""Charged Up"" during an Apple Music stream and an immediate response from Meek was demanded. Funkmaster Flex announced he would debut Meek's response live on Hot97. However, the track never came. After four days there was still no sign of a response from Meek, prompting Drake to release a second diss track ""Back To Back."" The response to this was huge and a harsh blow to Meek's career. Two days later Meek finally released ""Wanna Know."" This track received largely negative reviews and it was clear to most that Drake had won the beef. On August 2nd at the annual OVOfest, Drake truly roasted Meek Mill; performing ""Back To Back"" in front of various memes poking fun at Meek to a raucous Toronto crowd. Many fans believed this to be the nail in the coffin spelling the end for Meek's career.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Meek+Mill"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

90,90,sheck wes,735199,9884219,"Harlem and Milwaukee raised Senegalese rapper Sheck Wes' popularity started in the late 2010's, despite debuting almost a decade earlier. 

His debut single ""Live Sheck Wes"", released in 2016, found some moderate success on the streaming app SoundCloud.

He was later signed to a joint deal in 2018 with Kanye West's ""G.O.O.D. Music"" and Travis Scott's ""Cactus Jack"" label, and his debut project, ""MUDBOY"" was released on October 5th of that same year.

Despite not being a single, Travis Scott's ""ASTROWORLD"" album track alongside Juice WRLD and Sheck Wes titled ""No Bystanders"" charted in some countries, including the USA, where at #31 it was Wes' first entry in the country.

Following the track's mild success, the song ""Mo Bamba"", off his aforementioned debut album and inspired by his friendship with the basketball player of the same name, became a smash hit over a year after its release, reaching the top positions of charts all around the world, including a #5 in Canada and a #6 in the USA.

Part of the single's popularity was due to an Internet meme were Know-it-all, a character from the animated 2004 film ""Polar Express"", was supposedly asking a group of people if they wanted to hear the above-mentioned hit single by Sheck Wes or label mate Travis Scott's track ""SICKO MODE"".

91,91,gucci mane,2399227,50610363,"Radric Davis (born February 12, 1980 in Birmingham, Alabama), better known by his stage name Gucci Mane, is an American rapper and CEO of 1017 Brick Squad Records. In 2005 he released his independent debut album, Trap House, which featured the successful single ""Icy"" that he recorded with Young Jeezy. He has since released a further three albums including 2006's Hard To Kill, 2007's Trap-A-Thon and 2007's Back To The Trap House. His sixth studio album, The State vs Radric Davis, was released in December 2009, just weeks after he was sent back to prison for 12 months for violating his probation. He was released in May 2010 and will now release his seventh studio album, The Appeal: Georgia's Most Wanted, sometime at the end of 2010.

It’s said that art mirrors life. In hip-hop’s case, there’s always been a deliberate entanglement of perception and reality. Fans demand their MCs be real…but never too real. Successful hip-hop is about the hint of the danger, the tease of it, the mystique. Hip-hop is about balance.

Gucci Mane is an artist striving for that balance, volatility versus musicality. Controversy, including a feud with former collaborator Young Jeezy, has grabbed the headlines, with insufficient regard paid to his considerable mic skills, raw talent, and business acumen. Gucci is looking to wrest his name from public speculation and let his own words do the talking.

“I wish everybody well who’s making money in this rap game,” the Atlanta-raised rapper says, dismissing the controversy that followed him in the past. “My own rap game is going so good, I’ve got so many things on my plate at my label, that I don’t got time for other people’s business.” With a deal with Asylum Records as the boss of his own label, So Icey Entertainment, Gucci does indeed have a full schedule with no time to dwell on the past.

“I live my life with no regrets. I just wish that a lot of things never happened, but anybody can wish,” says Gucci. Sounds like a man with his eyes on the prize. And you’d expect nothing less from an artist who ground his way to the top via the hustle of independent records. Signing to Big Cat Records in the wake of his local single “Black Tee,” he dropped his debut record, Trap House, in May 2005. The independent album moved an impressive 140,000 units, largely on the strength of the “Icy” single, featuring Jeezy. Clamor over song rights sparked dispute, and the resulting rift grew.

Controversy notwithstanding, Mane’s independence was cemented: “I was on the independent scene for about two years,” he recalls. “It’s crazy! You gotta go into your own pocket to support your craft. You need other avenues to have money coming in, to support your stuff. You might win, you might lose, and it’s a gamble out there with the independent circuit. One thing you’d better have is good music because without that, you go downhill fast in the independent game.”

Good music firmly in hand, Gucci was fast approaching stardom when more tragedy befell him. But let’s backtrack; how did the man born Radric Davis in Bessemer, Alabama, become Gucci Mane, mouthpiece for Atlanta stuntin’? Mane remembers little from his time in Alabama, just that it was rural, and that it’s changed dramatically since he left at the age of nine. “I gotta shout out Alabama though, because they holdin’ it down,” he affirms. “Every time I go there to do a show, I’m impressed with how hip-hop culture has taken root.”

Mane’s identity coalesced when he moved with his mother to Atlanta. “I lived all of my adolescent and adult life in Atlanta,” he explains. “I’m from East Atlanta Zone Six; it was hard, man, it was real rough. I grew up in the Starter jacket era: they’d take your Starter jacket, your 8Ball jacket, they’d take your hat, your shoes. It was just no holds barred on the streets, dog eat dog. If you missed the bus, you had to be crewed up or you’d get jumped. It was wild when I came up.”

It’s a bleak portrait. When asked to describe his home life more vividly, Mane offers a look into his contemplative side, a side honed as a schoolyard poet. “I was just a young dude in a single parent house most of my life. I can’t complain that much. I would guess it’s like any black child growing up in a single parent household. There are a lot of people who know how that is. I didn’t have a lot coming up; but what I did have, I appreciated. I was blessed to have a caring mother to raise me right and to help me with my business ventures; she’s been there through the whole struggle. There’s a lot that goes along with that; it made me who I am today.”

A stepfather would enter the picture during Mane’s adolescence, introducing not only a male figure, but also inspiration for Mane’s unusual moniker. “My father came in, the original Gucci Mane; that’s what people in the neighborhood called him, and that’s where I get my name from. From then on, I grew up the son of a hustler and a schoolteacher; it was the best of both worlds because I was educated twice.” Drawing inspiration from a pantheon of rappers before him –Big Daddy Kane, LL Cool J, Ice Cube, the Beastie Boys, N.W.A—Mane went on to release Trap House, a lethal brew of his signature sound: “I call my music straight Gucci: going hard and whatever beats you make you for me, if I’m feeling it, if I’m rocking with it, I’m gonna crush it. When you hear me, you hear a lot of pain, a lot of hood; you hear what’s going on in the inner city in Atlanta.”

Unfortunately, Trap House was ill timed; the month of its release, Gucci was accused of murder and jailed for two days. Eventually deemed to be acting in self-defense, and without sufficient evidence to hold him, Mane was exonerated. But the ordeal left an indelible imprint on the man. “I learned to keep better company, watch where I go, and be mindful of my surroundings at all times,” he reveals. “Watch what I say, watch what I do and how I do it, just keep myself out of the wrong crowd.”

“I always stand up man,” he continues. “I’m one of the toughest guys I know. It’ll take a lot more than that to break me down.” Undeterred, Mane was back in the studio, preparing 2006’s eerily apropos Hard To Kill. The buzz from Hard To Kill vaulted Gucci Mane from regional commodity to national treasure, and major labels responded accordingly: “There was a bidding war going on, and I liked Atlantic’s approach. They made it known that they wanted me, they felt where I was going and that I could grow with them.”

Asylum/Atlantic Records welcomed Gucci Mane in early ’07, granting him his own imprint, So Icey Entertainment. With it comes an entire stable of artists, the So Icey Boyz. As the Boyz ready for their own exposure –“I got them in training; they be in the weight room, pumping iron, doing pushups, shopping at the mall, buying ice”—Gucci is focused on his magnum opus, Back to the Trap House. “I started working on the album, and by the third song, I was like ‘This is going back to the Trap House.’ I started feeling the same way I did when I made my first album. It had the same feel to it, the same freshness. And I had the same hunger and desire I had when I first started rapping.”

“Since I went major, I want everybody to know I’m still keeping it street, keeping it hood,” Gucci maintains. “I’m trying to take it back to all my fans that I had when I first started my career. And at the same time, I’m trying to open up my new album to a new fan base. So it’s a mix for everybody coming together, like my first album was.” Gucci has always prided himself on his innate ability, and his refusal to let guest appearances dictate the tone of his records. “I just want people to know I’m a great songwriter, man,” he asserts. “I’m passionate about what I do, and it’s choreographed strategically when I do it. I bring a lot of experience, creative wordplay, and a crazy style. And my albums, I record most of the songs without writing them down; it’s a God-given gift and I just get paid for it. It come from God, it’s like wondering what makes a bird fly. He made me a poet like the great poets of the past.”

But don’t mistake Gucci’s confidence for self-absorption. The vicissitudes of his career have dictated a longer view. Lyrics aside, he’s less preoccupied with visible means and more so with acting as an emissary from his under-repped block. “I’m not the one to glorify what goes on in the hood,” he insists. “We have everything there, the whole range from violence to people getting on the bus and going to work. There’s a lot more to the hood than just drugs. It’s a bigger story, there’s a big picture. I went to school in that neighborhood, I worked there, I trapped there, I hustled there, and I got my name there. I’m proud to be from East Atlanta Zone Six, and I claim there. I hold that on my back and carry that, to be the first one from there to really rock.”

And Gucci’s professional aims have matured as well. While other rappers stress platinum plaques, Gucci hasn’t forgotten the route he took to stardom. “I made a lot of CDs on my own. People fucked with me and supported me, and just made me the man I am today. That’s my blueprint right there, and I stay mindful of it. So now, my only concern is that people feel my music; at the end of the day, I do it for people to feel it. If one person feel it, two people feel it, I feel like my job’s been done.”

Fortunately for Gucci, he should be prepared to welcome an army of new fans with Back to the Trap House. But longstanding fans shouldn’t fear; they’ll recognize “Freaky Gurl,” reprised from its previous appearance from Hard To Kill. Luda, upon hearing the joint, asked for a guest spot on the remix. Said remix now appears as the lead single on Back to the Trap House, following in Gucci’s theme of mating old and new. Over a bouncing, meandering beat from Cyber Sapp, the two cook up the requisite concoction of whips, chips, and chicks. Also look out for “Bird Flu,” the album’s number two single, laced by New-York based Supa Sonics. Elsewhere, firm guest verses from Rich Boy and Pimp C of UGK round out Gucci’s regional flavor, while Bay-area producer Zaytoven (of “Icy” renown) locks down Gucci’s West Coast appeal.

Gucci Mane has something for everyone, and with the struggles of the past in his rearview, Gucci is settled in for his ride to the top. “I’m best known for controversy but I’m trying to gain respect as a songwriter and entertainer. I plan to hit them so hard with this album; who knows what the future will bring. I’ll be banging them out till I can’t bang no more.”

92,92,sherine,142865,2706655,"Sherine Abdul Wahhab, (Arabic: شيرين عبد الوهاب, also credited as Sherine Ahmed) is an Egyptian singer, born October 10, 1980 in Cairo. She is popularly known simply as Sherine شيرين (AKA Shereen, Sherin). She started her musical career with her successful debut single, ""Ah Ya Leil"".

Born in Cairo, Sherine is a graduate of a prominent Egyptian music academy. Upon graduating, she sought a record company to represent her and manage her musical career. She met up with Free Music Productions' owner and manager Nasr Mahrous. Mahrous signed and released a debut album with fellow singer Tamer Hosny. The album included solo singles, as well as duets. Titled Free Mix 3, it is one of the mix-tapes Mahrous usually produces but was exclusively for these two artists. Although Sherine was a new artist with Free Music, Tamer had signed with Mahrous earlier.

The album included Sherine's debut single, ""Ah Ya Leil"", which garnered huge success in Egypt and throughout the Middle East. Critics and audience were impressed with Sherine's vocal abilities, but wanted her to revamp her image. The song included local musical styles from traditional Egyptian tarab voice techniques to usage of traditional Egyptian music instruments common to the Shaabi genre. Hosny's single, along with the music video, were also received very well and this mixtape was considered a milestone in Free Music's short history.

in 2002, Sherine released her first album as a solo artist titled Garh Tany. The album's first single was the title track, ""Garh Tany"", and it was well-received. The single consisted mainly of repetition, with intensive manipulation in voice tones and pitch. This is also considered to be a traditional Egyptian voice technique. The music video was released one week earlier from the album release, and the album made huge success in the Egyptian and wider Middle Eastern music market. By North American standards, the album would be the equivalent of certified platinum.

Sherine's second single from the album was ""Sabri Aleel"", which was an uptempo song, uses slight traditional techniques, but included Nai, Tabla, Heavy Bass and multi-layered voices of Sherine in the choruses. The music video's version of the song was different from the album's, and it was titled ""Sabri Aleel - Melody Mix"". The song was exclusively broadcast on Melody Hits channel.

Sherine's acting career is short, as she just starred in one comedy movie titled Medo Mashakel. In the movie, Sherine sings and one of the singles sung in the movie was broadcasted on music channels. The song was titled ""Balak"". It portrays Sherine, as one of the movie's scenes, getting on stage in a friend's wedding and performing the song. The song didn't get as much attention, as it wasn't released on any record.

A compilation album for Sherine was released under the title Roo'. The album included the movie-song ""Balak"", along with few other songs of her such as ""Afriqiya"" and other songs of Tamer Hosny. The album was considered unofficial, as it wasn't released under Free Music label since Sherine was still signed with the company.

By this time, and before releasing the single ""Ma Btefrahsh"", it was reported in magazines and tabloid-newspapers that Sherine was having a fall-out with Nasr Mahrous, but it was not confirmed. Sherine was on hiatus during that time, as she didn't release any singles nor albums for quite a while, and according to some sources, Sherine was mad at her producer and manager, Nasr Mahrous, for not fulfilling the terms of agreement in their contract.

In early 2005, Promotions for Sherine's new song, ""Ma Btefrahsh"" showed up on Melody Hits, and a week later the music video was released. The song became quite popular, and it was heavily rotated on Melody Hits. The song was almost like a comeback to Sherine. It was featured in a mixtape along other singles by fellow Free Music artists, such as Bahaa Sultan, Soma and Tamer Hosny. The mixtape featured another single by Sherine, ""Einak"". Both songs were frequently aired on Radio channels.

In August 2005, Sherine's new single was also promoted on Melody Hits TV, and it seemed certain that this was going to be one of the album releases as she had said earlier in TV interviews. The promotion shows a camera following Sherine's bare feet walking, up to a chair where she sits, but it doesn't show her face. Another promo had a sample from her second single ""Mafeesh Marra"".

More than a week later, the single, titled ""Lazim Aïsh"" was released. It was also produced and directed by Nasr Mahrous, the song took a different form as it was a ballad. This was the title track as well. The album, Lazim Aïsh, was released. The album also would be certified platinum as it was wildly successful. It was the best selling album in the Arab World in 2005.

94,94,armin van buuren,1607100,55885171,"Armin van Buuren (born Armin Jozef Jacobus Daniël van Buuren, December 25, 1976) is a trance (mostly progressive trance and uplifting trance) music producer and DJ from the Netherlands. His musical career started in 1995.

He has been named number one in the prestigious DJ MAG Top 100 poll four times in a row, from 2007 till 2010 and for the 5th time in 2012. He's the first DJ in the history of the DJ Magazine to achieve that and an indication of his prolific output over more than 14 years he’s been dj’ing and producing. Being the official World’s Most Popular DJ is just one of his many achievements, but the driving force behind his success is an overriding passion for electronic dance music.

2008 began with the success that the number one DJ seems to attract; he was awarded with the prestigious Buma Cultuur Pop Award in January. This was followed by being voted as the Best Trance Artist in the Beatport Music Awards in March; judged on the musician’s artistic achievements, national and international success, it is evident that Armin van Buuren has become one of the decade’s most influential trance acts.

Even a basic list of recent successes reads like a lifetime of work: ‘Best Album’ for artist album ‘Shivers’ at both the Dutch Release Dance Awards and the prestigious Edison Awards; ‘Best Compilation’ for ‘A State Of Trance’, in 2006, claiming the ‘Best European DJ’ award in 2007 and ‘Best Mix Radio Show’ at the Miami Winter Music Conference in 2006 and 2007, for radio show ‘A State Of Trance’ – now broadcasting on a massive 40 FM stations as well as satellite and internet radio, with over 26 million listeners a week; a 5th year residency in Ibiza at Amnesia and over 50,000 downloads every week from podcasting high end chart-bothering positions all over the world for singles, albums and compilations , with single “Rush Hour” used as the theme tune to the UEFA European Youth Championship; the #1 entry in the Dutch album charts with his artist album ‘Imagine’, the #1 entry of the DVD registration of ‘Armin Only ‘ Imagine’ – the landmarks just keep coming!

The 350th episode and the 7th year of the hit radio show ‘A State of Trance’ was celebrated in May 2008 with an eight hour live broadcast from Antwerp in Belgium to over 40 radio stations internationally. Fans were invited to a free party with a line up that had been voted for by the show’s listeners; another example of the importance the DJ places on the satisfaction of his fans. Considering the popularity of the radio show the introduction of ‘A State of Trance Podcast’ was a natural progression. The weekly podcasts which contain highlights and Armin’s favourite tracks from the previous episode ensure that trance lovers across the world will never miss another episode!
Sold-out shows for Armin Only in 2005 and 2006 created eager anticipation of the third edition, which kicked off in a sold-out Jaarbeurs in Utrecht in 2008; over 16,000 fans attended and were enthralled by the DJ’s nine hour set. The theme of the night was ‘Imagine’, described by Armin as “the celebration of our sensations both in life and in clubland.” Fans all around the world should not despair, as ‘Armin Only’ tour dates have also been set for Romania, Poland, Belgium and Australia; the DJ will also be touring in England, Scotland, Ibiza, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, and the USA, with expected dates in, for an example, the Czech Republic.

Born in Leiden, Holland (on December 25, 1976) to a musical family, Armin indulged his passion for music from a young age. He spent all the money he earned with his paper round on records. His mum won a computer when he was 10, gaining Armin’s interest. “So as a little nerdy kid I was writing my own basic programmes, and learnt about the technology from there.” He progressed from making low-profile mix tapes for friends to higher profile mixes when he discovered experimenting with different sequences on his computer through his uncle. “I was so stunned by what I saw him doing on the computer, that I got addicted to creating music right there and then!”
“I loved dance music immediately – this great rebellious sound that was so different to the ‘beautiful’ songs of the years before”. Armin cites electronic pioneer Jean Michel Jarre as a major influence (famed for his awesome visuals as well as his groundbreaking synth sounds), as well as Dutch producer Ben Liebrand, who later mentored him in his mixing and producing.
In the early days, Armin thought it was wise to have something extra in case the DJ’ing didn’t work out. So he studied for a law degree. The final year of his course was inevitably stretched as he juggled his studies with his increasingly hectic schedule; his rise to fame included lots of productions and remixes, as well as playing out to packed clubs every weekend. It took him three years to graduate, but his determination made him succeed!

Armin’s own productions have all made a huge impact and quickly gain worldwide acclaim; his latest artist album titled ‘Imagine’ entered the Dutch Album Top 100 Chart at number one; this is the first time a dance producer has ever accomplished such a feat in the history of Dutch music. The first single to be taken from this album, ‘Going Wrong’ with DJ Shah featuring Chris Jones, entered the Dutch Singles Chart at number five. The ‘Armin Only DVD’ was also released and reached the acclaimed number one spot in its second week. His back catalogue includes Blue Fear, Communication, Sound of Goodbye, Shivers, Rush Hour, Burned With Desire, Exhale, Love You More, This World Is Watching Me, and Yet Another Day. While the remix offers flood in, Armin only takes on tracks that he really loves. He uses exactly the same criteria for his compilations, meaning that every release from Armin or his long-running Armind label is a bone fide stormer that’s earned its place. His output includes tracks for the cult TV series 24, and the likes of Motorcycle’s As The Rush Comes.
Armin is a dedicated trance lover, but isn’t imprisoned by a single genre, saying “What makes trance work so well is that it doesn’t stick to one style, and can incorporate electro, minimal, whatever it likes.” His desire to showcase more of the great music he hears, along with the number of people sending him tracks they wanted to release, led to the obvious step of starting his own label, Armada, in 2003.

The label is a joint venture between Armin, Maykel Piron (former head of A&R for Warner Music) and David Lewis, who'd previously managed Armin. ""What we wanted was a company that could offer everything for an artist: representation, a booking agency, and a record company. Artists can choose full management, or to just release a record or play out at gigs. Armada lets the artists choose what they want without telling them what to do"".
Armin is now a fully-fledged artist in his own right, having made his songwriting debut on his album, the award-winning Shivers; The events continue to get bigger and bigger, and Armin regularly headlines the likes of Sensation White, Global Gathering, Dance Valley, ZoukOut, Mysteryland, Coachella, Beats In Brazil, Trance Energy, Fort Dance, Summer Days – basically whether you’re in Australia, Russia, the Middle East, the US or Europe, you can catch Armin van Buuren at a club or festival near you!
""This is just what I really want,"" says Armin. ""It’s not just love for music, it’s my passion. It goes beyond liking, and beyond a hobby, it’s about a way of living. Music is essential to my life”.

96,96,tom misch,681498,17816974,"“Apparently, I have a sound , and people can hear it,” Tom Misch claims modestly. For someone with a cohesive and sprawling body of mellow beats behind him, he seems mildly bewildered that this is the case. “I try so many genres that it’s hard sometimes to pinpoint. I guess my sound is uplifting, soulful, funky — and happy more than it is sad.” It’s a perfect description of his debut album, due in 2018, which brings together low-slung hip-hop beats, glittering disco, and noodling jazz instrumentation in a way only Misch can.

If Misch seems surprised, it’s because his fanbase has developed naturally. He never set out with any grand plan when he began making beats, and uploading roughly three tracks a week to Soundcloud at 16. “ I prefer a more organic approach to making music, but also to building a fanbase,” he reflects. “I don’t want a big push on my music as I don’t want to be as big as possible.” And yet, he’s rapidly become one of the U.K.’s most exciting emerging new artists, gaining 1.1 million monthly listeners on Spotify and playing a sold-out tour of the U.K., U.S. and Europe in 2016. Collaborating with a clutch of fellow trailblazers like Novelist, Loyle Carner, and Zak Abel, he’s accumulated a total of 75 million streams across all platforms to date — and it all started in his bedroom.

Misch’s earliest introduction to music came via his artistic family, including his psychiatrist father, a passionate violinist, who would take him to concerts and the opera as a child. He sang in a choir at school, and picked up the violin himself at the age of four. When one of his older sisters took up guitar and later abandoned it, nine-year-old Misch inherited the instrument, and taught himself to play Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Nirvana songs. Today, he also plays bass, banjo, and a smattering of keys.

It was one of his sister’s boyfriends who introduced him to the music of J Dilla at 15, and from then on, Misch was hooked. He took up Music Technology at school the following year, and began learning how to create his own “really chilled out, boom-bap kind of ‘90s hip-hop” on Logic Pro. “When I wasn’t at school, I’d be making beats,” he says. “It was just what I did.” As he began sharing his tunes on Soundcloud, he found the response was overwhelming. “You put songs out and you build a fanbase — it’s kind of addictive.”

A collaboration with his sister Laura, on the jazz-inflected “Follow,” was a major turning point for both siblings after it was uploaded to influencer YouTube channel Majestic Casual. The track features Laura on sax and Tom on beats and vocals, intertwined to mesmeric effect. “That was the point where I was like, okay, maybe I could do this as a career,” Misch reflects. “Suddenly it had 100,000 plays.” Shortly afterward, Soulection co-founder Joe Kay commented on one of Misch’s productions on Soundcloud, asking the teenage prodigy to guest on his radio show.

Soon afterward, in 2014, Misch contributed to Soulection’s White Label series, weaving together obscure jazz samples, guitar, and vocals to create the perfect summer listen (including the dreamy fan favourite “The Journey”). His Beat Tape series collected the best of his hip-hop instrumentals, the 5 Day Mischon project featured collaborations with grime MC Novelist and singer-songwriter Zak Abel, and his 2016 Reverie EP brought the official release of Misch’s most sophisticated songs to date. As well as soulful singers Carmody and Jordan Rakei, he struck up a collaborative relationship with fellow south Londoner Loyle Carner, whose mellow bars flow over Misch’s productions like a breeze on a hot day. Both artists form part of the much-hyped scene of singer-songwriters emerging from south east London, including King Krule and Cosmo Pyke. Each has a DIY mindset and a brooding, poetic approach to lyricism that weaves them loosely together. “There’s definitely a certain sound,” reflects Misch. “Everyone’s music in south London is really chilled. It reflects the vibe of this part of London — it’s laid back.”

Misch has lived in south London all his life, and he loves it so much that his new single, “South of the River,” is dedicated to it. “I much prefer the general vibe of south London,” he says. “I love this area, Peckham, Dulwich, Forest Hill. Singing that line — You should come south of the river — it just felt really good.” With its string arrangements mirroring disco synth stabs and a funky bassline, it’s an irresistible bop that nods clearly to Misch’s danceable new direction.

One of the biggest influences on Misch’s sound has long been jazz. With a degree in jazz guitar, Misch is an avid listener of Robert Glasper, Roy Hargrove, Cory Henry, and jazz-influenced songwriters like D’Angelo and Erykah Badu. “It’s kind of a warm feeling, when you hear a certain chord progression,” he explains.

In the making of his debut album, he’s also been drawing on inspiration from disco, house, and techno, discovered through the portal of producers like Kaytranada and Motor City Drum Ensemble. The euphoric feel of 1970s and ‘80s disco (think Earth Wind and Fire or Gwen McCrae), and the thump of nightclubs like Fabric or Corsica, inspired him to bring more movement into his songs. “I want people to dance at my live shows, I want to bring more energy,” he says. “When you’re in a club and you can feel the bass...I want people to have that experience.”

Misch’s sound is true to its roots — he still makes his tracks in the same bedroom studio in his parents’ house, and his mum produces his artwork. (“ Her work is very DIY, just like my music, and feels homespun,” he explains.) But he’s never afraid to explore new territory. “I think it’s really important to make music that hasn’t been made before,” he says. “I’m trying to work out what my sound is, and pursuing that.” Fans might think they know his style, but Misch is a restless experimentalist, keen to spend endless hours honing his craft. One of his favorite new songs is a “Brazilian-sounding” jam that reflects how deeply he feels about his work. As he puts it: “It’s about how you can’t take away my love for music. I’ll always have that.” <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Misch"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

97,97,kina grannis,524897,6061950,"Kina Kasuya Grannis (born August 4, 1985, of Japanese, English, Irish, French, and German descent) is a Japanese-American guitarist and singer-songwriter from Orange County, CA. She started performing in 2001 after getting over her shyness. Kina independently released her first full-length album, Stairwells, on February 23, 2010. Her music is both sweet and melancholy, but always filled with hope. 

Kina started playing shows at the age of four in front of her stuffed animals. Now she plays in front of people, though it wasn’t the quickest transition for the admittedly shy songstress. While attending college at USC, Kina often retreated to the secluded stairwells around campus where she could write and sing without being heard. Protected by their quiet confines, she found a safe haven and a creative outlet for her music. Armed with a guitar and a cup of tea, Kina wrote in every stairwell she came across. And it was within these stairwells that she developed her confidence as a songwriter and her poise as a performer.

In 2007, Kina joined YouTube, made a music video and entered herself into a contest. A few months later, her video for “Message From Your Heart” aired during the Superbowl and its 97 million viewers (or 194 million eyeballs, depending on how you’re keeping track) and she walked away with a record deal. Since then, Kina has regularly posted her songs on YouTube, amassing many millions of views, and toured throughout North America. Her songs have been heard on television shows such as ABC’s General Hospital and MTV’s College Life. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kina+Grannis"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In October 2018, Quavo stated that Culture III would be released in early 2019. The album was then delayed and re-scheduled for release in early 2020. However, the album was pushed back again, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Quavo spoke to Billboard in March 2020, and announced the group's decision to hold off on the release of Culture III, explaining it was largely due to their inability to properly roll out the album once social distancing rules went into effect in most states in the US. Instead, the group will first release Quarantine Mixtape in the lead-up to Culture III. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Migos"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Angèle Van Laeken is the daughter of the singer Marka and of the actress Laurence Bibot. She was born in Uccle, Brussels-Capital Region. Her father encouraged her from an early age to learn the piano, which inspired her musical career. Angèle spent a difficult adolescence in a strict Catholic school before attending the Decroly School. The artistic options at this high school helped develop her musical skills.

Angèle gave her first performances in cafés around Brussels. She was first noticed for her cover of Dick Annegarn, ""Bruxelles"", and on Instagram videos where she mixed singing and comedy. In 2017, she was the support act for Ibeyi and the Belgian rapper Damso, whom she also accompanied in his album Lithopédion. Her first single, ""La Loi de Murphy"", was released in late 2017 and received millions of views on YouTube. A second single ""Je veux tes yeux"" was released in early 2018. The two video clips were directed by the Belgian photographer Charlotte Abramow.

Angèle is a fan of Ella Fitzgerald and Hélène Ségara. She is inspired by many musical genres from French songs to electronic music and rap, which she disliked as a teenager. She became influenced by rap particularly while performing with her brother Romeo Elvis and the rappers Caballero and JeanJass. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ang%C3%A8le"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A string of singles and an EP for the Nettwerk label paved the way for his 2019 full-length debut, Ode to a Friend.

After several years playing in bands around the Atlanta area, Cramer decided to forge ahead as a solo act, adopting the Old Sea Brigade name in 2015. Self-released in 2016, his eponymous debut EP earned him enough buzz to land key support slots for Hiss Golden Messenger, Julien Baker, and Benjamin Francis Leftwich during his first U.S. tour. Later that year, he inked a deal with Nettwerk and began work on a follow-up release. Cramer's first single for Nettwerk, the rousing ""All the Same,"" dropped in September 2016 and was later included on 2017's Wash Me Away, the first of three EPs he would issue that year. The song ""Tidal Wave,"" from his next EP, Cover My Own, notched significant play on streaming networks. Cramer closed out a banner year with the Christmas EP Songs for the Holidays.

A former member of the rock band Stomp on Melvin, Stirling began releasing videos on Youtube in 2007 and in 2010 competed on ""America's Got Talent"". Her appearance on ""America's Got Talent"" gained the attention of cinematographer Devin Graham, with whom she has collaborated on several videos since 2010. Her YouTube channel has become extremely popular and has received upwards of 100 million views.

Stirling was born in Santa Ana, California, but spent a portion of her childhood in Gilbert, Arizona and graduated from Mesquite High School.

Stirling returned home to Provo in 2009 to continue studying at BYU. She resided there until December 2012, when she moved back to Arizona with her family. Currently she lives in Los Angeles, California.

At the age of five, after being influenced by the classical music records played by her father, Stirling began to study the violin. She took private lessons for twelve years. When she was sixteen, she joined a rock band in Mesquite High School with four friends called ""Stomp on Melvin"". As part of her experience with Stomp on Melvin, Stirling wrote a solo violin rock song, and her performance helped her to win the state title of Arizona's Junior Miss and claim the Spirit Award in the America's Junior Miss Finals competition.

On its released in USA the album reached the second position on Billboard 200, making Stirling's biggest sales week of her career. The album peaked on four different Billboard music charts.

Lleshaj, an Albanian originally from Kosovo, whose family fled to Sweden while she was a child to escape war and conflict in the region, was living in Stockholm when she met Randall, from Minneapolis, on SoundCloud in 2012. Lleshaj began commenting on the tracks Randall had posted and the two discovered they appreciated each other's music. After meeting in person in Minneapolis, they began working together in Sweden as Flora Cash. The duo has said that they've never revealed the origin or meaning of their band name to anyone.

Pall and Taggart first made a name for themselves by creating remixes of their favorite indie bands that garnered tens of millions of streams. The duo released its official debut single, ""#Selfie,"" which celebrated and skewered 2010s narcissism, in January 2014. The track's bouncy beats and self-obsessed words hit number one on the Billboard dance chart and sold over ten million copies. Meanwhile, ""#Selfie""'s video featured cameos by Snoop Dogg and David Hasselhoff, fueling the song's viral popularity to hundreds of millions of views. More singles, including ""Kanye"" and ""Let You Go,"" followed.

In 2015, they issued the Bouquet EP on Disruptor Records, a softer and more indie-flavored effort that featured the single ""Roses,"" which was certified double-platinum and hit number one on the Top Dance Songs chart. The song also earned the Chainsmokers nominations for the Billboard Music Awards in the Top Dance/Electronic Artist and Top Dance/Electronic Song categories. After playing over 300 shows in 2015, including dates at festivals like Lollapalooza, Firefly, Tomorrowland, and Ultra, the duo returned in 2016 with the platinum-certified ""Don't Let Me Down,"" a collaboration with Pittsburgh pop singer Daya that topped the Billboard dance chart and would later win a Grammy. That year, the Chainsmokers also performed as part of the Tilt Tour, the first ever fan-sourced tour. In addition, Pall and Taggart host two SiriusXM shows: Nice Hair, a monthly mix; and the weekly YouTube EDM 15.

122,122,vansire,1436274,31245916,"Vansire is a dream pop band from Rochester, Minnesota consisting of Josh Augustin and Sam Winemiller. They are currently signed to Spirit Goth Records. Vansire has performed at ROCKChester and First Avenue, played a live session with Audiotree, and collaborated with artists such as Chester Watson, Jeremiah Jae, and Mick Jenkins.

Vansire formed as band members Josh Augustin (vocals, synths, guitar, and drums) and Sam Winemiller (bass, guitar, and synths) were attending Century High School in Rochester, Minnesota. Augustin and Winemiller met while playing together on the school's drumline and continued to find themselves performing together through school activities (such as concert band and pit orchestra), something the duo says contributed to their creative synergy and friendship, which later helped in Vansire's formation.

In the summer of 2015, Winemiller approached Augustin after practice for the school's drumline with an idea to make a band ""that sounds like Mac [DeMarco]"". The pair's early recordings were made by holding instruments to the internal microphone of an iPad running GarageBand. Augustin and Winemiller, initially unsure of what to call their new project, turned to an online random word generator that landed on ""vansire"", an alternative name for the Marsh mongoose. From there, the two continued to record together in their basements, living rooms, and bedrooms under the new Vansire moniker.

In August 2016, Vansire self-released their first album, ""Reflections and Reveries"". The duo recorded the album entirely in Winemiller's basement in a roughly one-year period from August 2015 to August 2016, and included Winemiller's brother, Issac, on bass for some songs.

During this time, Augustin began studying at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and Oberlin College, while Winemiller started at the University of Minnesota. Despite the distance, the duo vowed to remain committed to the Vansire project, now describing it as ""a long-distance band relationship.""

Vansire released their second album Angel Youth in April 2018 on Spirit Goth Records. Augustin and Winemiller produced and mastered the album themselves, and it is the band's first full-length album that featured collaborations with other artists.

In June 2019, the duo released their single ""Metamodernity"", also recording an Audiotree Live session at Audiotree's studios in Chicago later that August.

In July 2020, Vansire released ""Central Time"", a single featuring Chicago-based rapper Mick Jenkins in their first collaboration together. In an interview announcing the single, Augustin said the single began as an instrumental demo that Winemiller sent him in September 2019, which sat untouched for roughly eight months until the duo returned back to it, finishing it up at the beginning of June 2020.

During this period of the band's history, Augustin said that Vansire found itself leaning in an ""increasingly dance-oriented direction"" with regard to musical sound and that the duo has started to draw influence from more ""dancey, funk-imbued music"".

On October 16, 2020, Vansire released ""After Fillmore County"", a seven-song EP that brought back FLOOR CRY, and featured Philadelphia-based rapper Ivy Sole. In April 2021, Vansire released a remix of Sydney-based producer-artist Swaine Delgado's ""F Me Up"", their first remix.

124,124,exo,832875,136435045,"There are several artists or groups with this name:

1. EXO (Korean: 엑소) is a Chinese-South Korean boy band based in Seoul. Formed by S.M. Entertainment in 2011, the group consists of twelve members separated into two subgroups, EXO-K and EXO-M, performing music in Korean and Mandarin, respectively. EXO rose to fame with the release of their best-selling first album XOXO (2013), which contained the breakthrough hit ""으르렁 (Growl)"". XOXO was a critical and commercial success, winning both Disk Daesang at the 28th Golden Disk Awards and Album of the Year at the 15th Mnet Asian Music Awards. It eventually went to sell over one million copies, putting EXO as the fastest-selling Korean artist in twelve years. Their EP Overdose (2014) made EXO the highest-charting Korean male act on the Billboard 200.

2. The polish underground rapper is known for his relaxing, jazzy style and humorous lyrics. ""Exotyka"" is his  second album released on 16 Wersow an independent, warsaw-based label. First one was called ""Masaz Glowy"".

3. The modern rock band from Chicago, USA was formed in the late 90s, and toured with several notable acts (including Trapt) before disbanding in 2006 at the death of one of the members.

4. The french-speaking christian band, founded in 1989 when the South-African Chris Christensen and his American wife Laura met the Swiss Thierry Ostrini. They have written several worship songs sung in french-speaking churches. Their first album (recorded in Brussels) was released in 1995. A specific profile has been created at EXO Groupe. Please update your music library tags.

5. A Russian Metal Band from Saint-Petersburg 

6. Helsinki based three-piece EXO play a hybrid of riff based doom, post hardcore and pseudoscientific space rock, the last being a non-audible element. EXO strips off all of rock music's unnecessary elements, thus displaying the steady foundation of bass and drums. Their trademark sound is economic yet massive.

7. Behind the codename EXo (mind the capital X) we find Gheorghi Penkov -a person known for his numerous activities, both in art and science. 27 years old, he already has a definite musical experience -as a DJ, producer, promoter, music journalist and beatbox/darbuka performer. Jorro, as his friends call him, is open to every genre as long as it brings experiment and new ideas. EXo’s interest in music production and mixing dates back to 1995 when he initially got interested in interactive multimedia demos. Together with friend Martin Hristov, Gheorghi starts the demo group Ancient Media, that in consequently released the two demos – Idleness (’96) and Water Illusions (‘97). Demos are highly technological short video productions (10 mins) that render audio and video in realtime. This early interest in multimedia triggers EXo’s passion for electronic music. Between 19982001 he produces ambient and downtemp tracks under the SentagriS moniker. Unfortunately most of these never get released, since in 90s there is no label or company interested in such sound in Bulgaria,... net-labels are yet to come. Years later, two of these tracks are included in the digital releases Wamoxyn (2003, Z-dimension) and Acnod Tucmod Tipo (2007, Contone Records). With his typical perfectionism and endless energy, EXo continues his search for new sound experimenting with electronics, beat-boxing and darbuka/djembe drums. Soon after he finds the drum and bass that and it takes over his focus. EXo joins H.M.S.U. by appointment with Dimitar “Targy” Dimitrov, and is with the organization since it’s very first days. By that time he's a junior drum and bass DJ, one that in the course of time gets totally devoted to the classic drum and bass (it's what we nowadays call oldskool). After H.M.S.U’s third openair festival EXo’s focus starts to slowly shift towards jungle, and eventually dub music. During his sporadic 2003-2005 appearances on H.M.S.U. events he selects mostly roots and tech dub. Then suddenly, in 2005, he finds a new sound that fundamentally changes his view on bass music, and puts his musical roaming to an end. In 2006, EXo becomes the first DJ to pioneer the fresh dubstep genre in Bulgaria -the audience is schoked, yet fascinated by the unexpected beat. But that’s enough of a reason  for dubstep to become EXo’s primary focus in the years to come. Consequently he proves himself as the leading dubstep DJ in the country – always with up to date selection of uncompromised sound quality. Up to date EXo has presented dubstep on more than 50 venues, and for the listening pleasure of Bulgarian, Romanian and Greek audiences. He has performed on one stage with artists like Luke Envoy and Mary Anne Hobbs /BBC Radio1/. In 2007, on two big venues, HMSU’s Summer Open-air Festival 2007 and at Drum and Jazz 2007, EXo presented his experimental live dupstep project together with popoular drummer Victor Alexandrov. Nowdays, EXo is also responsible for the logistics and coordination of number of H.M.S.U. activities. He and Martin Popov are the leading promoters for more than 50 events. Since mid 2005, EXo is involved in every single H.M.S.U. event. EXo also drives the Mirizma events – a musical platform for experimental and downtemp performances.

8. Ukrainian group EXO is made by ex-members of Skryabin band Rostislav ""Roy"" Domishevsky and Sergij ""Shura"" Gera (also member of ""Dazzle Dreams"" and ""Druga Rika""). By this time they have made only one album in 2004. Guyz are following the style of old Skryabin.

Robin Pecknold and Skyler Skjelset both attended Lake Washington High School in Kirkland, a suburb of Seattle, and soon became close friends. Pecknold and Skjelset bonded over an appreciation of Bob Dylan and Neil Young and began making music together. Their parents influenced their musical tastes early on—Skjelset's mother Peggi was a keen listener to both Dylan and Hank Williams while Pecknold's father Greg was a member of The Fathoms, a local 1960s soul group. The two shared an interest in the music of Dylan and Brian Wilson. Pecknold played bass for Seattle's Dolour on a US tour in 2005, shortly before forming the first incarnation of Fleet Foxes.

Originally going by the name ""The Pineapples"", a name clash with another local band prompted a change and Pecknold decided upon ""Fleet Foxes"", suggesting that it was ""evocative of some weird English activity like fox hunting"". Pecknold took up the role of principal songwriter, both singing and playing guitar, while Skjelset played lead guitar. The original lineup was filled out by Casey Wescott on keyboards and backing vocals, Bryn Lumsden on bass and Nicholas Peterson on drums and backing vocals.

Pecknold's late-sixties pop style caught the attention of the Seattle producer Phil Ek and he helped them record their first demo in 2006, the self-released Fleet Foxes EP. Ek was impressed with the band's songwriting, and on hearing Pecknold for the first time, noted, ""It was obvious he had talent coming out of his ass."" By late 2006 the Seattle press began to take notice of the band; Tom Scanlon of the Seattle Times stated that he was impressed with the band's lyrics and musical maturity. By the end of the year, Lumsden had been replaced on bass by Craig Curran, who would also handle many of the band's vocal harmonies.

With growing popularity on the local circuit, the band set about making their first album in early 2007, spending time in the studio with producer Ek in addition to recording material at home. However, funds for recording were tight, so the band members cobbled together what funds they had, which limited the time they had in the studio, and so the majority of the tracks were recorded in various band members' apartments, other spaces, or the basement of Pecknold's parents' house.

Sun Giant and Fleet Foxes (2007–08)
Fleet Foxes were becoming increasingly popular and by late 2007, they had attracted over a quarter of a million song plays over two months on their Myspace site. Although the band had not released any of their recordings, they benefited from word of mouth exposure and their success soon translated into a record deal, signing with Warner Music subsidiary record label Sub Pop on January 18, 2008. According to Sub Pop's A&R, Sue Busch, at the time of signing the band was still a relatively primitive set-up, being without manager or legal representation. Robin's sister Aja Pecknold then assumed the role of band manager. The band's frontman, Robin Pecknold, attributes much of their success and popularity to illegal file sharing.

The band tracked their second EP, Sun Giant, at Bear Creek Studio and performed overdubs and mixed at Seattle's Avast! Recording Co., around the same time in preparation for upcoming tours. Fleet Foxes began their spring tour with another Northwest band Blitzen Trapper on February 28, 2008. Before the recording of the EP, bassist Curran was replaced by Christian Wargo, whose voice, like that of his predecessor, would become an important part of the band's harmony blend. The band's performances, first at the SXSW festival in March 2008, and then the Sasquatch! festival in May 2008, moved the band into the public consciousness, notably attracting attention from the European press for the first time.

Sun Giant was released internationally on April 8, 2008 and the group's brand of folk, rock and pop, marked by their use of vocal harmonies, was well received by the press. Despite the warm critical reception, the group said that the EP did not represent their full ambitions, serving merely as a CD to sell while on tour. In May 2008, the band chose to extend their North American and European tour until September in support of their forthcoming album. At this time Josh Tillman replaced Peterson on drums and backing vocals. Their first full-length album, Fleet Foxes, was released shortly afterwards on June 3, 2008. The album achieved similar critical success as the previous EP. Fleet Foxes received four out of five stars from Rolling Stone, which compared it to the likes of the Beach Boys, Animal Collective, and Crosby, Stills & Nash, and a 9.0 out of 10 in a review by Pitchfork Media, sharing the website's album of the year rank with the Sun Giant EP. The Guardian was particularly complimentary, awarding the album five stars and declaring it ""a landmark in American music — an instant classic"". On June 24, 2008, Fleet Foxes went to No. 1 on the CMJ Radio 200 Chart. The album achieved an average rating of 87/100 from 30 critic reviews on the aggregator website Metacritic.

While the group enjoyed moderate success in the United States, Fleet Foxes was better received in Europe, selling over 200,000 copies in the five months following its release. The sales were matched with critical plaudits and their debut album won Uncut's first ever Music Award 2008 prize. Uncut's editor, Allan Jones, said the album ""showed impeccable musicianship, and although you could trace its antecedents, it sounded totally unique. Fleet Foxes was just a glorious debut."" The band sold out music venues for their tours of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, reaffirming their growing popularity.

At the end of 2008, Fleet Foxes was rated album of the year by Billboard's Critic's Choice and in Metacritic's end of year best album round-up it appeared in 17 lists, topping six of them. Furthermore, it had sold over 408,000 copies in North America and over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom, making it the first gold certificate record for UK label Bella Union. Their growing profile enabled the band to make televised appearances, playing on Vincent Moon's La Blogotheque in December 2008 and on Saturday Night Live the following January. In 2009, they toured in Europe to favorable reviews; the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said their show in Paradiso induced goosebumps. In 2008 and 2009, the band played globally ending the tour in September with a final European leg.

Helplessness Blues (2009–12)
Pecknold said that he would have liked the album to be released in 2009; however, the band's touring schedule delayed rehearsals of the new songs until February 2009. These sessions took place in a rented house outside Seattle, but were mostly scrapped, losing the band $60,000 of their own money. Further delays ensued because the drummer, Tillman, was scheduled to play a solo tour in Europe and North America throughout the 2009–10 winter. Pecknold later sent some demos to producer Phil Ek and expressed the hope that the second LP would emerge in late 2010.

In December 2009, Pecknold said he wanted the new LP to sound ""less poppy, less upbeat and more groove-based"". He referenced the 12-string guitar sound from Roy Harper's folk album Stormcock, saying, ""That will be the primary sonic distancing from the last record."" He wanted the band to record very quickly, with ""vocal takes in one go, so even if there are fuck-ups, I want them to be on there. I want there to be guitar mistakes. I want there to be not totally flawless vocals. I want to record it and have that kind of cohesive sound. Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, to me, is the best-sounding album because it sounds like there were only six hours in the universe for that album to be recorded in. So I want it to have that feeling."" The band eventually began recording in April 2010 in various locations (including West Hurley, New York) under the label Reciprocal Recording and decided to scrap the earlier idea of a fast recording (though according to the band many of the initial vocals were done in one take). The album features a new six-piece band line up, with the addition of the former Blood Brothers bassist Morgan Henderson on upright bass and woodwind instruments.

The album, Helplessness Blues, was released on May 3, 2011 with a cover illustrated by the Seattle artist Toby Liebowitz and painted by Christopher Alderson. The title track was released via free download on January 31, 2011, and the album's fourth track, ""Battery Kinzie"", was premiered in the UK on Zane Lowe's radio show on March 22, 2011. The Sub Pop record label released a downloadable music video of the track ""Grown Ocean"", with footage of the album's recording, on its website in support of the album. A 12"" vinyl double A-side single of ""Helplessness Blues"" and ""Grown Ocean"" was released for Record Store Day on April 16, 2011. On November 1, 2011, Pecknold's brother, Sean Pecknold, released the official music video for ""The Shrine / An Argument"".

Helplessness Blues was nominated as Best Folk Album at the 2012 Grammy Awards, held February 12, 2012.

Departure of Tillman and hiatus (2012–2016)
On January 18, 2012, after the band had finished touring for the album, drummer Tillman announced that he had left the band. He would go on to reinvent himself and record several albums as Father John Misty, notable for his ironic sense of humor in lyrics and media as well as often criticizing both the record industry and society in interviews and on stage.

In October 2020, Pecknold reflected on Tillman's departure during a Reddit AMA: ""[Josh] ""quit"" the band after recording drums for Helplessness, got into narcotics and made his first Father John Misty album while I was making Helplessness in Seattle. Then Sub Pop offered to put out his album, but only if he delayed it for a year or so and toured Helplessness with us. Which we all weakly agreed to going through with, but it quickly became obvious he'd rather have just been doing that project instead, and I would have rathered that as well. So that tour I had to endure being around a lot of substance abuse, sabotaged shows, just general ill treatment, shit-talking, all while paying him for songs he didn't have anything to do with. It sucked!""

On June 15, 2013, an image of a home recording set-up–including a laptop computer, microphone and guitar–was posted on the Fleet Foxes Facebook page with the caption ""Step one"". On June 16, 2013, an image of a broken mandolin with the caption ""Step two"" was posted. These images were later deleted, but led to speculation that the group was working on a new project, possibly a third studio album. On April 23, 2014, Robin Pecknold posted to the band's Facebook page that he had moved to New York to get his undergraduate degree at the Columbia University School of General Studies, a liberal arts college of Columbia University in New York City.

Crack-Up (2016–2018)
On May 18, 2016, while answering fan questions on his Instagram account, Pecknold confirmed that Fleet Foxes were working on new material with drummer and frequent collaborator Neal Morgan, best known for his work with Joanna Newsom and Bill Callahan. Describing Morgan as a ""full Fox"", Pecknold also admitted he ""had to up my songwriting game for homeboy."" However, when Pecknold posted a photo of the band minus Morgan on Instagram, he clarified that Morgan was one of three drummers involved in the new album, and that for the time being Fleet Foxes would consist of Pecknold, Skjelset, Wescott, Wargo, and Henderson as a ""five-piece 'core band'"", but they would still use a drummer for live performances and additional musicians for certain shows. Pecknold also said that the new material would be ""a different vibe"" compared to Fleet Foxes' previous output. On November 14, 2016, the band confirmed (via their Facebook account) that their new album was nearly complete.

On December 25, 2016, Pecknold posted a photo on his Instagram account which showed four albums in the Fleet Foxes' queue in his iTunes library: the first studio album Fleet Foxes; the Sun Giant EP; the second studio album Helplessness Blues; and an unknown third album entitled Ylajali. This led to speculation that the band's third album would: 1) be named after a character from Knut Hamsun's novel Hunger; 2) contain a photo from Japanese photographer Hiroshi Hamaya as the cover art; and 3) be released through Nonesuch Records, since the label's logo can be seen on the album cover.

In an email newsletter on January 1, 2017, production company Mason Jar Music confirmed that Fleet Foxes was working on a new album, since they contributed to the production. The album was called Crack-Up, after an F. Scott Fitzgerald essay of the same name. The album is a concept album and was recorded at Electric Lady Studios and Sear Sound in New York City.

On March 7, 2017, Fleet Foxes announced their third studio album, Crack-Up, released on June 16, 2017 via Nonesuch Records, a new label for the band. The lead single, ""Third of May / Ōdaigahara"", was released the same day. On April 4, 2017, the band posted the album trailer for the new album on YouTube. The trailer briefly presents various songs from the album and shows some images while they were recording them. The video was made by Sean Pecknold, Robin's brother.

On May 15, 2017, Fleet Foxes made their live return at the Wilma Theatre in Missoula, in which they performed nine songs from Crack-Up along with a selection of older material and a cover of ""In the Morning"" by Bee Gees. The band's current live line-up includes Matt Barrick of The Walkmen, who is also the most heavily featured of the three guest drummers who contributed to Crack-Up. Barrick has continued to play with the band, but has not become an official member. The new album also included the sounds of a brass quartet called The Westerlies.

On October 10, 2017, the band announced the release of a new EP, entitled The Electric Lady Session, for Black Friday Record Store Day 2017. The EP was released on November 24 of that year, and is a collection of live performances of four songs from Crack-Up, originally recorded for their session at Fordham University’s radio station WFUV. For Record Store Day 2018, the band released another EP, entitled ""Crack Up (Choral Version)""/""In The Morning (Live in Switzerland)"", in collaboration with the Icelandic female choir, Graduale Nobili.

Shore (2019–present)
On December 31, 2018, Pecknold teased several new demos online for an upcoming new album.

137,137,rita ora,1203830,25212267,"Rita Sahatçiu Ora, better known as Rita Ora, is a Kosovar-British singer-songwriter from London, UK. Born in Prishtina, Kosovo in 1990, Ora's family moved to London where she was raised. According to the Hot Right Now Songfacts, during her early teens Ora attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School, whose other notable alumni include Emma Bunton and Amy Winehouse. 

Her first UK exposure came after several collaborations with British singer Craig David. In 2009, she also auditioned for BBC talent competition 'Your Country Needs You' – to select the United Kingdom's entrant for the Eurovision Song Contest – but withdrew her application.

In 2009, she signed a recording contract with Jay-Z's label Roc Nation and relocated to America. The How We Do (Party) Songfacts reports that when Ora visited Clear Channel with Jay-Z to present music and videos from her debut release, the executives were so enthused by what they heard that they organised for How We Do (Party)  to be immediately premiered on DJ JJ's afternoon show on New York's top hit music station WHTZ (Z100). Her debut album ORA was released on 26th August, 2012.

In December 2015, Ora filed a lawsuit against Roc Nation, seeking release from the label and citing that the contract she signed in 2008 is ""unenforceable"", due to California's ""seven-year rule."" The complaint stated that she's ""only been permitted to release one album despite creating multiple additional records for release"" and that her relationship with Roc Nation is ""irrevocably damaged."" Her complaint also pointed out a breach of contract, reporting that Roc Nation breached the recording agreement by improperly taking twenty percent commission of her income. In January 2016, Roc Nation filed a counter-lawsuit against Ora for breaking her recording contract. They reached a settlement in May 2016. In June 2016, it was reported that she signed a new record deal with Atlantic Records and Warner Music Group.

Ora's second studio album, Phoenix, was released in November 2018. The lead single, ""Your Song"", reached the UK top ten; and the subsequent singles, ""Anywhere"" and ""Let You Love Me"", reached the top five in the UK. ""Let You Love Me"" allowed Ora to become the first British female solo artist to have thirteen top ten songs in the United Kingdom. Phoenix was supported by the ""Phoenix World Tour"" which began March 1st, 2018 and commenced July 16th, 2019.

In September 2019, Ora revealed she had begun work on her third studio album. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Rita+Ora"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Following his 2018 debut album ""Bad Contestant"" and acclaimed 2019 album ""Krystal"", which endeared him to tastemaker outlets like NME, NPR, Line Of Best Fit, Vice, Interview, DIY, Dork and more, his appropriately titled EP ""madhouse"" isn't just a score for the everyday boredoms we encounter.

Maltese has always nailed lonesome provocations with idiosyncratic dry wit but ""madhouse"" reckons with those emotions in a way the half Brittish, half Canadian hasn't yet fully explored until now. ""I've found that sometimes the majority of the emotional journey of love and life is actually the search for an understanding of it.

Desde su salida, obtienen un éxito con su primer CD, al que titularon ""Para los pibes"", llevándolos a los mejores rankins de la cumbia en Argentina, Paraguay y Chile y popularizando el estilo de ""cumbia villera"" con el tema ""Se te ve la tanga"". Recientemente ya llegaron a presentarse en Mexico especialmente en Monterrey donde realizaron bailes masivos logrando en el auditorio coca cola un lleno impresionante de alrrededor de 20,000 personas y en el lugar de origen de la cumbia, Colombia, siendo el primer grupo argentino del genero de cumbia villera en trascender tanto internacionalmente.

La banda fue creada por Pablo Lescano. Anteriormente Pablo había integrado la prestigiosa banda Amar Azul en calidad de teclista. También fue el creador, el compositor y el alma del primer grupo de ""cumbia villera"" de Argentina Flor de Piedra, aunque no participó como músico en ella. Quién si lo hizo fue Romina Lescano, su hermana, que luego lo acompañó en Damas Gratis.

El estilo que empezó a asomar con Flor de Piedra alcanzó el máximo de profesionalismo con Damas Gratis. Hizo explosión y se consolidó en un indiscutible éxito relegando decenas de imitaciones a rol secundario.

Damas Gratis, sin letras románticas, melodías melosas ni carilindos colocó nuevamente a nuestra música tropical en los más variados sectores sociales, logro alcanzado por muy pocos grupos en la historia de la movida tropical.

La música y el ritmo de Damas Gratis continuó avanzando hasta trascender los límites de la música tropical, así lo reflejan diversos artículos publicados en diarios líderes en sus respectivos países como ser: Clarín, La Nación, El País, Buenos Aires Herald y revistas como Noticias o Rolling Stone, que también se ocuparon de este fenómeno que revolucionó la movida tropical y a la vez ubicó en los canales de televisión un rico debate alrededor de la cultura de las villas.


 Música de películas  [editar]Las melodías de Pablo Lescano siguen rompiendo fronteras culturales, ya que el filme del argentino Pablo Trapero ""El Bonaerense"", llegó a Francia al ""Festival de Cine de Cannes"" y su banda de sonido es de Pablo Lescano con ""Damas Gratis"". Este material es un símbolo además de la integración: una rareza para el “culto” como para el cumbiambero (banda de sonido ""El Bonaerense"").

It wasn't until summer of 2009 when Block witnessed how talented Jacquees was and shifted his vision. Jacquees began to work closely with Block Entertainment recording and gaining more exposure with the release of his first single ""Krazy"" featuring Grand Hustle's own, T.I.

""Only better!"" 

""It's truly a blessing to have the opportunity to work with the artist and producers I have already worked with,"" says Jacquees.

148,148,chris lake,628535,6428874,"Globally recognised as one of the most exciting, forward thinking and cutting edge producers on the scene, Chris Lake's rare ability to create tracks that fuse elements of house, electro and techno has not been lost on his fellow peers. His innovative productions continue to receive wave after wave of support from such luminaries that include Sasha, Danny Howells, Justin Robertson, Sander Kleinenberg and Carl Cox, whilst Pete Tong leads the way in championing the unique sound that has established Chris as one of the world's elite.

An avid producer since 2001, Chris's breakthrough came in 2005. His tracks 'One Too Many' and 'Release' caught the attention of the world's press and A&R bosses, but it was the release of his smash hit 'Changes' that catapulted his name into the record boxes of DJs across the planet.

'Changes' became Radio 1's 'Essential New Tune' twice, reaching number 27 in the national charts and picking up column inches in tabloid papers and magazines; turning the once underground buzzer into a worldwide hit.

Chris's DJ schedule duly sky rocketed and over the past 2 years, he has travelled to all four corners of the globe taking in Asia, South America, USA, Australia and Africa. He has graced some of the biggest clubs on the planet that include Ministry Of Sound, Space, Warung, Spybar and Amnesia together with countless festivals - Global Gathering, Creamfields and the Extrema festival in Holland.

In 2006, Chris set up Rising Music as an outlet for his new productions. Rising swiftly became the benchmark for pure underground house - releases that included 'One Too Many', 'Fantasy' and 'Release' have set the standard, whilst Chris has also shown that his A&R head is amongst the best in the business by signing artists that include Sebastien Leger, Micky Slim and Deadmau5.

Chris's success continued in 2007 with his track 'Carry Me Away' hitting the coveted number one spot on the USA Billboard Dance Chart, thus etching his name into the dance history books and propelling his US profile into the stratosphere.

Further collaborations in 2007 with Deadmau5 on 'I thought inside out' and Sebastien Leger 'Word/Ghost' once again proved Chris's versatility in the studio, and with both productions hitting the Beatport Top spot, Chris continued to cement his status as one of the world's finest producers.

And of course there is the small matter of Chris remixing some of the biggest names in the music scene. Robbie Williams, Kylie Minogue, Mark Ronson, Lily Allen, Deadmau5 and the Rogue Traders are amongst some of the names to have received sublime workouts from Chris, and support has been immense; not only from Radio 1, but every major radio station around the world.

Radio 1 has also allowed Chris to show his unrivalled ability in the art of DJ'ing. His Essential Mix in August 2007 was yet another defining step in his career as he unveiled two hours of sublime techno, electro and tech house to keep a worldwide audience of millions captivated. His mix was voted as one of the best since the inception of the Essential Mix series, and reminded everyone why Chris is at the top of his trade.

2008 has seen Chris's profile grow even bigger with his global DJ tours, top quality releases, and an eye for the new media world via his new Podcast series - the latter of which has made i-Tunes' 'new and notable' for the last three months. Meanwhile his stunning track 'Only One' taken from his One E.P has held its place in Beatport's Top 5 for more than two weeks, and is currently climbing the US and Australian dance charts faster than ever.

His latest track doing the rounds is 'If you knew', a track Pete Tong reckons is ""sounding like a cross between 'Changes' and the song 'Pjanoo' never had - conventional but huge... and we haven't had a song like this for a while.""

Chris shows no signs of slowing down, and with demand for his sound even higher than ever, you can be sure to see his name up in lights for many years to come.

She went back to Brooklyn two years later at age 21 to record her debut album, Youth Novels, which was released in Sweden on January 30, 2008.

Stump originally auditioned as a drummer, but soon became the lead singer. The following year, the band debuted with a self-released demo and followed it up with the May 28, 2002 release of Split EP, which featured Project Rocket, on Uprising Records. The group released a mini-LP, Evening Out With Your Girlfriend, also on Uprising Records, in 2003.

2003–2004: Independent success

After the release of their mini-album, Fall Out Boy built a large following playing in the Chicago area. Drummer  Andy Hurley, formerly of Racetraitor, joined the band, while Mike Pareskuwicz and T.J. Kunasch left. At this time, Stump also took over rhythm guitar duties. After signing to Fueled By Ramen, they released their first full-length album, Take This to Your Grave, on May 6, 2003.

With singles Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy and Saturday receiving video airplay on FUSE and mtvU and radio airplay on alternative stations across the country, the band soon gained a cult following. The album sold very well and eventually achieved gold status, but only after the success of their next album, From Under The Cork Tree.

In mid-2003 the band signed with Island Records, part of the super label The Island Def Jam Music Group along with Def Jam Records. While recording their mainstream debut, they released the acoustic EP My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue on Fueled by Ramen, May 18, 2004.

It also reached #6 on the Pop 100 and became the bands top charted hit when it reached #2 on the Modern Rock Charts. The video for the song premiered on TRL on October 11, 2005; it soon reached #1 and was later retired on January 17, 2006. The third single off the album, A Little Less Sixteen Candles, A Little More ‘Touch Me’, was much less popular than both prior singles but still managed to peak at #65 on the Hot 100 and hit #1 twice on TRL, retiring on June 6, 2006.

On April 1, 2008, Fall Out Boy released their live album, **** Live in Phoenix. The album was recorded in Pheonix on June 22. It contained a studio recording of Micheal Jackson’s Beat It with John Mayer as a guest on the guitar.

On December 16th, 2008, Fall Out Boy released their 4th studio album, Folie à Deux (literally meaning “madness shared by two”). The lead single for the album, I Don’t Care was released September 8, 2008.

Along with the release of this compilation, Fall Out Boy announced that they were taking a break. ""We're just taking a break and decompressing. We're not putting terms on when we're coming back. We're going to come back when everybody's excited about it and it's fun."" said Pete Wentz to J14 Magazine.

2010-2012: Hiatus

In early 2010 the band entered a state of hiatus, with each member eventually going off to explore their own musical interests. Wentz formed DJ duo Black Cards with singer Bebe Rexha in July 2010, releasing an EP before Rexha quietly left the group in January 2012. Trohman and Hurley started the band The Damned Things with Scott Ian from Anthrax and members of Every Time I Die, releasing their debut album Ironiclast in December 2010.

Stump recorded his debut solo album Soul Punk which was released on July 26, 2011. Despite gaining generally positive reviews, ticket sales were poor with many Fall Out Boy fans unwilling to follow him in his new musical direction. This negative feedback caused Stump to create his blog entry ""We Liked You Better Fat"" in which he honestly aired his feelings, causing Wentz to reach out to him and ultimately begin collborating again musically in February 2012.

2013-2014: Reunion and Save Rock and Roll

During 2012, the band reformed and began attempts to reinvent their sound. Sessions were difficult, with early attempts a struggle to produce new material.

170,170,ikon,536041,16736964,"There is more than one artist with the name Ikon;

1) IKON is an Australian goth/darkwave band that has gained an international following.   Chris McCarter(vocals, guitar, programming) and Dino Molinaro (bass) began to create music as high school students in  Melbourne, Australia in 1988. In 1991, their band Death in the Dark, which included Michael Carrodus on vocals, changed its name to IKON. 

IKON has released five studio albums, five EPs and seventeen singles, with additional unique versions that have been produced for Germany, America and Russia. The band’s last full-length release, Destroying the World to Save It, attained number 21 on the Native DJ World Charts for best album of 2005. 
  
IKON has frequently toured Australia, Europe and the UK. IKON has played on the same bill as The Sisters of Mercy, H.I.M., Soft Cell, Death in June, London After Midnight and The Mission. IKON has performed at the Eurorock Festival (2001) in Belgium and at the M’era Luna Festival (2002) in Hildesheim, Germany before an audience of more than 15,000 people. The band has also appeared three times at the world’s largest goth festival, Wave Gotik Treffen in Leipzig, Germany, in 2003, 2005 (during that year Anthony Cornish joined the live line-up on guitar) and 2011. 

In 2007, the band embarked upon ‘The Burden of History’ tour of Europe to mark the release of the singles collection (1992-2007) of the same name. The  EPs League of Nations (2007) and Amongst the Runes (2008) demonstrate a progression in IKON’s signature sound, providing a taster of the forthcoming album Love, Hate and Sorrow (to be released in September 2009). While retaining the essence of influences such as Joy Division, early New Order and Death in June, the future for IKON promises to add further texture to the band’s style. Love, Hate and Sorrow embraces more melodic song structures without entirely relinquishing the shadowy threads that are interweaved in the lyrics, art work, and music of one of the world’s most successful and enduring darkwave bands. The single ""A Line on a Dark Day"" from the album will also be made into the band's first video clip.

2) A UK collaborative project of Elliot Ireland and Alex Rizzo, the people behind the Jalapeno label. They utilise a wide range of guest vocalists and instrumentalists to create an interesting fusion of dnb, jazz, downtempo and triphop. They have released a self-titled album and at least 2 singles, 'The Dove' and 'Tricolour'. The album took a long time to make and was created in 7 different countries with 8 different collaborations, in languages such as Portuguese and English.

From the Jalapeno Records Website on Ikon:
""As for the Ikon sound it's tricky to categorise: bossa nova melodies seem to seep effortlessly into epic cinematic productions, which mutate into slick drum and bass rhythms.""
""Musically the group cites most genres as being influential to the Ikon sound, particularly jazz, funk, soul and hip hop.""
""What the hell is Ikon about? ""Happy coincidences,"" opines co-founding member Alex Rizzo with a smile."" 
""Ikon is about producing lush, imaginative music and recreating sounds in an original way. Give us a keyboard a string, synth or computer- Rolf Harris's stylophone and we'll play it- the quirkier the better. If there's a sound we wanna emulate we'll try and get the original materials: like a 60s bass and a 60s mic to get the right effect.""

Dinos naît le 30 novembre 1993 à Douala, au Cameroun, et arrive en France à l'âge de 4 ans avec sa famille où ils s'installent dans la cité des 4000 à La Courneuve, en Seine-Saint-Denis. Il sort son premier projet, Thumbs Up, en 2011, puis commence à se faire un nom dans les Rap Contenders, où deux MCs s'affrontent a capella.

En mai 2013, Dinos signe sur le label Def Jam France et, le 3 juin 2013, sort un EP intitulé L'alchimiste en référence au livre du même nom de Paulo Coelho.

Courant 2014, Dinos quitte Def Jam France pour Capitol Music France et sort, le 14 avril 2014, un second EP intitulé Apparences, porté par le titre Namek; lequel rencontre un certain succès.

Après une longue période d'absence sur le devant de la scène il annonce son premier album Imany qu'il ne sortira que 2 ans après. Entre l'annonce de cet album et la sortie de celui-ci, il sort Pas Imany mais presque en 2016. Dinos marque son retour le 8 décembre 2017 avec le titre Flashé. Le 30 mars 2018, il dévoile le single Les pleurs du mal. Le 27 avril 2018, Dinos sort Imany, son premier album studio. Malgré un succès critique quasi-unanime, l'album ne fait que 3.131 ventes lors de sa première semaine d'exploitation. Il faut cependant préciser que cet album est très personnel et ne comporte aucun son destiné à être un succès commercial Le 20 août 2018, il participe à Colors, émission musicale allemande très populaire sur YouTube, et livre une prestation live de son titre Argentique. Il participe au projet 93 Empire produit par Affranchis Music (Sofiane), ou il est présent sur 2 titres (Drive By feat Sadek et Ixzo et Viens dans mon 93 feat Sofiane et Hornet La Frappe).

Viennent ensuite les titres Mack le Bizz Freestyle et Oskur, tous deux clippés. Avec Taciturne, Dinos écoule 7815 exemplaires en 1 semaine d'exploitation. Un score honorable d'autant plus que Dinos a sorti son album le même jour que Gradur et SCH, deux rappeurs habitués aux grands succès commerciaux. cela ne l’empêchera pas d'avoir son premier disque d'or plusieurs semaines avant la sortie de son dernier album Stamina,

Le 27 novembre 2020, il publie Stamina, son troisième album. Alors que l'album a réservé son lot de surprises, notamment la présence de featurings cachés, il a aussi rencontré un franc succès, que ce soit critique mais aussi commercial. Et pour preuve, selon les chiffres de ventes annoncés par Ventes Rap, ce troisième album de Dinos s'est écoulé à 23 236 équivalent ventes en première semaine.

174,174,katy perry,6129368,329698808,"Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson, known professionally as Katy Perry (born October 25, 1984 in Santa Barbara, CA) is an American singer, songwriter, and television judge. The story of who was born into a totally Christian environment and who years later would become a pop music star. Muse of those who feel different or excluded, Katy Perry got her first guitar (from the church) at the age of thirteen and dreamed of it, as many young people do. The difference is that she did it. She broke free from the shackles of faith (without ever losing it) and set out to live through songs about her experiences. The result? Aside from Michael Jackson, only she was able to place five songs from the same album at the top of the charts.

 After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name 'Katy Perry' and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.

Perry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, One of the Boys, a pop rock record containing the controversial U.S number one song ""I Kissed a Girl"" and ""Hot n Cold"". Three subsequent albums have topped the U.S. Billboard 200. The disco-influenced Teenage Dream (2010) spawned five chart-topping U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles–""California Gurls"", ""Teenage Dream"", ""Firework"", ""E.T."", and ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"" — a record tying her with Michael Jackson's ""Bad"". Its follow-up record Prism (2013) was inspired by her divorce, and incorporates pop and dance along with themes of self-reflection, everyday life, and relationships. With the music videos for its chart-topping songs ""Roar"" and ""Dark Horse"", Perry became the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on Vevo.  Her 2017 electropop album,  'Witness' featured a political subtext and a theme of liberation. Her sixth studio album 'Smile' followed in 2020.

Perry has nine U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one singles and has received various awards, including four Guinness World Records, five Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award. She has been included in the annual Forbes lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011 to 2019. Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. Perry is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 18 million albums and 125 million singles worldwide. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled ""Katy Perry: Part of Me"" in 2012, and voiced Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs and its sequel in 2013. Her Super Bowl halftime show performance is the most watched in history. Perry also began serving as a judge on American Idol in 2018. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

180,180,red velvet,1113117,196622717,"There are three artists who go by Red Velvet:
1) k-pop
2) Italian musician
3) future funk

1) Red Velvet (레드벨벳) is a five-member South Korean girl group formed by SM Entertainment in 2014. The group consists of Irene (아이린), Seulgi (슬기), Wendy (웬디), Joy (조이), and Yeri (예리). Their name is a play on their dual concept of ""red"" and ""velvet;"" the ""red"" half is their brighter and bubblier side, while their ""velvet"" image is their softer, more mature and elegant concept.

Debuting in 2014, Red Velvet was originally a four-member group. Three of the original four members of Red Velvet were previously part of S.M. Entertainment's pre-debut team, SM Rookies. Seulgi, the first member who joined the agency, was brought in through an audition in 2007. Irene, the next member to join the company, was cast in 2009. Joy, the member who wasn't part of SM Rookies, auditioned through the SM Global Audition in Seoul in 2012. As part of SM Rookies, several clips of Irene and Seulgi were released on S.M. Entertainment's official YouTube account. The three members were rumored to debut as a group in July 2014, which was then later confirmed by SM Entertainment. With the addition of member Joy, the four-member group would debut as Red Velvet - SM Entertainment's first girl group in five years, after f(x).

Red Velvet's debut single ""행복 (Happiness)"" was digitally released on August 4, 2014. The music video was released on August 1, and later become the second most viewed K-pop video worldwide in August 2014; on the same day, the group made their official debut stage on the music program Music Bank.

Red Velvet released their second digital single ""Be Natural"" on October 13, 2014. It is a remake of a song by veteran SM Entertainment girl group, S.E.S.. The track features Taeyong, former member of SM Rookies' male unit named SR14B, as well as a member of NCT. The group started their promotional activities for this release on October 9, making their first appearance on the music program, M! Countdown. The music video for the song was released on the same day.

On March 11, 2015, SM Entertainment released a video announcing the addition of a new member to the group's lineup—Yeri. On March 14, ""Automatic,"" the group's first music video featuring Yeri, was released. The following day, they released their first mini-album ""Ice Cream Cake"", along with the music video for ""Ice Cream Cake."" It was also announced by S.M. Entertainment that both ""Automatic"" and ""Ice Cream Cake"" would be promoted as double lead singles of the album. 

In early September 2015, S.M. Entertainment announced that the group would be making a comeback, and on September 9, 2015, Red Velvet released their first full length album ""The Red"". The album features ten tracks, including the title track, ""Dumb Dumb."" The album focuses on their ""red"" image, which is supposed to be the group's bright and bold side. On December 18, 2015, the group took part in S.M. Entertainment's special winter project, Winter Garden, alongside label-mates f(x) and BoA, releasing a digital single titled ""세가지 소원 (Wish Tree).""

While promoting ""The Red"", it was hinted at by the members and S.M. Entertainment that there would be a follow up album, but nothing was confirmed at that time. In March 2016, it was announced that the group would make a comeback with the group's second mini album. ""The Velvet"" was released on March 17, 2016 as a direct follow up to their first album ""The Red"".

The extended play contained seven tracks, including the title track ""Power Up"" and a bonus track of their popular song ""Bad Boy"" recorded in English. The album peaked at #1 on the Gaon Album Chart. 

After the release of ""Summer Magic"", news about Red Velvet's upcoming comeback circulated in October 2018, which SM Entertainment responded to by confirming a November comeback. SM Entertainment later revealed the details of the extended play along with the title of the lead single: ""RBB (Really Bad Boy).""

On July 6, 2020, the group's first sub-unit was formed. Red Velvet - Irene & Seulgi released their first mini album with ""Monster"" as the title track. The album also featured a solo song for the group's lead vocalist, Seulgi. On July 19, they dropped a single titled ""Naughty."" It was remixed soon afterwards.

On January 1, 2021, their company, SM Entertainment, hosted the Culture Humanity free online concert featuring many of their artists.

Their first release of 2022, ""Feel My Rhythm,"" was released on March 21, marking the return of The ReVe Festival. The mini album consisted of 6 songs, the title track sampling ""Aria on the G String."" The song effortlessly mixes elegant classical music with a modern, upbeat pop sound.

As the third member of the group to debut solo, Seulgi released her first EP  ""28 Reasons,"" on October 4, 2022, alongside the title track of the same name.

The group has been endlessly praised for their diverse concepts and uniqueness. In November 2019, Billboard crowned Red Velvet as ""the best idol group alive.""

Born into a cosmopolitan family scattered all around the world, one day Joe Bel chose to interrupt her “History of Art and Literature” studies to plunge into music. As a self-taught musician & singer, her instincts drove her to give her first solo gigs with a guitar in 2012. Less than a year later, Asaf Avidan offered her to open his concerts on his 2013’s Tour. She seized the chance to share this experience with him all around Europe and performed in many venues and concert halls such as the Olympia (Paris, France)! Then, shortly after her own German Tour on summer 2014, Joe Bel locked herself in a recording studio, and now - in 2015 - is happy to release her second EP ""Hit the Roads"", which is full of with vibrant bass, intense rhythms and inspired piano melodies. Then many live performances in Europe (Sziget 2015, Brussels Summer Festival 2015, etc.) and a label deal signed in Sept. 2015 with Naïve, the very nice French music label, home of the wonderful Jeanne Added. Now the future comes with a role in a movie “Tout pour être heureux” starring Manu Payet, Audrey Lamy and many others famous French talents (TB released in April 2016), an O.S.T, and a first LP likely to be released by summer or September 2016.

195,195,jid,1125894,74551018,"Destin Route (b. October 31, 1990), better known by the stage name JID, is an American rapper from Zone 6, Atlanta, Georgia. He describes himself as “a soft-spoken but intricate lyricist with a cocky side.” His stage name originates from “jittery,” his grandmother’s nickname for him due to his sporadic behavior as a child.

He first appeared on the Atlanta hip-hop scene with his debut EP, DiCaprio, in 2015. Growing up, JID's first connection with music was through his parents' collection of classic funk and soul LPs. After a stint at Hampton University playing football, JID also hooked up with fellow MCs as part of the Spillage Village collective. By 2012, he had dropped out of college to focus on music, and in 2014 he headed out on what would be a productive tour with EarthGang, Bas, and Ab-Soul. Touring allowed JID to craft his skills, and a year later he recorded and dropped the DiCaprio EP, which saw him team up with a host of producers, as well as EarthGang. While keen to distance himself from the generic abrasive trap sound that had dominated the Atlanta scene, JID wanted to deliver something that was more than just about a beat, and instead focused his time and effort on lyrics as well. In 2016, JID, alongside the rest of the Spillage Village crew, released the album Bears Like This Too Much, which saw the rapper honing his unique delivery and inspired lyrics. In 2017, he announced that he had signed to J. Cole's Dreamville label (a connection made with the rapper via JID's part in the 2014 tour with Bas and Cole's friend and producer Cedric Brown), which released the single Never and full-length The Never Story at the beginning of the year. In September of 2018, he issued the single ""151 Rum,"" the first offering from DiCaprio 2, his sophomore full-length and sequel to his 2015 EP. Later that year he released the album ""Dicaprio 2"". JID released his most recent album, ""The Forever Story"" on August 26th, 2022, the two singles on the album, ""Surround Sound (feat. 21 Savage & Baby Tate)"" and ""Dance Now"" were released on January 14th 2022, and August 9th 2022 respectively. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Jid"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The character of Johnny il Pagante, created by students Guglielmo Panzera and Alfredo Tomasi, soon took on a life of his own, with many people believing he was real and sharing his hedonistic exploits on social media. The growing popularity of the page convinced its creators to try something new. Recruiting beatmakers @Merk & Kremont, rapper Edoardo Cremona (aka Eddy Veerus), and singers Federica Napoli and Roberta Branchini, they created a series of fake music videos starring Johnny. The page's popularity snowballed, with the videos accruing millions of views, and eventually the musical project became a viable concern in its own right, the trio performing live all over Italy to packed houses. Panzera and Tomasi continued to take a backroom role, writing the lyrics together with Cremona. The project's satirical nature and image, with a laddish frontman and two blonde bombshell singers, made it somewhat analogous to . Their sound was a smorgasbord of EDM styles, with elements of trance, Italo house, and reggaeton, and deliberately ridiculous overuse of AutoTune.

IZ*ONE debuted on October 29, 2018 with their first extended play COLOR*IZ. Upon its release, the group received immediate commercial success, selling over 225,000 units and peaking at number 2 on South Korea's Gaon Album Chart. In addition, both the EP and its lead single ""La Vie en Rose"" charted on Billboard World Albums and World Digital Songs respectively. The early success subsequently hailed them as the New Artist of the Year at several awards shows, including Golden Disc Awards and Seoul Music Awards.

(G)I-DLE reached significant popularity in a short timeframe, receiving their first-ever music show win on SBS MTV's The Show on May 22, 2018, twenty days after their debut. With only one mini-album and two singles, the group earned several rookie awards at major year-end music award shows, including the Asia Artist Awards, Gaon Chart Music Awards, Genie Music Awards, Golden Disc Awards, Korea Popular Music Awards and Melon Music Awards. As a result, many dubbed (G)I-DLE as the ""monster rookies"" of 2018. Their participation in the League of Legends' virtual girl group project K/DA further increased their popularity globally.

After two more Korean releases, (G)I-DLE made their debut in the Japanese market on July 31,2019.

The group continued to promote, releasing ""Last Dance"" as a collaboration with the platform UNIVERSE on April 29.

Ihr Debüt erschien im folgenden Frühling und wurde von Blogs, Radios und Magazinen weltweit aufgegriffen. Die erste Single „White Line Fever“ explodierte auf Soundcloud und YouTube nachdem sie eine Reihe einflussreicher USA-Blogger hypten.

230,230,kafu banton,38638,386345,"Zico Alberto Garibaldi Roberts, was born in1979 and raised in Pilon (Rio Alejandro), outside Colon, Panama. At the age of 10 he began to demonstrate his talent by singing Reggae in a group called The Youngsters of Reggae. The group consisted of five singers, Bebi King, Lucho Kiss, Mega D and Sicario (Kafu Banton). Zico later on decided to call himself KAFU BANTON after a Brazilian football player named Cafu.

Kafu borrowed his last name from one of the worlds biggest Reggae artists, and his inspiration, Buju Banton. Kafu studied in I.B.J.G College where, through a family member, he met one of the greatest national Reggae singer Ernesto Brown best known as (Ness). Ness introduced the world to Spanish Reggae, and Kafu followed Ness lead, letting himself be known in all kinds of Reggae music competitions at the national level. In October 1996 he won his way to number one in a competition at a club called Patatus 2 Caribe. This gave Kafu the opportunity to record a simple song called Mad Man produced by Rodney Clark El Chombo for Spanish Oil Productions. Kafu then participated in other productions under the label Oilers Music, contributing to Tales from the Crypt 2 & 3 compilations, which captured the attention of the public.

At the time Reggae was at its greatest in Panama, and Kafu along with other known artists of this generation, joined the rebirth of One Love, a group formed by Ness and the Sensations, also featuring Calito Soul, Papachan (R.I.P.), Original Dan and Bigga Man. Two years later, in 1998, due to the labels financial problems, Kafu left Oilers Music and began to work with Proarsa, a label owned by Ramon Bustamante Pucho. Kafu was again involved in various productions with the likes of Creations, Dementes, Da Crew and Sin Censura. In 2000, after having gained valuable production and business experience, Kafu produced his first album called The Best of Me which featured such gems as Pato, Way Way, Ya Estoy Cansado, El Sistema, Good Bye, Pueden Correr. The album made Kafu popular in Panama and abroad. He toured in Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, Colombia, the United States and Spain. Kafu's purpose as a lyricist is to try and change the way many people think, especially kids.

He watched as the Youth around him chose the wrong path in life, and never received the proper guidance. Kafu felt that music that conveys a positive and empowering message, was the most effective way to reach the Youth. Kafu also shares with his fans his struggle as a youth in an impoverished part of Panama, and his rise to better life through music and sheer will and determination. In 2005 Kafu Banton took his career in his own hands but creating events in the U.S and meeting key people in the states that believed in Reggae En Español. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kafu+Banton"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

235,235,ben mazué,76171,1297713,"Ben Mazue was born to a French teacher and an architect. He entered the music conservatory to study piano. Throughout his childhood, he and his parents lived in Biot and moved to the capital, Paris, in the following years. As a teenager, he decided to stay and settle in Paris while his parents returned to the south of France to Biot.

In addition to his piano studies, he also took courses in medicine. At the end of his various studies, he decided to take up music at the age of 25. In love with the knowledge of rap and soul music, he started to compose and to multiply his experiences as well as his friendships.

With his friend Augustin, Ben Mazue performed for a while as a duo in the bars of the capital and then went on to form a group called La Plage for at least three years. This is how he got the taste for performing on the city's stages and did not stop touring at the first opportunity.

Ben Mazue: an artist with a successful career
Ben Mazué won the Prix de la Découverte de la Sacem at the Festival Jacques Brel de Vesoul 2006. He also won the Paris Young Talent Award in June 2008 and the FAIR in 2010. He then performed a series of shows as the opening act for Anis, Tété and Hocus Pocus. Ben Mazué has also given numerous concerts on his own, notably at the Printemps de Bourges and Francofolies festivals.

He has released several albums, including Common Ground, his first 5-track album, released in 2007. Then, at the end of 2010, he released his second album with the help of guitarists Clément Simounet, Régis Ceccarelli and Jean-Pierre Sluys. Ben Mazué has also signed a contract with Columbia Label, a subsidiary of Sony Music. His first album was released in October 2011.

He released his track Confession, from his rap albums, Addicts and Mes Monuments as a single. The third single from the album, ""C'est Léger"", is sung with singer Pauline Croze. Ben Mazué has had several tours in France. In 2020, he released Paradis, his fourth album, which recounts the summary of his life in the wake of his separation.

Indeed, it is an album that also refers to the island of Reunion, which he affectionately calls his Paradise on Earth. Finally, during the years 2020 and 2021, he becomes with his song Quand je marche, the winner of the Charles Cros prize, one of the high school students of the ACC.

What is Ben Mazue's style of music?
Ben Mazue is without doubt the surprise of the contemporary rap world. This young man from Biot was not destined to be a rapper. However, it was when he arrived in Paris with his parents that he discovered it. It is through this style of music that he tries to drown his feelings on paper that he accompanies with rap music. His music has been influenced by the famous Alain Souchon, Renaud and Jacques Brel.

The essence of his music comes from rap, but also from African music and American soul. These different influences place him at the crossroads between grand slam, rap, soul music and reggae. In 2011, Ben Mazué made his name on the scene with his first album. It is an autobiographical album that raises awareness and shows that taking care of oneself means taking care of others.

Over the years, the artist has made a name for himself through his art and his desire to impact the world through his melodies. As a result, rapper Ben Mazué has become one of the icons of rap music in Europe and even worldwide.

Ajram studied music following her early success with renowned Lebanese musicians and although she was less than 18 years old, the syndicate of professional artists in Lebanon accepted her as a member because they found her to be an exceptional talent and deserved to be qualified as a professional artist. Shortly afterwards Nancy released her first album, Mihtagalak (""I Need You') in 1998, with most of its songs holding a pure Tarab style, thus starting her music career at the age of 15. It was followed by Sheel Oyoonak Anni (""Take Your Eyes Off Of Me"") in 2000, which achieved more success.

After coming off a bad deal with Columbia Records, Ne-Yo originally decided to remain as a songwriter until a close friend introduced him to L.A. Reid who signed him to Def Jam Records on the spot. 

The origin of the name Ne-Yo was given by a mutual friend in 1999 who called him Neo because he could 'see' music akin to the character Neo from The Matrix trilogy. He altered the '-yo' part as an homage to his hip hop roots.

During the same week, Ne-Yo's second single ""So Sick"" (produced by Stargate) reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Ne-Yo is as famous for his songwriting as for his singing, writing such songs as Rihanna's top ten hit ""Unfaithful"", Mario's ""Let Me Love You"", Mario Vazquez's ""Gallery"", Paula DeAnda's ""Walk Away (Remember Me)"", and Beyoncé's Billboard Hot 100 ten-week number-one hit ""Irreplaceable"".

His second album, Because of You, was released May 1, 2007. The first single from the platinum-selling album was ""Because of You"". He has also said that he has written songs for Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, Britney Spears, Corbin Bleu, and Enrique Iglesias for their upcoming albums. Smith also has stated that he will write songs for Craig David, Usher, Chris Brown, Jennifer Hudson, Leona Lewis, and he recently confirmed that he has been contacted by producer will.i.am to work on Michael Jackson's upcoming album.

He appeared in the song ""Deewangi Deewangi"" in the Hindi movie Om Shanti Om.

In February 2008 at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards, Ne-Yo won Best Contemporary R&B Album for  Because Of You.

The Lazy Love Songfacts reports that Ne-Yo's fifth studio album was originally titled 'The Cracks in Mr. Perfect' before Ne-Yo changed it to R.E.D, which stands for ""Realising Every Dream"".

 She has won 7 Grammy Awards. The RIAA named Braxton as one of the top selling R&B artists of all time.

She first burst onto the scene in 1992 on the Boomerang soundtrack, after Anita Baker turned down the opportunity. In 1993 Toni released her self-titled debut album, which stayed at the top of the charts for a year and was a critically acclaimed album.

Toni released her sophomore effort, Secrets in 1996 which also did very well on both R&B and Pop charts. From that album Toni got two #1 hits; ""You're Making Me High ""and ""Unbreak My Heart"", which spent 14 consecutive weeks at #1 on the Billboard top 100, and was a worldwide hit. After 5 Grammy awards and a little break, Toni Braxton came back strong with her 2000 album The Heat. Though not as successful as her first two albums,   The Heat   went on to sell 4 million copies and spawned the huge hits ""He Wasn't Man Enough""and ""Just Be A Man About It"".

Toni has released two further albums, 2002's More Than a Woman and 2005's Libra. Toni's sixth studio album Pulse was released in May 2010 via Atlantic Records.

In January 2011, the WE Television Network confirmed that it had signed Toni and the rest of the Braxton family for a reality series, Braxton Family Values, which will be marketed as one of the network's flagship shows. The series debuted April 12, 2011, and looks at the relationship between Toni, her mother, and her four sisters; Trina, Tamar, Traci and Towanda — all aspiring singers themselves — along with the interpersonal relationships of each family member. The show also looked at Braxton's heavily publicized separation from estranged husband, singer Keri Lewis. Toni parted ways with her long time manager Vincent Herbert (who was also the husband of sister Tamar Braxton at the time), and signed a new management deal with Los Angeles-based entertainment/production company 'The Collective'.

In 2014, Toni released a collaborative album with Babyface entitled Love, Marriage & Divorce; primarily inspired by their individual divorces (Toni with Keri, and Babyface with Tracey Edmonds). The album was supported by the singles ""Hurt You"", ""Where Did We Go Wrong"" and ""Roller Coaster""; and won Best R&B Album in the 57th Annual Grammy Awards (2015).

Toni's long-awaited eighth album Sex & Cigarettes was released on Def Jam in March 2018, which was supported by the singles ""Deadwood"", ""Long as I Live"" and ""FOH"". The album also featured a sole guest appearance from singer Colbie Caillat, and was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Best R&B Album in the 61st awards ceremony (2019).

271,271,eddy de pretto,64202,1618226,"Eddy de Pretto naît le 2 mai 1993 et grandit à Créteil, dans le Val-de-Marne, aux côtés de son père, chauffeur de poids-lourd et fan de football, et de sa mère, technicienne de laboratoire « passionnée de culture », d'origine réunionnaise. La ville natale à laquelle fait référence sa chanson Beaulieue et à laquelle il doit beaucoup, lui a donné « une certaine rage, une envie de me dépasser. Il y a un peu ce truc de carcan en banlieue, qu'on le veuille ou non : on nous dit qu'on est en marge, qu'on va arriver à rien, qu'on va mal finir. Moi j'avais des rêves plein la tête et une petite voix me disait que j'allais y arriver. L'envie de m'en sortir m'a aidé à y parvenir », raconte-t-il dans une interview.

À l’âge de douze ans, il commence à prendre des cours de théâtre, de chant, de technique vocale et de piano : « Je prenais la télécommande pour faire un micro et je tournais l’halogène pour faire la lumière. Du coup ma mère m’a proposé de prendre des cours de théâtre vu que je n’excellais pas au sport». Il poursuit sa formation à l'Institut supérieur des arts de la scène (ECM-ISAS), à Paris.

Eddy de Pretto fait ses premiers pas d'acteur en commençant par la publicité télévisée, notamment dans le rôle du jeune Jules César pour CanalSat en septembre 201010,11, avant d'entamer dans le monde théâtral et celui de cinématographique : les courts métrages Königsberg de Philipp Mayrhofer en 2012 et Vivre sa vie de Paul D. Meyer en 2013 ainsi qu'une apparition dans le long métrage Paulette (2013) de Jérôme Enrico.

Entre dix-huit et dix-neuf ans, il commence à écrire ses chansons. Il chante la première fois I Believe I Can Fly de R. Kelly devant le public de la Maison des jeunes et de la culture (MJC) de son quartier : « J’étais tout frêle, […] tellement stressé parce qu’il y avait beaucoup de rap et je n’étais pas du tout dans ces codes-là », raconte-t-il dans une interview.

Il participe au Printemps de Bourges, dont il remporte le prix des Inouïs, et à Bars en Trans, et est lauréat des inRocKs Lab 20162. Il se joint également en octobre 2017 au Festival Off Off Off des Nuits de Champagne à Troyes.

Kid et Cure
Il sort son premier EP, intitulé Kid, le 6 octobre 2017. Pour les lives de son EP, il lance les morceaux depuis son iPhone relié à un câble, il n’a pas de musicien excepté un batteur lors de ses concerts.

Début janvier 2018, sur la scène de l'émission de télévision Taratata, il chante Comme un boomerang en duo avec Julien Doré, jadis interprétée par Dani et Étienne Daho15 en 2001.

À la mi-janvier 2018 il lance Random, la première chanson de son futur premier album Cure16, évoquant ses peines de cœur16.

Aux côtés de Gaël Faye et Fishbach, il est nommé dans la catégorie « Révélation scène de l’année » à la 33e cérémonie des Victoires de la musique qui se déroule le 9 février 201817,16,18 : Gaël Faye en est le vainqueur.

Mi-février 2018, il présente son titre Ego sur « une instrumentale épurée et mécanique » et à propos duquel l’interprète s’explique : « Je pose l’éventualité de devenir dingue à cause de la vitesse à laquelle va le projet. À force d'entendre des éloges, le « trop de soi » implose, et c'est le risque que j’expose ici. La peur simple de tomber dans le fanatisme de soi-même par les réseaux sociaux, les mots d'amour, et tout autre signe qui flatte et qui crée ce monstre d'ego. »

Le 2 mars 2018, il sort son premier album Cure, disponible en CD, vinyle et en version dématérialisée. En même temps se révèle le clip de Normal abordant stéréotypes sur l'identité sexuelle, peur d'autrui et homophobie : « Une colère vis-à-vis de gens qui m’attaquaient parce qu'ils n’aimaient pas la personne que je pouvais représenter », explique-t-il dans le magazine Têtu. Le clip est tourné au centre des YMCA, rue de Trévise à Paris dans la plus vielle salle de basket-ball au monde[réf. nécessaire].

Giving bittersweet gems that explore the journey of personal experience, Mokita deliver the intimacy and desire sorely needed in music. Having collaborated with acclaimed producer Mike Nielsen (Jamiroquai, Underworld) and had two tracks 'Made of Stone' and 'Two Words' selected as Record of The Day the music industry's unofficial tastemaker, Mokita was No1. on the Indiestore download chart as well as becoming a published Artist/Songwriter. www.mokitamusic.com

2) Mokita were a four-piece band from London.

273,273,c.c. catch,173320,2211473,"Caroline Catharina Müller (born July 31, 1964), known as C.C.Catch, is a German pop singer and composer.

Caroline was born in Oss (the Netherlands). She moved with her family to Germany in the late 1970s. In 1980 she was a member of the girl quartet ""Optimal"". After that (starting in 1985) she cooperated with Dieter Bohlen under the name C.C.Catch.

Dieter Bohlen was the driving force behind her records, writing and producing all the songs. This was the main reason for the ending of their collaboration in 1989. Caroline wanted to participate in the creative process by contributing her own material, but Dieter did not agree.
Her biggest hits are ""I Can Lose My Heart Tonight"", "" Cause you are young"", ""Heartbreak Hotel"" all released in 1985 proved to be major hits in mainland Europe.

Müller went on to have Gold and Platinum selling albums and gain a sizable fanbase. The Caroline Müller and Dieter Bohlen partnership became to wane by the late 1980s. Müller wanted to participate in the creative process by contributing her own material, but Bohlen did not agree. This led to the split between singer and producer in 1989. The same year she recorded in England an album Hear What I Say, partially produced by Andy Taylor of Duran Duran.Produced in London by Andy Taylor, Dave Clayton and Joe Dworniak, it was markedly different in style from her previous releases and contained seven songs co-written by the artist herself.

The album was only a moderate success, possibly because the public had a hard time accepting her drastic change of style. C.C. Catch's former label Hansa might have also contributed to that situation, by simultaneously issuing a compilation of her Bohlen-produced hits. Subsequently C.C. Catch retired from the music business, became interested in meditation and married a yoga teacher in London.

She made her return in 1999 with regular successful concerts and touring. She finally released her new single, ""Silence"", written by Müller herself, in 2004. ""Silence"" became a moderate hit. It just missed the Top 40 of the German Pop chart, peaking at #47. She has continued her career, but with moderate success. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/C.C.+Catch"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

0,0,kendrick lamar,4292683,764328399,"Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper. Regarded as one of the most influential hip-hop artists of his generation, and one of the greatest rappers of all time, he was awarded the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music, becoming the first musician outside of the classical and jazz genres to receive the honor.

Born in Compton, California, Lamar began releasing music under the stage name K.Dot while attending high school. He signed with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) in 2005, and co-founded the hip hop supergroup Black Hippy there. Following the 2011 release of his alternative rap debut album Section.80, Lamar secured a joint contract with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. He rose to fame with his gangsta rap-influenced second album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012), which became the longest-charting hip hop studio album in Billboard 200's chart history. In 2015, Lamar scored his first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, after featuring on the remix of Taylor Swift's ""Bad Blood"", and released his third album, To Pimp a Butterfly, which infused hip-hop with historical African-American music genres such as jazz, funk, and soul, and became his first of five consecutive number-one albums on the Billboard 200 chart.

Lamar's critical and commercial success continued with his R&B and pop-leaning fourth album Damn (2017), yielding his second US number-one single, ""Humble"". He curated original songs for the soundtrack of the 2018 film Black Panther, earning a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the US top-ten single ""All the Stars"". Lamar's 2022 double album Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers concluded his tenure with TDE and Aftermath. His feud with Drake and subsequent sixth album GNX (2024) spawned the Hot 100 number-ones ""Like That"" and ""Squabble Up"", as well as ""Not Like Us"", which became the most-awarded song in the Grammy Awards history, with five wins, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year.

Lamar has received various accolades, including 22 Grammy Awards (the third-most won by a rapper), a Primetime Emmy Award, a Brit Award, 4 American Music Awards, 7 Billboard Music Awards, 11 MTV Video Music Awards (including 2 Video of the Year wins), and a record 37 BET Hip Hop Awards. Time listed him as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016. Three of his works were included in Rolling Stone's 2020 revision of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Outside of music, Lamar co-founded the creative company PGLang and ventured into film with his longtime creative partner, Dave Free. 

Kendrick Lamar Duckworth was born on June 17, 1987, in Compton, California. He is the first child of former gang hustler Kenneth ""Kenny"" Duckworth and hairdresser Paula Oliver. Both of his parents are African Americans from the South Side of Chicago. When they were teenagers, they relocated to Compton in 1984, due to his father's affiliation with the Gangster Disciples. Lamar was named after singer-songwriter Eddie Kendricks of the Temptations. He was an only child until the age of seven and was described as a loner by his mother. Eventually, his parents had his two younger brothers and younger sister, businesswoman Kayla Sawyer (née Duckworth). His cousins include basketball player Nick Young and rapper Baby Keem. He considered studying psychology and astronomy in college, but suspended his academic pursuits to focus on his music career.

Tupac Shakur is Lamar's biggest influence, having impacted both his professional and personal lives. One of his earliest childhood memories is watching him and Dr. Dre film the second music video for their single ""California Love"" with his father at the Compton Swap Meet. Lamar has described himself as an ""offspring"" of Shakur's artistry and sociopolitical views. Although some publications have regarded him as the Shakur of his generation, he has strived to maintain his individuality.

Lamar maintains a low public profile, and is known to be reserved. He is reluctant to publicly discuss his personal life and generally avoids using social media. He is also decisive when engaging with mainstream media outlets, although journalists have complimented his ""Zen-like"" calmness and down to earth personality. According to Lamar, he has become ""so invested in who I am outside of being famous, sometimes that's all I know. I've always been a person that really didn't dive too headfirst into wanting and needing attention. I mean, we all love attention, but for me, I don't necessarily adore it."" His lyrics have been a topic of media scrutiny, leading to both praise and controversy.

Lamar's public perception has also been influenced by the various rap feuds he has been involved with. Although some journalists declared him the winner of his highly publicized conflict with Drake, some felt that his victory was pyrrhic due to the severity of accusations introduced and the spread of online misinformation. Following the release of Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, media outlets have described Lamar as the ""modern hip hop messiah"". Some critics dislike his ""grating"" political infusions, causing him to be viewed as having a savior complex. However, Lamar has declared himself to be the ""greatest rapper alive"" due to his personal connection to hip hop. ""I'm not doing it to have a good song, or one good rap, or a good hook, or a good bridge,"" he explained to Zane Lowe. ""I want to keep doing it every time, period. And to do it every time, you have to challenge yourself and you have to confirm to yourself—not anybody else, confirm to yourself that you're the best, period. [...] That's my drive and that's my hunger, I will always have"".

In November 2024, Kendrick Lamar released his sixth studio album, GNX, marking his first project after departing from Top Dawg Entertainment and Aftermath Entertainment. The album features collaborations with artists such as SZA, Roddy Ricch, and emerging Los Angeles rappers, and includes production contributions from Jack Antonoff. GNX blends elements reminiscent of his previous works, combining mainstream appeal with complex themes, and introduces new influences like the West Coast club sound. The album's release intensified Lamar's ongoing feud with Drake, particularly with the track ""Not Like Us,"" which became a massive hit and won multiple Grammy awards. Following his performance at the Super Bowl Halftime Show in 2025, GNX returned to the top of the Billboard 200 chart, solidifying Lamar's status as a dominant force in contemporary hip-hop. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

3,3,6ix9ine,934037,24762989,"Daniel Hernandez (born May 8, 1996) professionally known as 6ix9ine or Tekashi69, is a Mexican-American rapper who is based in Brooklyn. Hernandez is known for his distinctive rainbow-themed look, tattoos, aggressive style of rapping, public feuds with fellow celebrities, legal issues, and controversial public persona.

Hernandez rose to mainstream fame in late 2017 with the release of his debut single ""Gummo"", which was certified platinum by the RIAA. In early 2018, Hernandez released his debut mixtape, Day69, which debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 album chart. He later earned his first top-five entry on the Billboard Hot 100 with ""Fefe"", featuring Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz, which peaked at number three on the chart. His debut studio album, Dummy Boy, was released on November 27, 2018, after being delayed a week earlier due to his arrest, and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. 

Hernandez pled guilty to using a 13-year-old child in a sexual performance in 2015. He was arrested in November 2018 on racketeering and firearm charges, among others, for which he is facing a possible life sentence in federal prison.

Early Life
He was raised with his older brother by his parents until he was 13, when his father was shot dead steps away from the family home. Emotionally disturbed by the death of his father, Hernandez started to act out and was eventually expelled from school in the 8th grade for bad behavior. Rather than continue his education, he started working various odd jobs such as working as a busboy to help his mother financially. Hernandez also dealt drugs to supplement his income, most notably selling cannabis and heroin on the streets while working at a local Brooklyn bodega. He was eventually arrested for his criminal activities and sentenced to prison time at Rikers Island, where he began to associate himself with the Nine Trey Gangsters, a prison subset of the Bloods street gang. Hernandez began his career as a rapper in 2014, releasing songs such as ""69"" and ""Scumlife"". Other early songs were taken down by YouTube.

Career
Hernandez began releasing rap songs in 2014. Over the next three years, he released multiple tracks and videos with titles such as ""Scumlife"", ""Yokai"", and ""Hellsing Station"", drawing attention for his aggressive rapping style and use of anime as music video visuals. Many of his early songs were released by FCK THEM, a music label based in Slovakia. Gathering fame as an internet meme for his rainbow-dyed hair and rainbow-plated grills, he eventually became an associate of fellow New York rapper ZillaKami. They later feuded after Hernandez allegedly stole instrumentals and songs they had made together.

Hernandez's commercial debut single ""Gummo"" was released on November 10, 2017, and eventually peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was certified platinum by the RIAA on March 5, 2018. His next single, ""Kooda"", debuted at number 61 on the Hot 100 the week of December 23, 2017. On January 14, 2018, Hernandez released his third single, ""Keke"", with Fetty Wap and A Boogie wit da Hoodie, which also charted on the Hot 100.

Shortly afterward, Hernandez announced his debut mixtape, titled Day69. The mixtape was released on February 23, 2018, and debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 album chart with 55,000 album-equivalent units, of which 20,000 were pure sales. According to Jon Caramanica of The New York Times, the tape was an outgrowth of the ""SoundCloud rap explosion"", and was notable for its willingness to deviate from hip-hop's prevailing sound. After the release of Day69, two songs from the album, ""Billy"" and ""Rondo"" both debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, with ""Billy"" peaking at number 50 and ""Rondo"" at number 73.

In April 2018, Hernandez released ""Gotti"", a remix of a feature he did for artist Packman titled ""Got it, Got it"". The song's video was released on April 16, 2018, and involved footage of Hernandez donating bundles of $100 bills to poor citizens in the Dominican Republic. The song was added to Day69 as a deluxe song and debuted at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 before dropping off the following week, making it his sixth consecutive Hot 100 entry.

Hernandez stirred up controversy in May 2018 when he was involved in a shooting with the entourage of fellow New York rapper Casanova as part of a feud; this led to Hernandez losing a $5 million headphone deal and being banned from the Barclays Center. After the shooting, Hernandez stopped releasing music for several months, before releasing ""Tati"", featuring DJ Spinking in June, which debuted at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100.

In July 2018, Hernandez released his eighth single, ""Fefe"", featuring Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz; the single debuted at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 before peaking at number three in its second week, marking 6ix9ine's highest entry on the chart and his first single to reach the top five of the Hot 100. ""Fefe"" was later certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. His subsequent singles, ""Bebe"" and ""Stoopid"", also reached the top 30 of the Hot 100.

In early October 2018, Hernandez was featured on the song ""Aulos Reloaded"" with French house DJ Vladimir Cauchemar and ""Kick"" with Danish singer Jimilian.

On November 7, 2018, it was announced that his debut studio album, Dummy Boy, was to be released on November 23, but on November 21, it was announced that the album would be postponed. The album was ultimately released without notice on November 27, on all streaming services. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/6ix9ine"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

4,4,drake,5937684,835585752,"Aubrey ""Drake"" Graham (born October 24, 1986) is an Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and businessman. Drake was an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s. Intent on pursuing a career in music, he left the series in 2007 after releasing his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.

Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum. His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same, were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late and collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of which earned platinum certification in the U.S. His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records. The dancehall-influenced album sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over 10 years. The album's second single, ""One Dance"", topped the charts in several countries, and became his first number-one single as a lead artist. That year, Drake led both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts simultaneously for eight weeks.

Views achieved quadruple platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. It became Drake's best-selling album to date. Its lead single ""Hotline Bling"" peaked at number two on the Hot 100 and received Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song, as well as ""One Dance"" which was proclaimed the song of the summer in 2016. In 2017, he released the ""playlist"" More Life. It became his seventh consecutive number one on the Billboard 200, and set multiple streaming records. A year later, he released the double album Scorpion, which also broke several streaming records, and contains the Grammy Award winning number-one single ""God's Plan"", and the bounce-infused number one singles ""Nice for What"" and ""In My Feelings"".

Among the world's best-selling music artists, with over 170 million records sold worldwide, he is ranked by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) as the world's highest-certified digital singles artist. Drake holds several Billboard chart records. He has the most charted songs (205) among solo artists in the history of the Billboard Hot 100, the most simultaneously charted Hot 100 songs in a single week (27), the most time on the Hot 100 (431 weeks) and the most Hot 100 debuts in a week (22). He also has the most number one singles on the Hot Rap Songs, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay and Rhythmic Charts. Drake has also won four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, twenty-seven Billboard Music Awards and three Juno Awards. As an entrepreneur, Drake has founded the OVO Sound record label with longtime collaborator 40 in 2012.

Early life
Drake attended both Forest Hill Collegiate Institute (left) and Vaughan Road Academy (right) during high school.
Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practicing Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Drake's mother, Sandra ""Sandi"" Graham (née Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. His parents met after Dennis performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he first interacted with Sandra, who was in attendance. He is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day school, and formally celebrated becoming a Bar Mitzvah in a religious service.

Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Dennis' limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the United States until Drake's early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, however, Dennis would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer. His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song titled ""Drake's Dad"". Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell records, which Drake vehemently denies.

Drake was raised in two Toronto neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end until grade six, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighborhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move, Drake replied, ""[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement; my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.""

He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school. He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighborhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighborhood, Drake described the school as ""not by any means the easiest school to go to."" Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background, and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school. He later graduated in October 2012.

Career - 2001–2005: Degrassi: The Next Generation
At 15, eager to begin as an actor, a high school friend introduced Drake to his father, who was an acting agent. The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks a basketball star who became physically disabled after a classmate shot him. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, ""My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV"". He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, returning for sporadic appearances until his character graduated from school. Overall, Drake appeared in a total of 145 episodes.

2006–2009: Early mixtapes and So Far Gone
Lil Wayne, the founder of Young Money Entertainment, would sign Drake to the label in 2009.
After becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as ""pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it."" The mixtape was released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies. In 2007, he released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single ""Replacement Girl"", featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever-unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with ""Replacement Girl"" being featured on the channel's ""New Joint of the Day"" segment on April 30, 2007. The song also saw Drake sample ""Man of the Year"" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including ""Ransom"", ""Forever"", and a remix to ""Brand New"". Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.

In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles ""Best I Ever Had"" and ""Successful"", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs ""I'm Goin' In"" and ""Fear"". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.

Due to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as ""one of the biggest bidding wars ever"". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album titled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means.

Drake then joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of ""Best I Ever Had"" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He underwent surgery later that year.

2010–2012: Thank Me Later and Take Care
Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.

On March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single ""Over"", which peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, ""Find Your Love"", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[76] The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, ""]Care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image]."" The third single and fourth singles, ""Miss Me"" and ""Fancy"" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.

Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.

It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire on May 8, and he had also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.

Beginning his second effort in fall 2010, Drake announced his intentions to allow for Noah ""40"" Shebib to handle most of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me Later, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and others. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be Take Care. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, ""I didn't get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed many of the songs and sonically I didn't get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round."" Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.

In January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie, to focus on the album. ""Dreams Money Can Buy"" and ""Marvins Room"" were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track listing, while ""Marvins Room"" gained Gold certification by the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio. Drake would soon release the song's music video on June 28.

""Headlines"" was released on August 9, acting as the lead single for Take Care. It was met with positive critical and commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12. It was eventually certified Platinum in both the United States and Canada. The music video for the single was released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game in January 2012. ""Make Me Proud"" was released as the album's second single, on October 16. It was the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number nine the following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88. ""Make Me Proud"" soon became Drake's fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.

Prior to the album's release, Drake had planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne, however, it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne. He had also begun collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled Y.O.L.O., but the duo decided against the project, in favor of increased concern for their respective studio albums.

Take Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. John McDonnell of NME dubbed it ""an affecting masterpiece"" and commended its ""delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive lyrics."" Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal found Drake's ""technical abilities"" to be improved and stated, ""Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up."" Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice called it ""a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West."" Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented the depth of Drake's ""moral psychodramas"" and stated, ""the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying power."" It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial success, eventually being certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the US.

The album's third and fourth singles, ""The Motto"" and Take Care"", were released on November 29, and February 21, 2012 respectively. Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with ""The Motto"" credited for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States. The music video for ""Take Care"" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, ""None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] - make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it."" The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year. The song was also featured on the channel's ""Pop Songs You Must Hear"" list of 2011. ""HYFR"" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified Gold. It would later win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video in 2012, and the channel also ranked him at number two on their ""Hottest MCs in the Game"" list.

In promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip-hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million. He then returned to acting, starring in Ice Age: Continental Drift as Ethan.

2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and commercial mixtapes
During the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer's influence over his next album. Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics prevalent previously.

In January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off of his third album at the conclusion of the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of his third album. The album's second single, ""Hold On, We're Going Home"", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful single off of the album, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song's music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the video. Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing the album's third single, ""Too Much"", alongside featured artist Sampha.

Nothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favorable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in 808s & Heartbreak. The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further promoted by the ""Would You like a Tour?"" throughout late 2013, to early 2014. It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million. Drake then returned to acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night Live, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what ""kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters"". Drake also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city. In late 2014, Drake announced that he had begun recording sessions for his fourth studio album.

In 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the Romeo Santos song Odio. He also appeared on a remix of Tuesday by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard's Rhythmic chart and number twelve on the ""Hot 100"", and released ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"" as a non-album single. The latter went double platinum in the United States.

On February 12, 2015, Drake released If You're Reading This It's Too Late onto iTunes, with no prior announcement. Despite debate on whether it is an album or a mixtape, its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money Records, a scheme that was rumored to allow Drake to leave the label. However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and If You're Reading This It's Too Late sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall. Drake proceeded If You're Reading This It's Too Late with a collaborative mixtape with Future, which was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week.

What a Time to Be Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Drake the first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the same year since 2004. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units. Drake also appeared on the cover of The Fader for their 100th issue.

2016–2017: Views and More Life
Drake announced in January 2016 that his fourth studio album would be launched during the spring, releasing the promotional single ""Summer Sixteen"" later that month. The album was originally titled Views from the six, but would later be shortened to Views. ""Summer Sixteen"" debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip-hop to more tenured artists. This move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as ""goodly brash"" or ""conventionally disrespectful."" It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake popularizing the term ""The Six"" when referencing Toronto. Drake also crashed a Bat Mitzvah in New York City on February 20, performing at the event.

Drake soon released the album's lead singles, ""Pop Style"" and the dancehall-infused ""One Dance"", on April 5. Both debuted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with ""One Dance"" becoming Drake's first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist. The single also became Drake's first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed the album's release date of April 29, and followed it up with various promotional videos. On October 15, ""One Dance"" became Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016.

Views was previewed in London, before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being made available to various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later to release a short film titled Please Forgive Me, starring frequent collaborators, Swedish twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta. As of 2019, Views remains Drake's best-selling album.

Drake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as the show's musical guest. Later, Drake was named as a member of the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury. During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the music video for ""Child's Play"" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics. On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views. At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Drake received the most nominations, with 10, winning the awards for Album of the Year and Best Hip-Hop Video. Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the course of the tour in Europe. Seven additional dates were added a day later due to overwhelming demands.

Soon after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed he would be releasing a project titled More Life in December, however he later pushed the date back to the new year. The project was described as a ""playlist of original music"", rather than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album. He was later revealed to be Spotify's most streamed artist for the second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion streams for all projects on the service, which is more than double the amount of streams he had in 2015. Drake later secured his second and third Grammy Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony. Despite multiple setbacks, Drake announced More Life would be released on March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials released through Instagram. Upon release, More Life received mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200, earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It also set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever streamed album in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music alone. The album also garnered 61.3 million streams on Spotify, dethroning Ed Sheeran's ÷ as the highest opening on the service in a single day. He later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins in a single show. Billboard also reported Drake had been present on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has the most recorded entries by a solo artist.

He then released the single ""Signs"" on June 24, as well as reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset. The singles marked his first releases since More Life, with ""Signs"" was initially released as a collaboration between Drake and French fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the ""Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2018"" fashion show. The event also had a playlist exclusively from OVO Sound, curated by label co-founder Oliver El-Khatib. Drake later hosted the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of Virginia Black. Drake then appeared in The Carter Effect documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince Carter, who was the first superstar player to appear for the Toronto Raptors since the franchise's inception in 1995. The documentary also featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and LeBron James.

2018: Scorpion and return to television
After rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer Pi'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017. Two songs would later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on January 20, 2018, marking Drake's first solo release since More Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring on a remix of the Jay-Z song ""Family Feud"" with Lil Wayne, as the lead single of the latter's Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape. Scary Hours featured the songs ""Diplomatic Immunity"" and ""God's Plan"", which both debuted within the top-ten, with the latter eventually breaking various streaming records as it debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was Drake's second as a solo artist to reach number one.

Drake earned his 70th top 40 hit after featuring on the Migos song ""Walk It Talk It"", which debuted at number eighteen, and peaked at number ten. He later featured on BlocBoy JB's debut single, ""Look Alive"", which was released on February 9, 2018. The song's entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper with the top 10 hits on the Hot 100, with 23. He then featured on a remix to ""Lemon"", a song originally released as collaboration between band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, Drake announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was releasing a single later that night. On April 6, ""Nice for What"" was released, alongside a music video, which featured several female celebrities.

After ""Nice For What"" replaced his own ""God's Plan"" on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace their former number-one debut, Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion, with a planned release date of June 29, 2018. He then released ""I'm Upset"" on May 26, as the album's third single. Scorpion was then released as a double-album, and marked Drake's longest project, with a run-time of just under 90 minutes. The album broke both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it gained 132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming service, respectively. It eventually sold 749,000 album equivalent units in its first week of sales, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.

Shortly thereafter, Drake collaborated with British hip hop promotion Link Up TV on July 7, releasing a freestyle as a part of the promotion's 'Behind Barz' segment, before releasing another freestyle a week later after featuring on Charlie Sloth's long-running Fire in the Booth program on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Drake then earned his sixth number-one hit with ""In My Feelings"" on July 21, which also spawned the viral ""#InMyFeelingsChallenge"" or ""#KiKiChallenge"". The success of ""In My Feelings"" also made Drake the record holder for most number one hits among rappers. Soon after, he released the music video for ""Nonstop"", which was filmed in London during his surprise performance at the Wireless Festival.

He then appeared on the album Astroworld, featuring uncredited vocals for the song ""Sicko Mode"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Drake announced in July 2018 that he planned to ""take 6 months to a year"" to himself in order to produce television and films, including Euphoria. He then began the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour with co-headliners Migos on August 12. This preceded collaboration with Bad Bunny titled ""Mia"", which featured Drake performing in Spanish. He later received the award for Hot Ticket Performer at the 2018 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 16. During a performance in Edmonton on November 7, Drake announced his intention to begin composing his next project in early 2019.

2019–present: Upcoming album
In February 2019, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rap Song, for ""God's Plan"", at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. During his speech, producers abruptly cut to a commercial break, leading viewers to speculate they were censoring his speech during which he criticized The Recording Academy. A legal representative for the Academy then released a statement stating ""a natural pause [led] the producers [to] assume that he was done and cut to commercial,"" and added the organization offered him an opportunity to return to stage, but he declined.

On February 14, Drake re-released his third mixtape, So Far Gone, onto streaming services for the first time to commemorate its 10-year anniversary, and later collaborated with Summer Walker on a remix of Walker's song ""Girls Need Love"", marking his first release of 2019. On April 10, 2019 during a London performance on his Assassination Vacation Tour, the OVO leader told the crowd he was working on his new album before the show. On June 8, Drake appeared on Chris Brown's single ""No Guidance"". On June 15, Drake released two songs, ""Omertà"" and ""Money in the Grave"", on his EP The Best in the World Pack to celebrate the NBA Championship win of the Toronto Raptors. On August 2, he released the compilation album Care Package, consisting of songs released between 2010 and 2016 that were initially unavailable for purchase or commercial streaming; it debuted at number one.

Artistry - influences
Drake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West, Jay Z, and Lil Wayne, while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah, and Usher. Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his ""biggest inspirations"".

Musical style
Drake has credited Kanye West (left) and Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical influences. Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism. His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as ""ting"", ""touching road"", ""talkin' boasy"" and ""gwanin' wassy"". Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip-hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing. He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.

The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional or boastful. However, Drake is often revered for incorporating ""degrading"" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between ""pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata."" Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as ""hyper-reality rap"", which is characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as being distinct from the ""real world.""

Public image
The Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States, with his single, ""The Motto"", which includes, ""You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO."" Drake later popularized the term ""The Six"" in 2015 in relation his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city. Furthermore, the subject matter of his artistry often revolving around relationships, have had widespread impact on social media through photo captions commonly used to reference emotions or personal situations. However, his lyrical contents have had a negative reception from fans and critics deeming him as sensitive; a trait that is understood as being antithetical to hip hop culture. June 10 was declared ""Drake Day"" in Houston, Texas. In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines, in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance. In 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States. He would also donate $200,000 in order to aid relief efforts in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey. In February 2018, following the single ""God's Plan"" debut at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Drake donated $50,000 to a Miami homeless shelter and giving a University of Miami student $50,000 to help with her tuition. Drake then ""kept up the spending spree"" by donating the rest of the song's video budget, $996,631.90, to several charitable causes and regular people across Miami.

The music video for ""Hotline Bling"" went viral, due to Drake's eccentric choices in dancing. The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake's unconventional nature on the song, causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, spawning several parodies. Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exampled by the video for ""Hotline Bling"". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6"" Classic Boots. This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose, in which various items of clothing were produced. Drake had also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the ""Air Jordan OVOs"". Moreover, his style and dress sense have caused GQ magazine to describe him as ""[one of] the most stylish men alive"".

Controversies - legal issues
In 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on ""Marvins Room"". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties. Despite Drake's legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling ""Jimmy Smith Rap"", a 1982 single by jazz musician, Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who stated Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on ""Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2"", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop. Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement. Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics on when collaborating with YG on the song ""Who Do You Love?"". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year. In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.

In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel ""Chubbs"" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also says the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering. The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu, after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference; the judge ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense.

Feuds
Drake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident and released a song criticizing Drake weeks later. Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute.

In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe magazine. Drake would later respond on ""6 God"" and ""6PM in New York"", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment.

Further controversy arose in July 2015, when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during recording sessions for ""RICO"", one of the lead singles off of Mill's second studio album. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller. Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for ""R.I.C.O."". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for ""R.I.C.O."", ""10 Bands"", and ""Know Yourself"". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, titled ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back"", in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with ""Wanna Know"", before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later. Despite subliminal disses from either artist, the feud has not been officially reignited. Drake would further seek to denounce Funkmaster Flex during his Madison Square Garden shows on the Summer Sixteen Tour. Following Meek Mill's sentencing of two to four years for probation violation, Drake stated ""Free Meek Mill"" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on ""Family Feud"". Pusha T would also use the same rationale to criticize Drake on ""Infrared"" in 2018, prompting Drake to respond with the ""Duppy Freestyle"" diss track on May 25. Pusha T would directly respond to the track through ""The Story of Adidon"" on May 29, which presented several claims, including an accusation of Drake fathering a secret child. The pair is considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, with Drake yet to respond to ""The Story of Adidon"".

In 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through ""4PM in Calabasas"", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on ""No Shopping"" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song. However, French Montana claimed that Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake, he has yet to officially respond to Budden. In the same year, Drake mocked Kid Cudi for his mental health, drug use and suicidal urges on ""Two Birds, One Stone"" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter. Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.

In mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator, Kanye West. In an appearance on the talk show The Shop in October, Drake recounted several business meetings with West, who voiced his desire to ""be Quincy Jones"" and work with him, in order to replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson. West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, which was agreed to as Drake ""felt a genuine vibe"" from West, and after West gifted him the beat to ""Lift Yourself"", which inspired Drake to begin writing to the instrumental. West then requested Drake to travel to Wyoming to continue working, and arrived a day after close friend 40. 40 said West was working on an album; contradictory to his previous aim of just wanting to ""give [Drake] beats"". Drake responded by saying West stated he would release in late 2018, and they should continue on. However, upon his arrival in Wyoming, Drake ""[spent] the majority of time working on [West's] music"", only exploring his own after playing the producer the song ""March 14"", which addresses Drake's relationship with his newborn son and co-parent. This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T. West would also release ""Lift Yourself"", and produce ""Infrared""; actions that greatly displeased Drake. This prompted him to denounce West in several songs and live performances. West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018.

Drake has purported to have been in reported feuds with DMX, Kendrick Lamar, Common, The Weeknd, XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez, and Ludacris, although the latter three have been reported to be resolved.

Business ventures - Endorsements
Prior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient. In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger King and Whataburger. Business magazine Forbes commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships ""combined heavily"" for Drake's reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the highest-paid celebrities during that period.

Main article: OVO Sound
During the composition of Nothing Was the Same, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, and business partner, Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the trio to team up to form OVO Sound. The name is an abbreviation derived from the October's Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects. Warner Bros. Records currently distribute the label.

Drake, 40 and PartyNextDoor were the label's inaugural artists. The label houses artists including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, OB O'Brien, Roy Woods, dvsn, Plaza, and Kash Doll, as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Mike Zombie, Nineteen85, and Future the Prince. OVO Sound has released six albums, with two certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Toronto Raptors
On September 30, 2013, at a press conference with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke, Drake was announced as the new ""global ambassador"" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. This would also be the setting where Drake was given The Key to the City. In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities, beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary. He began by hosting an annual ""Drake Night"" segment with the organization, which began in 2013.

Apple Music
Following the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million. This saw all future solo releases by Drake becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers. Drake had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted More Life. Drake's partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform's sharp success, as it attained 10 million subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists, such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services. Through signing with the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before the smartwatch saw public release.

Virginia Black
Two months prior to the release of Views, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based whiskey. This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring's Restaurant in Toronto. The beverage was created and also distributed alongside Proximo Spirits, as well as with Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008. The company described the partnership as ""fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey.""

The product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically. The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music and various tours, such as being part of the ""Virginia Black VIP Lounge"" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016. The company later aired commercials with Dennis Graham, which featured the tagline of ""The Realest Dude Ever"" (in reference toward ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to various European countries in 2017.

Personal life
Drake lives in Hidden Hills, California, since 2012. He also owns a property in Toronto, which was built from the ground-up in 2017, and a Toronto condo adjacent to the CN Tower. He owns a Boeing 767 airplane.

Drake's paternal uncles are bass guitarist Larry Graham and musician Teenie Hodges. Graham achieved both critical and commercial success as a member of the band Sly and the Family Stone, while Hodges featured as the lead guitarist and songwriter for Al Green, and contributed heavily on much of his work in the 1970s, including the hits ""Take Me to the River"", ""Love and Happiness"", and ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"".

Drake is a father to one son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French artist Sophie Brussaux. Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumors after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017; Drake eventually confirmed his fatherhood on the album Scorpion in 2018.

Drake dated singer Rihanna off-and-on from 2009 to 2016. He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums, and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said ""she's a woman I've been in love with since I was 22 years old."" On becoming a single parent, he mused on the talk show The Shop:

As life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don't have the fairy tale, like, 'Oh, Drake started a family with Rihanna and this is like so perfect.' It looks so good on paper. By the way, I wanted that too at one time.

15,15,natti natasha,306648,4361358,"Natalia Alexandra Gutiérrez, known by her stage name Natti Natasha, is a Dominican reggaeton singer, songwriter, and actress. Hailing from Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Natasha grew up surrounded by endless musical influences and enrolled in Santiago’s School of Fine Arts at the age of seven where she developed her singing abilities, describing her time at the school as “one of the best of her life.” Her studio experience would begin as a teenager when she would record songs as a hobby and later alongside friends.

This all led up to her decision to make the biggest and riskiest move of her life, and that was to move to the United States. She settled in the Bronx, New York, or “the City of the Dreams and Dreamers” for young, aspiring musicians like her at the time. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Natti called the move “one of the craziest moves anyone ever did in her family,” and that she often looks back at the decision and wonders what she was doing. Natti would hop from studio to studio, working without pay, but to her, this was a way to get her name out there. A producer friend from Santiago would soon step in and lend her his New York studio.

Natti’s first-ever break came when icon Don Omar signed her to his record label, the Orfanato Music Group, and the pair would go on to make history for years to come. Their collaborations “Dutty Love,” “Tus Movimientos,” “Perdido en tus Ojos,” and a “Hold Ya” remix with Gyptian made waves across Latin America and introduced the world to future reggaeton royalty. Her debut project, an EP titled “All About Me” was released on March 28, 2012.

Natti would continue to make big career moves throughout the years including her departure from Don Omar’s record label and signing onto Pina Records in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2017 when her big breakout would come once and for all. Not only did she record and release a collaboration titled “Otra Cosa” alongside the legendary Daddy Yankee, but she also released what was arguably the biggest song of 2017. “Criminal” featuring Ozuna became an instant hit upon its release, the music video amassing over 1 billion views in just five months and becoming the most watched music video by a female singer released that year.

2019 saw the release of her much-anticipated debut album, “ilumiNATTI,” on February 15. 15 tracks made up the project with two collaborations in total, “Te Lo Dije'' with Anitta and “Soy Mía” with Kany García. Standout track “La Mejor Version de Mi” would transform into a bachata hit with its remix featuring bachata king Romeo Santos.

Natti’s sophomore album titled “NATTIVIDAD” would be released two years later on September 24, 2021 with 17 tracks featuring several chart-topping collaborators such as Becky G, Maluma, and Prince Royce. The release was followed up by the six-episode docuseries titled “Everybody Loves Natti” which documented her pregnancy and relationship with fiancé Raphy Pina. The series premiered on November 19, 2021 on Amazon Prime Video and was generally well received. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Natti+Natasha"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Austin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York. He was raised by his father, Richard Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip-hop, country, and rock. When Malone was nine years old, he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys. Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game Guitar Hero.

Malone has always had a love for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event. According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band. He says soon afterward he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip-hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.

According to Malone, he chose ""Post Malone"" as his stage name when he was 14 or 15. The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone, but Malone later explained that ""Post"" is his last name, and he used a ""rap name generator"" to get ""Malone"". At 16, using the audio editor Audacity, Malone created his first mixtape, Young and After Them Riches. He showed it to some of his classmates at Grapevine High School. He was voted ""Most Likely to Become Famous"" by his classmates as a senior in high school. He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.

Malone later enrolled in Tarrant County College but dropped out. After leaving college, Malone moved to Los Angeles, California, with his longtime friend Jason Probst, a professional game streamer.

After moving to Los Angeles, Malone, Probst, and several other producers and artists formed the music group BLCKVRD and recorded music together. Several members of the group, including Malone, moved into a house in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley together. While living in the San Fernando Valley, Malone met record producers FKi 1st and Sauce Lord Rich, who formed the production team FKi, as well as Rex Kudo, who produced several of Malone's tracks, including ""White Iverson"". Malone recorded the song two days after writing it. The lyrics of ""White Iverson"" allude to Basketball Hall of Fame player Allen Iverson. In February 2015, upon completion, it was uploaded to Malone's SoundCloud account. On July 19, 2015, Malone released a music video for ""White Iverson"".

After hitting one million views within a month of releasing ""White Iverson"", Malone quickly garnered attention from record labels.

In August 2015, he performed at Kylie Jenner's 18th birthday party, where he met Kanye West, who enjoyed his music, leading to him collaborating with Malone on his single ""Fade"" from his album The Life of Pablo. Malone later began a friendship with Canadian singer Justin Bieber leading to Malone being an opening act for Bieber's Purpose World Tour (2016–17). On April 20, 2016, Malone premiered his new single, ""Go Flex"" on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show.

In June 2016, XXL editor-in-chief Vanessa Satten revealed Malone was considered for XXL's ""2016 Freshman Class"" magazine cover, but she was ""told by his camp that he wasn't paying attention to hip hop so much. He was going in more of a rock/pop/country direction."" However, Malone denied these claims, explaining that his latest mixtape, as well as his album, were both hip-hop. In August 2016, Malone issued an apology for his album, Stoney, being late. It was available for pre-order on November 4 and was finally released on December 9. Malone later went on to call the album ""mediocre"", despite the success of the single ""Congratulations"" featuring Quavo, Malone's first top-ten song on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number eight. Stoney also featured the top 100 hits ""I Fall Apart"", and ""Deja Vu"", featuring Bieber, with the album later being certified double platinum by the RIAA in October 2017.

In February 2017, Malone revealed the title of his next project, beerbongs & bentleys, and was set to be released in December, before eventually being pushed back to 2018. In September, Malone released the first single from the album, ""Rockstar"", featuring 21 Savage.

21,21,lil peep,1714039,262600356,"Lil Peep (born Gustav Åhr) was an American recording artist hailing from Long Island, New York. He was cited as one of the primary artists responsible for the post-emo revival with his style of hip hop which came to be known as emo trap. After a slight delay, his debut album Come over When You're Sober, Pt. 1 was released on August 15, 2017. Due to a possible drug overdose, he passed away on November 15, 2017 (aged 21).

Lil Peep was described as a ""SoundCloud rapper"", and his musical style is considered lo-fi rap or emo-trap. The New York Times defined Åhr as the Kurt Cobain of lo-fi rap and described his music as gloomy and diabolically melodic. Åhr's music generally draws on both southern US rap and the angsty introspection of the rock subgenre post-hardcore.

In 2015, Åhr released his first mixtape, Lil Peep Part One, which generated 4,000 plays in its first week. Shortly thereafter, he released his first extended play, Feelz, and another mixtape, Live Forever. In 2016, Åhr released two seminal mixtapes, Crybaby and Hellboy. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/LIL+PEEP"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

22,22,matasvandals,6203,167833,
23,23,kaze,32313,925972,"There are several artists named Kaze:

1. A Free Jazz Group
2. A Japanese R&B pop vocalist
3. Kevin “Kaze” Thomas
4. A Spanish rapper

1. 
Natsuki Tamura – trumpet
Christian Pruvost - trumpet
Satoko Fujii – piano
Peter Orins– drums

Formed only seven months before their remarkable debut recording Rafale, Kaze brings together trumpeter Natsuki Tamura and pianist Satoko Fujii, two of Japan's foremost improviser-composers, with trumpeter Christian Pruvost and drummer Peter Orins from the French improvisers collective, Muzzix.
The members of this international quartet share an insatiable appetite for sonic experimentation, boundless energy and enthusiasm, and the disciplined intelligence of accomplished spontaneous composers. Melodic, abstract, mysterious, beautiful, and confrontational, Kaze plays free jazz at its most creative and powerful.

2. Kaze debuted as a solo artist from the record label D-topia with the digital single ""Zurukare"" in 2011, in addition to featuring on several compilation albums. 

3. Kevin “Kaze” Thomas is a versatile artist-producer who captures the spirit of groundbreakers like Run-DMC, Snoop Dog, and Wu-Tang Clan to promote an on-going, innovative hip-hop culture. Hailing from northern Virginia and eastern North Carolina, Kaze grew up in the 80’s memorizing his big sister’s mix tapes of hip-hop legends to lift himself out of an oppressive country lifestyle. As a student in communications at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, Kaze helped to create Hip-Hop Nation, an on-campus organization fostering the growth of local emcees, poets, DJs, dancers, and graffiti artists. His mission gained national attention in 2001 when Kaze was tapped to co-create, produce, and host the nationally syndicated television program titled Hip-Hop Nation: Notes from the Underground. The show captured the immensity of the culture’s influence with viewers in over a hundred markets and linked Kaze’s name with a movement of international interest.

Kaze’s production experiences led to the establishment of his own record label, Soul Dojo, Inc. The initial offering under that label is his Spirit of ’94, a tribute to the legends of hip-hop featuring 15 tracks he both wrote and produced. Ingenuity and originality characterize his rhymes, while his words promote political consciousness, address personal trials, and celebrate the passion of hip-hop. The March 2003 release of Spirit of ‘94 set the standard for the label, claiming much critical acclaim and winning fans across the state. After selling thousands of copies independently, both on the streets and through mom and pop record stores, Spirit of ’94 was picked up by BCD Global Distribution in October of 2003 for placement into Transworld operated record stores such as FYE. The single, “50/50 Amp”, has received airplay on college and commercial radio stations across the country, charting with Billboard and with CMJ. Kaze peaked at number 11 on the Rap Network in March of 2004, a chart tabulated by spins from the tastemakers of college radio.

Kaze’s April 2004 sophomore effort, titled Enemy of the State, is a mixtape which features a collection of tracks by North Carolina’s finest hip-hop artists and producers. With notable appearances by Nature and 9th Wonder among others, Kaze uses the album as a platform for voicing his desire to make it to the top of the industry and chronicles his success and struggle thus far. Kaze’s first single from Enemy of the State titled “On” is due to grow on the strength of his debut and aims for an even greater audience.

Kaze has become one of the most talked about and recognizable figures in the North Carolina music scene. With strong personality and a unique style, he reigns as a tested mic battle champion and regularly lights up stages at nationally known venues across the Southeast including the Smith Center, Gusman Theater, Cat’s Cradle, Echo Lounge, Local 506, Apache Cafe, and The Brewery. He has opened for such artists as Nas, Jurassic 5, KRS-One Dead Prez, The Arsonists, Swollen Members, and Camp Lo. He also can be heard working the crowds for Soul Dojo’s premier open mic night, Microphone Mondays, at Rolling Stone Magazine’s favorite Chapel Hill music venue, the Local 506.

4. Cristian, a.k.a Kaze is a rapper from Cartagena, Spain. He released his first album, No Encajes, in 2016.

35,35,ynw melly,879489,28916532,"Jamell Maurice Demons (born May 1, 1999), better known by his stage name YNW Melly, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter who emerged from Gifford, Florida. YNW Melly is also co-founder of rap collective, YNW. His music often draws from his lived experiences, evidenced by his 2017 incarceration for weapons charges. Upon release, he began to gain popularity from his track “Murder On My Mind.” which he wrote while in jail. After the release of the track, he was once again arrested as the song violated his probation, and sent him back to prison.

Melly’s career initially started to take off in 2018 when singles such as “Virtual (Blue Balenciagas)”, “Butter Pecan”, and “772 Love” had begun to gain popularity alongside “Murder on My Mind.”

On August 3, 2018, Melly released his debut mixtape I AM YOU which included his popular single, “Murder on My Mind”. It also included a sequel to the song called “Mind on My Murder”.

After leaving the studio with companions YNW Bortlen, YNW SakChaser, and YNW Juvy, on the night of October 26, 2018, Melly and his friends had been caught in a drive-by-shooting where SakChaser and Juvy were murdered. Melly and Bortlen were the only survivors of the attack.

While working on his sophomore mixtape, after the death of his friends, Melly had gained more attention and began to obtain cosigns from several rappers such as Young Thug, Trippie Redd, and Kodak Black. However, on January 3, 2019, Melly was arrested for possession of marijuana.

On January 18, 2019, while incarcerated, Melly released his sophomore mixtape We All Shine, which included one of his most influential cosign’s, Kanye West who was a feature on the song “Mixed Personalities.”.

Melly was released from jail on January 25, 2019, and released “Gang”, the first day out single that had taken off after the hype around “Mixed Personalities.”

After being released for only a month, on February 13, 2019, Melly turned himself in after a warrant was put out for him and Bortlen connecting to the murders of YNW Sakchaser and YNW Juvy. YNW Melly posted this to his Instagram on February 13:

To all my fans and supporters no I did not get locked up in Washington , but I am turning myself in today I want you guys to know I love you and appreciate every single one of y'all, a couple months ago I lost my two brothers by violence and now the system want to find justice.. unfortunately a lot of rumors and lies are being said but no worries god is with me and my brother @ynw.bortlen and we want y'all to remember it’s a ynw Family I love you @ynwsakchaser1 and @ynwjuvy #freeus

Prior to his incarceration, songs such as “Murder on My Mind” and “Mind on My Murder” had gained traction making their way in the Billboard Hot 100 and gaining RIAA certifications in a matter of months. Speculations made people believe that the songs were related to the murders, however, they were soon put to rest due to the time of the recordings being almost two years prior to the shootings.

After spending months incarcerated, on November 22, 2019, he released his debut studio album, Melly vs. Melvin featuring his 9lokkNine-assisted “223’s”.

After the rise of COVID-19 disease in 2020, on April 3, Melly had tested positive for the virus while awaiting trial. After being infected, Melly’s lawyers tried to play this to his advantage and requested a medical release as conditions can worsen in the jail environment. Melly was denied release on April 17 and conditions have been said to worsen since.

After the release of fellow Floridian rapper Kodak Black, Melly’s team had taken advantage and released “Thugged Out” to keep Melly’s name alive in the industry. They carried on releasing singles throughout the year with artists such as Queen Naija and Hotboii.

Again, while still awaiting trial, on August 13, 2021, he released his sophomore studio album, Just A Matter of Slime, featuring his highly anticipated Lil Uzi Vert-assisted “Mind of Melvin”.

After prosecutors had claimed they had a confession of Melly admitting to the murders, on November 1, Melly’s lawyers came out and denied the claims and said that Melly was just rapping a song titled “4:30 AM” by Kevin Gates. Soon after, on November 30, Melly’s trial had been set for March 7, 2022. - TippleTripple123 <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/YNW+Melly"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He became known after releasing two mixtapes in 2015, before attaining international attention with the release of the collaborative EP Savage Mode (2016) with Metro Boomin; its singles ""X"" (featuring Future) and ""No Heart"" peaked within the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 and 21 Savage's profile also later increased with a guest feature on Canadian Rapper and Singer Drake's 2016 single ""Sneakin'"". He then signed a recording contract with Epic Records in January 2017.

21 Savage's debut studio album, Issa Album (2017), peaked at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 and its lead single ""Bank Account"" reached number 12 on The Hot 100. He then released the collaborative album Without Warning (2017) with Offset and Metro Boomin, with the song ""Ric Flair Drip"" peaking at number 13 on the Hot 100. 21 Savage featured on Post Malone's 2017 single ""Rockstar"", which reached number one on the Hot 100 and nominated for Record of the Year and Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 2019 Grammy Awards. His second album, i am > i was (2018), became his first U.S. number one album and spawned the hit song ""A Lot"" (featuring J. Cole), which won Best Rap Song at the 2020 Grammy Awards. 

21 Savage was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on February 3, 2019. Officials revealed his status as a British citizen who entered the U.S. in July 2005 and unlawfully overstayed a H-4 visa that expired in 2006. He was granted bond on February 12 and released the next day, pending the outcome of an expedited deportation hearing, which was initially scheduled for April 9, but was later postponed indefinitely, with 21 Savage's lawyers stating he was legally residing in The U.S. for several years prior to the 2005 H-4 visa. 21 Savage's highly anticipated third album, Savage Mode II (2020), a sequel collaboration with Metro Boomin to their 2016 EP, debuted atop the Billboard 200, and spawned the U.S. top 10 singles ""Runnin"" and ""Mr. Right Now"" (featuring Drake).

On November 4th, 2022, 21 Savage would release ""Her Loss"", a collab album with Drake. It debuted at No.1 on the US Billboard 200. All 16 of its songs debuted on the Hot 100. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/21+Savage"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

40,40,eminem,6924087,455843622,"Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972 in St. Joseph, MO), known professionally as Eminem (stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is credited with popularizing hip-hop in Middle America and is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. His success is considered to have broken racial barriers to the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as influencing many musical artists. His most successful songs on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 include ""The Real Slim Shady"", ""Without Me"", ""Lose Yourself"", ""Not Afraid"", ""Love the Way You Lie"", ""The Monster"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Houdini"".

After the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2002. After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry with the releases of Relapse (2009) and Recovery (2010), the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2010. He then released the U.S. number-one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018), Music to Be Murdered By (2020), and The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) (2024).

Eminem was also a member of the hip-hop groups New Jacks, Soul Intent, Outsidaz, and D12, and has collaborated with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9"" as the duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem starred in the 2002 musical drama film 8 Mile playing a dramatized version of himself. ""Lose Yourself"", a song from its soundtrack, topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 weeks—the most for a solo rap song—and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making him the first hip-hop artist ever to win the award. He also co-founded Shady Records, which helped launch the careers of artists such as D12, 50 Cent, and Obie Trice, and established his own Sirius XM Radio channel, Shade 45.

Eminem is amongst the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States for the 2000s, placing third for the 2010s. He was the first artist to have ten albums consecutively debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and has had five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits (2005), ""Lose Yourself"", ""Love the Way You Lie"", and ""Not Afraid"" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. Billboard named him the ""Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)"", and Rolling Stone named him one of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"" and ""100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time"". In 2022, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Early life

Marshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah ""Debbie"" (née Nelson). His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him. Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before they separated. His father abandoned his family when Eminem was a year and a half old, and Eminem was raised only by his mother, Debbie, in poverty. He wrote letters to his father, but Debbie said that they all came back marked ""return to sender"".

By the age of twelve, Eminem and his mother shuttled between states, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and mostly living with family members, moved several times and lived in St. Joseph, Savannah, Missouri, Kansas City, Warren, Michigan and Roseville, Michigan before settling in Detroit. For much of his youth, Eminem and his mother lived in a working-class, primarily black, Detroit neighborhood. He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten several times by black youths. His mother had a son named Nathan ""Nate"" Kane Samara.

Eminem frequently fought with his mother, whom a social worker described as having a ""very suspicious, almost paranoid personality"". When he was a child, a bully named D'Angelo Bailey severely injured Eminem's head in an assault, an incident which Eminem later recounted (with comic exaggeration) on the song ""Brain Damage"". Debbie filed a lawsuit against the public school for this in 1982. The suit was dismissed the following year by a Macomb County, Michigan, judge, who said the schools were immune from lawsuits.

Eminem was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic book artist before discovering hip-hop. He heard his first rap song (""Reckless"", featuring Ice-T) on the Breakin' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie's half-brother, Ronnie Polkingharn. His uncle was close to the boy and later became a musical mentor to him. Following Polkingharn's suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking publicly for days and did not attend his funeral.

At age 14, Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names ""Manix"" and ""M&M"", the latter evolving into ""Eminem"". Eminem snuck into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles. On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile Road, considered ""ground zero"" for the Detroit rap scene. Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip-hop audiences. When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable. Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes.

In 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Anne ""Kim"" Scott to stay at their home. Several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott. After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades, 17-year-old Eminem dropped out of Lincoln High School. Although interested in English, Eminem never explored literature, preferring comic books, and he disliked math and social studies. He states that he later received a GED.Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills, one of which was at Little Caesar's Pizza in Warren. He later said she often threw him out of the house anyway, often after taking most of his paycheck. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.

Alter egos

Eminem uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter, including Slim Shady and Ken Kaniff, among others.

Slim Shady is the controversial and rebellious alter ego of Eminem, introduced in his 1997 extended play The Slim Shady EP. Conceived during a period of personal and professional struggle, Slim Shady allowed Eminem to express his darker, more aggressive thoughts through exaggerated and often violent lyrical content. This persona embodies the chaotic, satirical side of Eminem's music, pushing boundaries with provocative, sometimes offensive, themes, which blend fiction and reality. The use of Slim Shady is shown in The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Encore, Relapse, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, Kamikaze, Music to Be Murdered By, and The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce).

Slim Shady's influence on Eminem's career is significant. His shock-value content helped skyrocket the rapper to fame, but also attracted criticism and legal challenges, particularly due to songs like ""'97 Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""Kim"", where he addresses deeply personal and often disturbing subjects, such as family conflicts and imagined violence. Despite the controversy, the Slim Shady character is credited with much of Eminem's early success, but over time, the persona also contributed to the rapper's personal struggles, including substance abuse.

Another character is Ken Kaniff, a gay man who pokes fun at Eminem's songs. Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on The Slim Shady LP, where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem. An argument after the album's release prompted Eminem to use the Kaniff character on The Marshall Mathers LP and later albums (except Encore and Recovery). Aristotle, angry with Eminem's use of his character, released a mixtape in his Kaniff persona ridiculing him.

Acting Career

After small roles in the 2001 film The Wash and as an extra in the 1998 Korn music video for ""Got the Life"" (during which he gave the band a demo tape), Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the semi-autobiographical 2002 film 8 Mile. He said it was a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including ""Lose Yourself"" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running No. 1 hip-hop single in history). Eminem was absent from the ceremony and co-composer Luis Resto accepted the award.

Eminem voiced an aging, corrupt, AAVE-speaking police officer in the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof and guested on the Comedy Central television show Crank Yankers and a Web cartoon, The Slim Shady Show He was signed to star in an unmade film version of Have Gun – Will Travel, and was considered for the role of David Rice in the 2008 film Jumper. Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with Ray Romano, in the 2009 film Funny People. In a 2010 interview with Jonathan Ross, he stated ""You know, I love music so much. This is my passion, this is what I want to do. Not saying that I won't do a movie ever again, but this is me.""

He played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale ""Lose Yourself"" with Christina Aguilera. Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because director Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit. Eminem had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2014 film The Interview. During an interview with the main character, Dave Skylark (James Franco), Eminem satirically comes out as gay.

Books and memoirs

On November 21, 2000, Eminem published Angry Blonde, a non-fiction book featuring a commentary of several of his own songs, along with several previously unpublished photographs.

On October 21, 2008, his autobiography The Way I Am was published. The book was first published on October 21, 2008, by Dutton Adult. It is a collection of Eminem's personal stories, reflections, photographs, original artwork, and original lyric sheets from ""Stan"" and ""The Real Slim Shady"". It details his struggles with poverty, drugs, fame, heartbreak, family and depression, along with stories about his rise to fame and commentary on past controversies. The book is illustrated with never before published photos of Eminem's life. It also contains original drawings, previously unpublished lyric sheets, and other rare memorabilia. The autobiography is named after his 2000 song ""The Way I Am"".

An autobiography of Eminem's mother (My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem) was published the following month, in which Debbie Nelson describes her childhood and adolescence, meeting Eminem's father and her son's rise to (and struggles with) fame.

43,43,sons of aguirre,6657,280371,"El grupo Sons of Aguirre es compuesto por David (Día Sexto o WillyLET) y Víctor (@masademocrata o McEndesa). Ambos son las voces de este dúo que recorren letras con sátira anticapitalista con innumerables referencias a diversos componentes de la Historia: desde pensadores con ideología diferente como Hayek, Marx y Engels hasta protagonistas actuales como Albert Rivera y Podemos. Sus canciones solo se encuentran disponible en Youtube, en forma de videoclip, en el  canal de @masademocrata, donde son subidas cuando ellos quieren. El nombre es una doble referencia: por una parte a la serie Sons of Anarchy y, por otra, a Esperanza Aguirre. El logo fue hecho por el tuitero  @proscojoncio. Para ellos, el grupo es solo un entretenimiento porque ellos tienen sus respectivos trabajos. David ha hecho canciones de rap en solitario mientras que Víctor, como él mismo reconocía después no había rapeado nunca. 

El estreno de Sons of Aguirre fue con  Vete a Cuba, el 6 de mayo de 2015. Se trata de una crítica-sátira sobre los argumentos absurdos sobre el votante medio liberal español hacia la izquierda. Tuvo bastante éxito con muy buena recepción lo que hizo que, poco después, sacaron su segunda canción de ellos:  Los chicos del FMI con Toni Mejías de Los Chikos del Maíz. Esta es la más escuchada, habiendo superado el millón de reproducciones en la plataforma.

Más tarde sacaron temas con el mismo fondo y con distintos recursos: en Ajo Infuso, con MSIAS, recurren al trap, por ejemplo. A finales de verano no tenían nada nuevo distinto de estas tres canciones. Sin embargo, en septiembre publicaron, en Youtube también, cuatro nuevas canciones que, hasta el momento son las últimas. En octubre van a tener una gira llamada Vete a Cuba 2K16 con conciertos en Murcia, Sevilla, Madrid (por partida doble), Barcelona y Alicante durante todo el mes. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sons+of+Aguirre"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

45,45,mac miller,2960443,327584611,"Malcolm McCormick, also known by his stage name Mac Miller, was an American rapper, singer-songwriter and record producer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was also a noted record producer under the pseudonym Larry Fisherman. Raised Jewish and teaching himself music from a young age, McCormick defied the stereotypes of hip-hop and released his first mixtape under the name EZ Mac, titled ""But My Mackin' Ain't Easy"" in 2007, when McCormick was only fifteen. He released many more in his lifetime, including ""K.I.D.S."" in 2010, which earned Mac widespread attention in the hip-hop scene, and ""Best Day Ever"" in 2011, which featured the hit single ""Donald Trump"". 

He was signed to Pittsburgh-based Rostrum Records and released his debut album Blue Slide Park on November 8, 2011, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 despite being released completely independently. He released five studio albums in his lifetime, which all peaked in the top 5, along with a posthumous album titled ""Circles"" with help from producer Jon Brion and Miller's family.

In 2013, Miller released his second studio album, ""Watching Movies With the Sound Off"". The album featured artists such as Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler, The Creator, Ab-Soul, and long-time friend ScHoolboy Q. The album took a more personal approach compared to his previous works.

In 2014, Miller released the 24-track mixtape ""Faces"". Considered by many to be one of his best works, he explores themes of drug use, employing and featuring collaborators of Mac from his previous album, including ScHoolboy Q and Earl Sweatshirt, but also sees new faces such as Rick Ross. 

In 2015, Mac released his third studio album, ""GO:OD AM"", his first with new label Warner Records. The album featured a more energetic and vibrant theme than ""Faces"" and ""Watching Movies With the Sound Off"", reflecting a more optimistic,  redemptive angle on his personal life, while maintaining elements of his introspective and thought-provoking style from earlier works.

In 2016, Miller released his fourth studio album, titled ""The Divine Feminine"". He explores themes of love and femininity, largely influenced by his relationship with Ariana Grande at the time and featuring appearances from the likes of Kendrick Lamar and Anderson Paak. 

In August 2018, following major events in Miller's life, including his breakup with Ariana Grande, with Miller's drug addiction alleged to be a contributing factor, as well as a car crash incident in which McCormick was charged with a DUI, Miller released his fifth and final studio album during his lifetime titled ""Swimming"". Continuing the dive into his personal life, Miller explores his heartfelt struggles and grief in the past, but remains optimistic for the future. Swimming was nominated for Best Rap Album posthumously at the 2019 Grammy Awards.

Miller had struggled with substance abuse for a long time before his death. On September 7, 2018, he was found dead in his home in Los Angeles, California from an accidental overdose of fentanyl, cocaine, and alcohol, only a little over a month after the release of ""Swimming"".  He was only 26 years old. McCormick was buried in his hometown of Pittsburgh. Miller's passing was largely unexpected and had a large impact on the hip-hop community as a whole, with many paying their respects to Miller.  On October 31, 2018, a tribute concert, titled ""Mac Miller: A Celebration of Life"", featured renowned artists and many longtime collaborators of Miller including Travis Scott, ScHoolboy Q, SZA, Chance the Rapper, and Earl Sweatshirt. The concert was a celebration of the late rapper's life and musical achievements, and all profits were donated to the Mac Miller Circles Fund, which provides young people from underprivileged backgrounds with opportunities to explore arts and music.

 In January 2020, Miller's posthumous album titled ""Circles"", worked on in companionship with his album ""Swimming"", was announced on January 8 along with the single ""Good News"" and released later that month. Every track on the album was accompanied by a video of the same name, often with psychedelic imagery and images of Mac before his passing and throughout his life. With a more melancholic theme compared to his previous works, the album was well-received by fans and critics alike, renowned for the care placed in continuing Mac's artistic vision. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mac+Miller"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

46,46,meek mill,1552279,39165945,"Robert Williams (born May 6, 1987), better known by his stage name Meek Mill, is an American rapper from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was briefly signed to T.I.'s label Grand Hustle Records and in February 2011 signed to Rick Ross' Maybach Music Group. He adopted the rap name “Meek Mill” after family and friends from his neighborhood kept referencing him by his middle name. Meek is coined as the latest rap phenomenon to come out of the city of Philadelphia.

Raised in the North Philadelphia section of the city with his sister and inspired by his mother and father; who died when he was five, Meek Mill began taking the rap game seriously at the age of 12 after losing a street battle to neighboring rappers. He says his desire to rap grew after watching his uncle Philly hip-hop pioneer Grandmaster Nell. While hanging out in his neighborhood, Meek met three guys and formed the group, “BloodHoundz,” which consisted of Mel Love, Dat Nigga Leel and Young Pooh. The group lasted for fives years and Meek ventured on his own.

With a solo career in tow, Meek became one of Philadelphia’s hottest underground rap artists on an independent label. In 2007, Meek debuted his Flamerz series, which stands for hottest songs and released his first mix tape, Flamerz 1, which featured the hit single, “In My Bag.”

In 2008, Meek debuted the highly anticipated Flamerz 2 –“Hottest In Da City,” which showcased more of his lyrical abilities with the singles, “So Fly,” “Prolli,” and “Hottest In Da City.” Upon release of Flamerz 2, it caught the attention of founder and President of 215Aphillyated Records, Charlie Mack. Mack was immediately impressed with Meek that he signed him to his management company. During the same year, he met the founder and owner of Grand Hustle, TI. TI was impressed with his lyrical ability that he offered him an opportunity to travel to Los Angeles to meet with him along with the Warner Brothers Records, within one week both record companies offered him a deal. Meek was overwhelmed by the offers; however, he felt collaborating with TI was an opportunity of a lifetime and chose his label. An ecstatic Meek was on top of the world; a record deal and the chance to work with one of hip hop’s greatest rappers and then a set back occurred. He was arrested, charged with a crime and order to serve seven months in jail.

Meek pre-released three singles from his third mix tape Flamerz 2.5 – “The Preview” in August of 2009, which featured the chart topping hits, “Make ‘Em Say,” “Imma Da Ish,” featuring Ms. Jade and “Starting Something,” in honor Michael Jackson. Within the first two weeks of its release, Clear Channel added it to their play list, which is an anomaly in the music business. In June of 2009, Meek began immediately working on his freshman album – Flamerz 3, “Hottest In America – Gangster Grill Edition,” hosted by DJ Drama and featuring the songs: “Baby Girl,” “Hottest In America,” and “I’m Killinem.” The highly anticipated cd is set to be released on January 19, 2010. Despite his stint in jail, Meek’s fans remained loyal, he currently boasts of 13 million hits on My Space and 20 million viewers on You Tube. Meek Mill has recently just signed to Rick Ross's Maybach Music Group.

In the future, Meek plans to establish the Meek Mill Foundation, which will mentor young males between the ages of 12-24 on the importance of “Education over Incarceration.” He gives a shoutout to the next artist coming up named shizz.. He also plans to collaborate with United Community Action Network and the Lifers of Graterford Prison to address the violence plaguing our cities.  To learn more about Meek, you can visit the official website: www.meekmillflamerz.com and for bookings or shows, you can call Charlie Mack at 215-910-4675 or e-mail: firstoutdalimo@aol.com. 

2015 - BEEF WITH DRAKE
In July 2015 Meek attempted to air out Drake for ""not writing his own raps"" via popular social media site Twitter. These tweets resulted in a huge reaction from the hip hop community, however, the stunt went awry when Drake (Aubrey Graham) decided to respond. Drake released the diss track ""Charged Up"" during an Apple Music stream and an immediate response from Meek was demanded. Funkmaster Flex announced he would debut Meek's response live on Hot97. However, the track never came. After four days there was still no sign of a response from Meek, prompting Drake to release a second diss track ""Back To Back."" The response to this was huge and a harsh blow to Meek's career. Two days later Meek finally released ""Wanna Know."" This track received largely negative reviews and it was clear to most that Drake had won the beef. On August 2nd at the annual OVOfest, Drake truly roasted Meek Mill; performing ""Back To Back"" in front of various memes poking fun at Meek to a raucous Toronto crowd. Many fans believed this to be the nail in the coffin spelling the end for Meek's career.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Meek+Mill"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His debut single ""Live Sheck Wes"", released in 2016, found some moderate success on the streaming app SoundCloud.

He was later signed to a joint deal in 2018 with Kanye West's ""G.O.O.D. Music"" and Travis Scott's ""Cactus Jack"" label, and his debut project, ""MUDBOY"" was released on October 5th of that same year.

Despite not being a single, Travis Scott's ""ASTROWORLD"" album track alongside Juice WRLD and Sheck Wes titled ""No Bystanders"" charted in some countries, including the USA, where at #31 it was Wes' first entry in the country.

Following the track's mild success, the song ""Mo Bamba"", off his aforementioned debut album and inspired by his friendship with the basketball player of the same name, became a smash hit over a year after its release, reaching the top positions of charts all around the world, including a #5 in Canada and a #6 in the USA.

Part of the single's popularity was due to an Internet meme were Know-it-all, a character from the animated 2004 film ""Polar Express"", was supposedly asking a group of people if they wanted to hear the above-mentioned hit single by Sheck Wes or label mate Travis Scott's track ""SICKO MODE"".

His following singles ""Do That"", ""Chippi Chippi"" and ""Enzo (with DJ Snake featuring Offset, Gucci Mane and 21 Savage)"" failed to enter any important charts. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sheck+Wes"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

48,48,gucci mane,2399227,50610363,"Radric Davis (born February 12, 1980 in Birmingham, Alabama), better known by his stage name Gucci Mane, is an American rapper and CEO of 1017 Brick Squad Records. In 2005 he released his independent debut album, Trap House, which featured the successful single ""Icy"" that he recorded with Young Jeezy. He has since released a further three albums including 2006's Hard To Kill, 2007's Trap-A-Thon and 2007's Back To The Trap House. His sixth studio album, The State vs Radric Davis, was released in December 2009, just weeks after he was sent back to prison for 12 months for violating his probation. He was released in May 2010 and will now release his seventh studio album, The Appeal: Georgia's Most Wanted, sometime at the end of 2010.

It’s said that art mirrors life. In hip-hop’s case, there’s always been a deliberate entanglement of perception and reality. Fans demand their MCs be real…but never too real. Successful hip-hop is about the hint of the danger, the tease of it, the mystique. Hip-hop is about balance.

Gucci Mane is an artist striving for that balance, volatility versus musicality. Controversy, including a feud with former collaborator Young Jeezy, has grabbed the headlines, with insufficient regard paid to his considerable mic skills, raw talent, and business acumen. Gucci is looking to wrest his name from public speculation and let his own words do the talking.

“I wish everybody well who’s making money in this rap game,” the Atlanta-raised rapper says, dismissing the controversy that followed him in the past. “My own rap game is going so good, I’ve got so many things on my plate at my label, that I don’t got time for other people’s business.” With a deal with Asylum Records as the boss of his own label, So Icey Entertainment, Gucci does indeed have a full schedule with no time to dwell on the past.

“I live my life with no regrets. I just wish that a lot of things never happened, but anybody can wish,” says Gucci. Sounds like a man with his eyes on the prize. And you’d expect nothing less from an artist who ground his way to the top via the hustle of independent records. Signing to Big Cat Records in the wake of his local single “Black Tee,” he dropped his debut record, Trap House, in May 2005. The independent album moved an impressive 140,000 units, largely on the strength of the “Icy” single, featuring Jeezy. Clamor over song rights sparked dispute, and the resulting rift grew.

Controversy notwithstanding, Mane’s independence was cemented: “I was on the independent scene for about two years,” he recalls. “It’s crazy! You gotta go into your own pocket to support your craft. You need other avenues to have money coming in, to support your stuff. You might win, you might lose, and it’s a gamble out there with the independent circuit. One thing you’d better have is good music because without that, you go downhill fast in the independent game.”

Good music firmly in hand, Gucci was fast approaching stardom when more tragedy befell him. But let’s backtrack; how did the man born Radric Davis in Bessemer, Alabama, become Gucci Mane, mouthpiece for Atlanta stuntin’? Mane remembers little from his time in Alabama, just that it was rural, and that it’s changed dramatically since he left at the age of nine. “I gotta shout out Alabama though, because they holdin’ it down,” he affirms. “Every time I go there to do a show, I’m impressed with how hip-hop culture has taken root.”

Mane’s identity coalesced when he moved with his mother to Atlanta. “I lived all of my adolescent and adult life in Atlanta,” he explains. “I’m from East Atlanta Zone Six; it was hard, man, it was real rough. I grew up in the Starter jacket era: they’d take your Starter jacket, your 8Ball jacket, they’d take your hat, your shoes. It was just no holds barred on the streets, dog eat dog. If you missed the bus, you had to be crewed up or you’d get jumped. It was wild when I came up.”

It’s a bleak portrait. When asked to describe his home life more vividly, Mane offers a look into his contemplative side, a side honed as a schoolyard poet. “I was just a young dude in a single parent house most of my life. I can’t complain that much. I would guess it’s like any black child growing up in a single parent household. There are a lot of people who know how that is. I didn’t have a lot coming up; but what I did have, I appreciated. I was blessed to have a caring mother to raise me right and to help me with my business ventures; she’s been there through the whole struggle. There’s a lot that goes along with that; it made me who I am today.”

A stepfather would enter the picture during Mane’s adolescence, introducing not only a male figure, but also inspiration for Mane’s unusual moniker. “My father came in, the original Gucci Mane; that’s what people in the neighborhood called him, and that’s where I get my name from. From then on, I grew up the son of a hustler and a schoolteacher; it was the best of both worlds because I was educated twice.” Drawing inspiration from a pantheon of rappers before him –Big Daddy Kane, LL Cool J, Ice Cube, the Beastie Boys, N.W.A—Mane went on to release Trap House, a lethal brew of his signature sound: “I call my music straight Gucci: going hard and whatever beats you make you for me, if I’m feeling it, if I’m rocking with it, I’m gonna crush it. When you hear me, you hear a lot of pain, a lot of hood; you hear what’s going on in the inner city in Atlanta.”

Unfortunately, Trap House was ill timed; the month of its release, Gucci was accused of murder and jailed for two days. Eventually deemed to be acting in self-defense, and without sufficient evidence to hold him, Mane was exonerated. But the ordeal left an indelible imprint on the man. “I learned to keep better company, watch where I go, and be mindful of my surroundings at all times,” he reveals. “Watch what I say, watch what I do and how I do it, just keep myself out of the wrong crowd.”

“I always stand up man,” he continues. “I’m one of the toughest guys I know. It’ll take a lot more than that to break me down.” Undeterred, Mane was back in the studio, preparing 2006’s eerily apropos Hard To Kill. The buzz from Hard To Kill vaulted Gucci Mane from regional commodity to national treasure, and major labels responded accordingly: “There was a bidding war going on, and I liked Atlantic’s approach. They made it known that they wanted me, they felt where I was going and that I could grow with them.”

Asylum/Atlantic Records welcomed Gucci Mane in early ’07, granting him his own imprint, So Icey Entertainment. With it comes an entire stable of artists, the So Icey Boyz. As the Boyz ready for their own exposure –“I got them in training; they be in the weight room, pumping iron, doing pushups, shopping at the mall, buying ice”—Gucci is focused on his magnum opus, Back to the Trap House. “I started working on the album, and by the third song, I was like ‘This is going back to the Trap House.’ I started feeling the same way I did when I made my first album. It had the same feel to it, the same freshness. And I had the same hunger and desire I had when I first started rapping.”

“Since I went major, I want everybody to know I’m still keeping it street, keeping it hood,” Gucci maintains. “I’m trying to take it back to all my fans that I had when I first started my career. And at the same time, I’m trying to open up my new album to a new fan base. So it’s a mix for everybody coming together, like my first album was.” Gucci has always prided himself on his innate ability, and his refusal to let guest appearances dictate the tone of his records. “I just want people to know I’m a great songwriter, man,” he asserts. “I’m passionate about what I do, and it’s choreographed strategically when I do it. I bring a lot of experience, creative wordplay, and a crazy style. And my albums, I record most of the songs without writing them down; it’s a God-given gift and I just get paid for it. It come from God, it’s like wondering what makes a bird fly. He made me a poet like the great poets of the past.”

But don’t mistake Gucci’s confidence for self-absorption. The vicissitudes of his career have dictated a longer view. Lyrics aside, he’s less preoccupied with visible means and more so with acting as an emissary from his under-repped block. “I’m not the one to glorify what goes on in the hood,” he insists. “We have everything there, the whole range from violence to people getting on the bus and going to work. There’s a lot more to the hood than just drugs. It’s a bigger story, there’s a big picture. I went to school in that neighborhood, I worked there, I trapped there, I hustled there, and I got my name there. I’m proud to be from East Atlanta Zone Six, and I claim there. I hold that on my back and carry that, to be the first one from there to really rock.”

And Gucci’s professional aims have matured as well. While other rappers stress platinum plaques, Gucci hasn’t forgotten the route he took to stardom. “I made a lot of CDs on my own. People fucked with me and supported me, and just made me the man I am today. That’s my blueprint right there, and I stay mindful of it. So now, my only concern is that people feel my music; at the end of the day, I do it for people to feel it. If one person feel it, two people feel it, I feel like my job’s been done.”

Fortunately for Gucci, he should be prepared to welcome an army of new fans with Back to the Trap House. But longstanding fans shouldn’t fear; they’ll recognize “Freaky Gurl,” reprised from its previous appearance from Hard To Kill. Luda, upon hearing the joint, asked for a guest spot on the remix. Said remix now appears as the lead single on Back to the Trap House, following in Gucci’s theme of mating old and new. Over a bouncing, meandering beat from Cyber Sapp, the two cook up the requisite concoction of whips, chips, and chicks. Also look out for “Bird Flu,” the album’s number two single, laced by New-York based Supa Sonics. Elsewhere, firm guest verses from Rich Boy and Pimp C of UGK round out Gucci’s regional flavor, while Bay-area producer Zaytoven (of “Icy” renown) locks down Gucci’s West Coast appeal.

Gucci Mane has something for everyone, and with the struggles of the past in his rearview, Gucci is settled in for his ride to the top. “I’m best known for controversy but I’m trying to gain respect as a songwriter and entertainer. I plan to hit them so hard with this album; who knows what the future will bring. I’ll be banging them out till I can’t bang no more.”

Se presentó en el panorama con su primer tema Killa. Una canción que sienta unas bases muy claras, una carta de presentación como mujer empoderada, llena de espíritu underground. La artista se ha ganado el respeto de todos los artistas de trap del panorama latino, llegando a colaborar con muchos de ellos.

After years of performing in local talent shows, Orlando soon introduced him to Russell ""Block"" Spencer, founder and CEO of Block Entertainment. When Jacquees started going to the studio he merely blended with the team and wasn't given the opportunity to express his true talents. ""When you see work being done around you but not for you, you tend to get discouraged,"" says Jacquees. At that time, Block's focus was only rap, not R&B. It wasn't until summer of 2009 when Block witnessed how talented Jacquees was and shifted his vision.

Born and raised in Marietta, Georgia, producer Mike WiLL Made It first got into music hanging around his Uncle Al, a musician himself, who not only fostered Mike’s love for production, but also a sense of pride in accomplishment that comes from perseverance, individuality, and developing one’s own identity.

Mike WiLL’s own mixtape, Est. In 1989, a collection of singles and previously released tracks that Mike has produced, a way to catch new fans and Johnny-come-lately industry representatives up on what Mike WiLL has been up to over the past few years. Also included on the tape are handful of previously unreleased exclusives, including the tape’s lead single, “Itchin’,” which features Future and has already garnered radio play, and “Animosity,” a track that features Gucci Mane and Yo Gotti.

All told, Mike WiLL’s placements have earned him well over 20 million YouTube views, heavy radio play, his first Billboard charting single, and his own burgeoning production company, all before the age of 24 – and with plenty more still to come. “I want to work with everybody, whoever I haven’t worked with yet,” remarks Mike, noting that he has no intention of limiting himself by genre as his career continues to flourish. “From street rap to Disney to pop; I want to do it all.” And as it’s been since he first discovered his love and passion for music from his Uncle Al as a young kid, no matter what he’s doing, Mike WiLL Made It will do it in a style all his own.

76,76,jay rock,1190896,20460838,"Johnny Reed McKinzie Jr. (born March 31, 1986 in Watts, Los Angeles, California), better known by his stage name Jay Rock, is an American rapper. He was named one of the top 13 most street artists by XXL. His voice has been called a cross between The Notorious B.I.G. and Shyne. He is a part of the rap group Black Hippy which also features Kendrick Lamar, Schoolboy Q and Ab-Soul. Rock signed to Strange Music and released his long-awaited debut studio album Follow Me Home on July 2011.

For a rapper to command your attention, it all comes down to the voice. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Public Enemys Chuck D had millions of fans hanging on to every word of his booming baritone. In the mid-1990s, The Notorious B.I.G.s steely poise and vocal precision led many critics and fans to proclaim him the best rapper of all time. Now, in 2006, get ready for the next rapper with a magnetic voice, someone whose pristine raps demand attention. His name: Jay Rock. 

Born and raised in Watts, Californias notorious Nickerson Gardens Projects, Jay Rock got his first encouragement from his music-making relatives, who noticed the impact his deep, melodic voice made on song after song. They were like, youre hard. And youve got a voice for it, too. Youve got a real cool voice to it, Jay Rock recalls: ""A lot of people started hearing me and they would tell me that my voice catches them. So, I started working it, working on my craft and got more and more confidence."" His rap name is inspired by a character off the hit Canadian comedy show Trailer Park Boys. 

Jay Rocks confidence led to a string of heated appearances on neighborhood mixtapes. The gifted rhymers clever phrasing, gritty realism, storytelling swagger and powerful voice grabbed the attention of Top Dawg Entertainment boss Dude Dawg. Once in the studio with an independent company backing him, Jay Rocks output increased and improved. 

After shopping his demo to a number of major labels, Jay Rock and Top Dawg earned a deal with industry powerhouse Warner Bros. Records, also home to Lil Jons BME Recordings, E-40, The Federation and Talib Kweli, among others. The Warner Bros. executives were impressed with Jay Rocks distinctive flow, his vivid lyrics and, of course, voice. Already a star on the Internet, his always-updated myspace.com/jayrock page features three songs that have more than 100,000 plays. 

One of those cuts is LA Shit, Jay Rocks stellar reworking of Busta Rhymes New York Shit. When I heard that song, I thought it was a hot-ass song, so I wanted to get on my LA shit about what we do out here, says Jay Rock, who has long been a fan of Busta Rhymes phraseology. I was paying respect to Busta and his song, and thats for the mixtapes right there. I want LA to get an ear for it. 

LA will also appreciate the energetic California Soul, which details the treacherous reality of Californias streets. Game produced the record and he gave it to me. I met him at the studio about a week later and let him hear ithe went crazy! He liked it so much he recorded the hook on the spot. On the smooth Thats My Word, Jay Rock asserts his status as a man of his word, while To The Top documents his ascent from project resident to his present day successes. It was a struggle to get to where Im at now, he says. Im talking about going from the bottom to the top, what I was going through starting off. Im legal now. Im signed. I started off at the bottom, made something out of nothing and am going to run with it until I get all the way to the top. 

As someone who looks toward the past as he pushes toward the future, Jay Rock holds the soulful Back In The Days in high regard. I just went back to when I was 6, 7, growing up listening to the oldies, he explains. That song meant a lot because I always dwell on the past, for some reason. I always think back and wish that I was a kid again. I know that will never happen, but some times I just wish I could go back in the days when I was young. 

For now, though, Jay Rock is focused on recording his debut album and ushering in a new era of hard-core West Coast rap. Jay Rock is thankful that Comptons The Game was able to breakthrough with his multi platinum, The Documentary album. Game opened up the doors for a lot of people, Jay Rock says. Game opened the door and Im running right through with my people behind me. Were trying to bring it back home, bring the West back. Weve been down for a long time, so were trying to bring it back home. 

With production on his forthcoming debut album from such A-List producers as KayGee (Jaheim, Naughty By Nature) and L.E.S. (Nas), as well up-and-coming beatsmiths Nephew, 4th Quarter and K-Fam, Soundwave and Aqua (Jay-Z), Jay Rock is set to live out a dream that seemed to be destined to happen. 

His hard-working mother filled their home with the classic soul and blues music of such icons as the Temptations, Dramatics, Isley Brothers, Johnny Guitar Watson and B.B. King. She also had an affinity for rap, and enjoyed the music of such trendsetters as Big Daddy Kane and Biz Markie. Her love for music carried over to her house parties. My mom threw parties damn near every weekend, Jay Rock recalls. Shed be stressing during the week, would come home and thats what theyd do, party all night long. 

Jay Rock soon developed an interest in playing keyboards and, at age 12, writing poems. And, as he grew up in the volatile Watts streets, gangster rap began to take hold. You couldnt go up the street without hearing Snoop, Dre or N.W.A, he says. Much as N.W.A and others reported about their surroundings, Jay Rocks early poems documented his feelings -- about a person, about Los Angeles, about his experiences. 

Jay Rock soon started getting into trouble at school, forcing him to attend a number of different schools. He also endured a harsh reality when cited and incarcerated for violating his areas gang injunction. I was hanging out with dudes I grew up with, dudes I went to school with, played Pop Warner with, he says. They saw us out there and took us downThey put me on it...I basically cant hang out where I liveI cant help where I stayThey got me again when I was hanging out of my own apartment, my own residence. 

Jay Rocks legal struggles have made him appreciate what he has already accomplished, turning his childhood talent for writing into a career as a major-label recording artist. Getting signed and being from what Im from, thats a great achievement because nobodys really been signed from my projects, Jay Rock says: ""Thats a big achievement for me. Its a blessing. It feels real good. I could be in the jail somewhere or in the grave, but Im right here doing what I need to do. 

And it all starts with the voice.

Dinos naît le 30 novembre 1993 à Douala, au Cameroun, et arrive en France à l'âge de 4 ans avec sa famille où ils s'installent dans la cité des 4000 à La Courneuve, en Seine-Saint-Denis. Il sort son premier projet, Thumbs Up, en 2011, puis commence à se faire un nom dans les Rap Contenders, où deux MCs s'affrontent a capella.

En mai 2013, Dinos signe sur le label Def Jam France et, le 3 juin 2013, sort un EP intitulé L'alchimiste en référence au livre du même nom de Paulo Coelho.

Courant 2014, Dinos quitte Def Jam France pour Capitol Music France et sort, le 14 avril 2014, un second EP intitulé Apparences, porté par le titre Namek; lequel rencontre un certain succès.

Après une longue période d'absence sur le devant de la scène il annonce son premier album Imany qu'il ne sortira que 2 ans après. Entre l'annonce de cet album et la sortie de celui-ci, il sort Pas Imany mais presque en 2016. Dinos marque son retour le 8 décembre 2017 avec le titre Flashé. Le 30 mars 2018, il dévoile le single Les pleurs du mal. Le 27 avril 2018, Dinos sort Imany, son premier album studio. Malgré un succès critique quasi-unanime, l'album ne fait que 3.131 ventes lors de sa première semaine d'exploitation. Il faut cependant préciser que cet album est très personnel et ne comporte aucun son destiné à être un succès commercial Le 20 août 2018, il participe à Colors, émission musicale allemande très populaire sur YouTube, et livre une prestation live de son titre Argentique. Il participe au projet 93 Empire produit par Affranchis Music (Sofiane), ou il est présent sur 2 titres (Drive By feat Sadek et Ixzo et Viens dans mon 93 feat Sofiane et Hornet La Frappe). Le 7 décembre 2018, l'artiste sort une édition « Deluxe » et qui comprend 7 titres inédits, dont Placebo, qui aura un grand succès sur les plateformes de streaming.

Un an et demi après Imany, le 4 octobre 2019, Dinos sort le titre XNXX, premier extrait de son album Taciturne, qui sort le 29 novembre de la même année. Viennent ensuite les titres Mack le Bizz Freestyle et Oskur, tous deux clippés. Avec Taciturne, Dinos écoule 7815 exemplaires en 1 semaine d'exploitation. Un score honorable d'autant plus que Dinos a sorti son album le même jour que Gradur et SCH, deux rappeurs habitués aux grands succès commerciaux. cela ne l’empêchera pas d'avoir son premier disque d'or plusieurs semaines avant la sortie de son dernier album Stamina,

Le 27 novembre 2020, il publie Stamina, son troisième album. Alors que l'album a réservé son lot de surprises, notamment la présence de featurings cachés, il a aussi rencontré un franc succès, que ce soit critique mais aussi commercial. Et pour preuve, selon les chiffres de ventes annoncés par Ventes Rap, ce troisième album de Dinos s'est écoulé à 23 236 équivalent ventes en première semaine.

5) Hip-Hop artist
6) House Musician from Italy
7) French Rapper
8) Techno Musician
9) Industrial Ambience, alias of Rita Mikhael
10) Alias of guitarist Jussi Kousa
11) Member of Impure Ziggurat

1)  RM real name is Kim Namjoon (Korean: 김남준; born September 12, 1994), better known as RM, is a South Korean rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is the leader and the main rapper in the South Korean boy group BTS, managed under Big Hit Labels.

**RM of BTS - Active during his pre-debut days as an underground rapper (Runch Randa). 13-year-old Nam-joon was already a prodigy in rap, he'd often attended gigs in his hometown Ilcheon and earned a place for himself in the underground scene at an early age, impressing even older underground rappers. He had made a collab with the famous rapper Zico back in 2008, the track can be found on many platforms including YouTube and SoundCloud.

In early 2015, RM earned not only the approval from big names in the Korean Hip-hop scene, but he had also gained respect from the American Hip-hop figure Warren G. The two came together for the track ""P.D.D"", where RM asks his haters to stay alive to witness his success. The west coast rapper stated in an interview with CJ America, ""I couldn’t understand all his lyrics, but I can say that it was very good because his flow, style, and rhythm are all excellent.” He then even went on to say, ""When I hear Rap Monster’s songs, it sounds like Snoop Dogg or me rapping with the beats we’ve made.” 

 On March 4, 2015, RM released a single with Warren G entitled, ""P.D.D (Please Don't Die)"" ahead of his first solo mixtape RM following an offer by Warren G to collaborate. The track reflected how RM felt towards those who hated and criticized him at the time, which he used to find very upsetting.

That same March, RM collaborated with hip hop project group MFBTY, EE and Dino J on the song ""Bucku Bucku"". He featured in the song's music video and also had a cameo appearance in a music video for another song by MFBTY, ""Bang Diggy Bang Bang"".

He released his first solo mixtape in the same year, titled 'RM'. It's a work where Namjoon discusses hip-hop's influence in his life, the hardships he'd experienced in pursuit of his career, as well as his struggle with self-love and self-acceptance. ""Awakening"", the third track of the mixtape, talked of his internal conflict between his two identities of ""rapper"" and ""idol"", as he had received backlash from the underground Hip-hop community prior to his debut with BTS, claiming that he'd betrayed his roots as a rapper. To this day, the mixtape is considered one of the best works inside the Korean Hip-Hop scene.

Following RM's release, he featured along with Kwon Jin-ah on Primary's ""U"" that April. In August, RM collaborated with Marvel for Fantastic Four's soundtrack in Korea, releasing the digital single, ""Fantastic"" featuring Mandy Ventrice. 

In August 2016, vocal duo Homme released a single titled ""Dilemma"", which was co-produced by RM and Bang Si-hyuk.

In 2017 was released the track ""Change"", a collab between Wale and Rap Monster (RM). The song talks of global violence, the school system, social injustice, and bullying. The two conversed through lyrics, claiming that people were controlled by the higher power and voiced out their wish of a changing world.

In 2018, he came out with a second mixtape named ""mono"". A project containing a few collaborations (with artists such as HONNE, NELL, eAeon) where Nam-joon experimented with lofi Hip-Hop and ballad. Though different from his previous works, he was still able to showcase his soul-deep lyricism, where he often implemented his skill of using wordplay and metaphors to further reach his listeners. With this mixtape, he continued to explore his own identity and life through a microscope, touching topics like loneliness, self-doubt, longing, and even explored the concept of love and hate. 'mono' proved RM a unique artist of diversity and growth. The mixtape is available on Spotify, iTunes, and SoundCloud. During its first day of release, the mixtape reached high positions on stream platforms, giving RM a profile with verification, resulting in his becoming of a more acknowledged rapper, producer, and songwriter.

In December, RM collaborated on a remix of Fall Out Boy's song ""Champion"". The track reached number 18 on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles and helped RM reach number 46 on the Emerging Artists Chart for the week of January 8, 2018.

In November, RM also collaborated with Tiger JK on his last and final album under the stage name Drunken Tiger, featuring on the track ""Timeless"". Tiger JK originally expected RM's lyrics to contain self-praise, which was the trend of rap at the time; RM instead wrote lyrics about leaving behind the historical meaning of Drunken Tiger's name.

A lot of prestigious artists, from South Korea and EUA, found interest in RM and invited him for collaborations. Famous American rappers like Wale and Lil Nas X, even the rock group Fall Out Boy and famous Korean artists like Drunken Tiger and Gaeko.

On December 29, it was announced that RM would feature on Younha's track ""Winter Flower"", released on January 6, 2020.

RM also featured on ""Don't"", the lead single of Korean singer eAeon's second solo album released on April 30, 2021.

BTS, on June 14 2022, announced that they will be taking a break from group activities to focus more on solo projects. RM subsequently appeared as a featured artist on the single ""Sexy Nukim"" by alt-K-pop group Balming Tiger in September,

RM released his debut solo studio album, Indigo, led by the single ""Wild Flower"", on December 2. The album peaked at number three on the Billboard 200, making him the highest-charting Korean soloist in chart history.

101,101,ilytommy,487181,8758726,"Tommelik Ward (born March 16, 2000), better known by his stage name ilyTOMMY (formerly Haroinfather), is a rapper with very catchy and melodic songs such as “princess bubblegum,” “Forever,” and “Tunnel of Love.”

Emerging in 2017 under the alias of Haroinfather, rapper Tommelik Ward debuted with a distinctly lo-fi rap sound: gloomy tracks like ""Lonely Nights"" and ""Slave to the Hurt"" were characterized by their muffled vocals, pained stories, and themes of inner turmoil. Through the early stages of 2018, the rapper tested new ideas, releasing the singer-songwriter style of ""We're All Lost"" and the confident, upbeat ""Listen."" But it was on ""She's My Lover Girl"" that the rapper would find his signature sound: converting short samples into mellow, looping production, Ward used his low-toned vocals to create one- to two-minute rap ballads, lamenting lost loves and pining after the objects of his affection. The rapper's second song in this style, the jazzier ""Princess Bubblegum,"" became one of his breakout hits and by 2021, it had received over 100 million digital streams.

After closing out the year with similar tracks like ""Mia Wallace"" and ""Table for Two,"" Ward adopted a cockier sound in the early stages of 2019, working with Savage Ga$p and Keshore for the hedonistic ""It's Only Right to Fall in Love Twice"" and dropping further tracks ""Lavagirl"" and ""PEP$I."" His creative synergy with Savage Ga$p would continue in a second major hit, the Legend of Zelda-sampling ""Tunnel of Love,"" followed by the more melancholy stylings of ""Please Pick Up"" and ""Us vs. the World."" A third major hit, ""Forever,"" arrived shortly after: with its evocative sample of Yuna's ""Lullabies,"" the track spun troubled romances and personal struggles into an intoxicating blend and soon garnered more than 100 million streams online.

Ward moved into 2020 alongside Savage Ga$p: the duo dropped ""Maybe It's for the Best,"" and the ""Tunnel of Love (Remix)"" in late 2019, before collaborating on tracks ""Like Dat"" and ""I'm Drunk and I Miss You Too"" in early 2020. A few solo tracks, including the vocally led ""Jennifer's Body,"" closed out the year before the rapper continued into 2021 with tracks ""Paris Hilton"" and ""Tinkerbell.""

He built his love-driven rap sounds on bare-bones samples and narratives of conflicted romance. His mellow approach to the genre found a major following in the early 2020s, with tracks like ""Forever"" and ""Princess Bubblegum"" racking up more than 100 million streams apiece. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/ilyTOMMY"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

102,102,kids see ghosts,908265,43674497,"KIDS SEE GHOSTS was an American hip-hop super-duo composed of musicians Kanye West and Kid Cudi. The duo released their eponymous debut album, Kids See Ghosts, on June 8, 2018, through GOOD Music.

In 2008, then-aspiring artist Kid Cudi caught the attention of rapper-producer Kanye West's A&R at the time, Plain Pat, who had initially met Cudi at a Def Jam meeting and picked up a copy of his demo. Plain Pat went on to introduce Cudi's music to West, subsequently leading West to sign Cudi to his GOOD Music imprint later that year. Following Cudi's signing to GOOD, he began heavily working with West. West first called upon Cudi to reference hooks for American rapper and mogul Jay-Z, and while in the studio Cudi and West went from working on The Blueprint 3 to West's R&B-Esque fourth solo album, 808s & Heartbreak. Cudi's assistance on the latter includes co-writing credits and/or vocals on ""Heartless"", ""Welcome to Heartbreak"", ""Paranoid"" and ""RoboCop"". Kid Cudi proved to be a prominent songwriter and featured artist on 808s & Heartbreak, with ""Paranoid"" and ""Heartless"" being released as singles respectively, while ""Welcome to Heartbreak"" charted as an album cut and peaked at number 87 on the Pop 100.

The two continued to work on Cudi's debut album Man on the Moon: The End of Day, with West serving as an executive producer. West had also produced two songs, namely ""Sky Might Fall"", as well as the Common-assisted third single ""Make Her Say"", which West is also featured on. Cudi has contributed to every West album since 808s & Heartbreak, with their 2016 effort ""Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1"", reaching the Top 40 of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. After a brief fallout, the two reconnected in late 2016, around the dissolution of West’s Saint Pablo Tour, which ended in him being hospitalized. West abruptly canceled his Saint Pablo Tour and sought hospitalization for exhaustion in November 2016. West’s only two live appearances since have both been with Cudi, who also sought mental health treatment in the fall of 2016, for performances of ""Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1"" in November 2017 and February. West, however, hasn't appeared on one of Cudi’s songs, or worked on any of his albums, since 2010's Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager. 

On April 19, 2018, West announced via Twitter that a collaborative album with Cudi would be released in June. He followed the tweet revealing the name of the group, which also serves as the title of their debut album, Kids See Ghosts. On April 22, again via Twitter, West unveiled the album artwork, which was composed by Tokyo-based artist Takashi Murakami. The duo was originally photographed with Murakami in July 2017. On April 25, West revealed the album would be accompanied by a short film, directed by Dexter Navy, a music video director notable for his collaborations with The Neighbourhood and A$AP Rocky.

On June 8, their eponymous debut album was released following a live listening party in Santa Clarita, California. Kids See Ghosts debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart with 142,000 album-equivalent units, of which 79,000 were pure album sales. It serves as West's tenth top-five album and Cudi's sixth top-five album in the United States. All seven tracks on the album debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The track ""Reborn"" managed to chart in the Top 40 of the US Hot 100, at number 39.

Cudi revealed in July 2018 that he and West planned to continue releasing music as Kids See Ghosts. ""There are some songs that we didn't use that I'm hopeful we can put out later,"" Cudi explained in an interview with Billboard. ""But the plan is to do more Kids See Ghosts albums... We just have this chemistry that's undeniable, especially when we have to fight for it with each other.""

The duo made their live debut under the moniker at Tyler, the Creator's Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival on November 11th, 2018. They performed their album in its entirety as well as West's songs ""Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1"", ""Welcome to Heartbreak"", ""Paranoid"", and ""Ghost Town"", and Cudi's single ""Pursuit of Happiness (Nightmare)"".

In 2021, Cudi contributed vocals to the songs ""Moon"" and ""Remote Control pt 2"" on West's album Donda. ""Moon"" debuted at number 17 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.

On February 12, 2022, in a note posted to Instagram, West revealed that Cudi would not be on his album Donda 2 due to his friendship with Pete Davidson. This led to a public falling out between the two artists. On April 19, exactly four years after West announced their debut album, Cudi claimed that his collaboration with West on Pusha T's song ""Rock N Roll"" would be their last, effectively ending Kids See Ghosts. On Twitter, Cudi wrote, ""I did this song a year ago when I was still cool w Kanye. I am not cool w that man. He's not my friend and I only cleared the song for Pusha cuz that's my guy. This is the last song u will hear me on w Kanye.""

On  December 15, 2023, it was revealed that Kid Cudi would be featuring on the song ""Gun To My Head"" on Kanye's collaborative album ""Vultures"" with Ty Dolla $ign. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kids+See+Ghosts"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

116,116,godsmack,1828683,48008774,"Godsmack is a hard rock band from Lawrence, Massachusetts, United States which formed in 1995. The band comprises founder, frontman and songwriter Sully Erna, guitarist Tony Rombola, bassist Robbie Merrill, and drummer Shannon Larkin. Since its formation, Godsmack has released seven studio albums, one EP, four DVDs, and one greatest hits collection. The band's latest album, ""When Legends Rise"", was released on April 27, 2018.

The band has three #1 albums (Faceless, IV, The Oracle) on the Billboard 200, four Grammy nominations, and eight #1 hits on Mainstream Rock Radio. Godsmack has sold over 19 million records worldwide.

Since its inception, Godsmack has toured on Ozzfest on more than one occasion, and have toured with many other large tours and festivals, including supporting its albums with its own arena tours. In the summer of 2009, Godsmack toured as support to Mötley Crüe's Crüe Fest 2 tour.

In February 1995, Sully Erna decided to start a new band as the lead singer after playing the drums for more than 23 years, including over two years in the now-defunct band Strip Mind.  His new band The Scam formed with Erna on vocals, Robbie Merrill on bass, local guitarist and friend Lee Richards on guitar, and Tommy Stewart on drums. The Scam quickly changed its name to Godsmack, after recording one demo.  The newly formed band started playing small bars in their hometown of Boston, Mass.. Locally popular songs such as ""Keep Away"" and ""Whatever"" soon brought them to the top of the hit charts in the Boston/New England area.

The band's name, according to Merrill in the Smack This! DVD, was taken from the Alice in Chains' song ""God Smack"". However, Erna stated in a 1999 interview that ""I was making fun of somebody who had a cold sore on his lip and the next day I had one myself and somebody said, 'It's a godsmack.' The name stuck. We were aware of the Alice in Chains song but didn't really think much about it. It's a cool song and the name had meaning for us"".

In 1996, Tony Rombola and Joe D'Arco joined Godsmack as the guitarist and drummer, after Richards left after finding out he had a six-year-old child and Stewart left due to personal differences. In the same year the band entered the studio for the first time, recording its first CD titled ""All Wound Up"". The CD was recorded in just three days for $2,600.

For the next two years, the band played throughout the Boston area. Eventually Godsmack's CD landed in the hands of Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston radio station WAAF (FM). The radio station put ""Keep Away"" into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly. Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of ""Keep Away"", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled ""Whatever"", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM).

In an interview Sully Erna stated, ""we had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of a sudden we started moving over records a week. It was insane. Even crazier, I was doing all this from my bedroom. After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off.""

Alice in Chains is believed to be the primary influence to Godsmack. Many believe Godsmack obtained their name from the Alice in Chains song ""God Smack"" off the album Dirt. In an interview with MTV upon the death of Alice in Chains lead singer Layne Staley, Godsmack frontman Sully Erna stated that Staley ""was single-handedly the guy that got me to start singing.""  Erna went on to later confirm that indeed ""God Smack"" is the inspiration for the bands name and the reason their sound sounds similar to that of Alice in Chains Other bands cited by Godsmack members as their primary influences typically include Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Rush,  Black Sabbath, ² and White Zombie. More recently, Godsmack have attempted to distance themselves from the Alice in Chains comparison with Erna stating in an interview with Matt Ashare, ""I've just never really heard that in our music."" In that same interview, Erna offers an alternative explanation to the origin of their band name by stating, ""It happened at rehearsal when our drummer came in with a big cold sore on his lip. I was making fun of him all day because we had a photo shoot coming up. And then the next day when I came in, I had a big cold sore on my lip. So my guitar player said, See, God just smacked you for making fun of him."" Nevertheless, the comparison to Alice in Chains is well documented. Sully Erna's style of singing mirrors that of Layne Staley's while the overall sound of the band's first two albums sound incredibly similar to the sound of Dirt. The logo of Godsmack is similar to the sun logo of Alice in Chains. Godsmack also released an album titled ""Faceless"" which is similar in name to Alice in Chain's first album Facelift. The band even transcended from their heavy sound to a more mellow acoustic sound on their album ""The Other Side"" in the same manner Alice in Chains did in ""Jar of Flies"".

In 2002, Godsmack received a Grammy nomination in ""Best Rock Instrumental Performance"" for the song ""Vampires"" from the album Awake. In 2004, they opened for Metallica, while headlining with Dropbox in the summer. They did acoustic shows for their newly released album The Other Side in the fall of 2004, while still opening for Metallica. In September 2004, Godsmack issued a live DVD titled ""Changes"" which the band recorded earlier that year. That same month, the group also released ""Batalla de los Tambores"", a live cut available only via online services such as Apple's iTunes Music Store, Real and Napster. They released their latest album 'The Oracle' on May 3rd, 2010.
Some songs from the album ""Faceless"" are also in the video game soundtrack for ""Prince of Persia: Warrior Within"".

117,117,ice cube,2758341,48988974,"O'Shea Jackson Sr. (born June 15, 1969), known professionally as Ice Cube, is an American rapper and actor. He began his career as a member of the hip-hop group C.I.A. and later joined the seminal rap group N.W.A (Niggaz Wit Attitudes). After leaving N.W.A in December 1989, he began both a successful solo music career and an acting career which included roles in films such as Boyz n the Hood (1991), Friday (1995), for which he also co-wrote the screenplay, and Barbershop (2002). Additionally, he has served as one of the producers of the Showtime television series Barbershop and the TBS series Are We There Yet?, both of which are based upon films in which he portrayed the main character.

Ice Cube is one of the founding artists of gangsta rap, and much of his musical output has contained harsh socio-political commentary. He was ranked number 8 on MTV's list of the 10 Greatest MCs of All Time, while fellow rapper Snoop Dogg ranked Ice Cube as one of the greatest MC of all time. AllMusic has called him one of hip-hop's best and most controversial artists, as well as ""one of rap's greatest storytellers"". In 2012, The Source ranked him number 14 on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time. In 2014, About.com ranked him number 11 on their list of the ""50 Greatest MCs of All Time""

He released his solo debut album, ""AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted,"" in 1990 to critical and commercial success, although upon its release he was accused of racism and misogyny. He has since released 1991's ""Death Certificate"", 1992's ""The Predator"", 1993's ""Lethal Injection"", 1998's ""War & Peace Vol 1 (The War Disc)"", 2000's ""War & Peace Vol 2 (The Peace Disc)"", 2006's ""Laugh Now, Cry Later"", 2008's ""Raw Footage"", and 2010's ""I Am the West.""

Ice Cube was raised in South Central by his parents, both of whom were employed at UCLA. He began writing raps while attending George Washington Preparatory High School in Westmont, California, most notably ""Boyz 'N Tha Hood"", which later became famous when done by N.W.A in 1986. Cube finished his schooling at William Howard Taft Charter High School in Woodland Hills, a predominately white neighborhood in San Fernando Valley, some 40 miles from the high-crime neighborhood where his family stayed.

Cube and a friend, Sir Jinx, rapped as a partnership called C.I.A. at parties hosted by Dr. Dre. After a brief stint in a group called ""HBO"", Cube showed Eazy-E ""Boyz 'N Da Hood,"" and the pair, plus Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, The Arabian Prince and MC Ren, formed N.W.A. 

Cube took one year off to earn a degree in architectural drafting in Phoenix in 1987 but returned in time to participate in N.W.A's debut album, Straight Outta Compton. The album attracted much notoriety for the group, from the FBI and concerned citizen and parent groups. Cube did the lead verse for the album's infamous track ""Fuck tha Police.""

Ice Cube left N.W.A due to financial and personality conflicts in 1989. With Da Lench Mob and the Bomb Squad (Public Enemy's producers), Cube recorded his debut album in New York City. AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted was released in 1990 and was an instantaneous hit as rap's popularity increased in mainstream society. 

His 1991 follow-up, Death Certificate, was even more controversial. A few songs in the album featured Cube's hate of Uncle Sam and his politics, and a bonus track named ""No Vaseline"" was a diss to his former N.W.A bandmates. Also that year, he converted to the Nation of Islam. The album was re-released in 2003 with the bonus track ""How to Survive in South Central,"" originally from the 1991 ""Boyz N the Hood"" soundtrack.

Controversy stirred about racist lyrics in his material: ""Black Korea"" (a song against Korean shopowners), referring to a former boss as ""white Jew"" in ""No Vaseline"", and songs such as ""Enemy and Cave Bitch"" (songs against ""devils"", a popular derogatory term at the time for white people). Partially to help deflect criticisms, Cube appointed a female rapper named Yo-Yo (who guested on AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted) to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, Make Way for the Motherlode. 

That was followed by Cube's acting breakout as the grown-up version of Darrin ""Doughboy"" Baker in the 1991 coming of age crime drama ""Boyz in the Hood."" Writer and director John Singleton, another LA native, penned the role specifically Cube. Ice Cube was later named ""Most Promising Actor"" at the 4th Chicago Film Critics Association Awards in 1992, beating out his co-star Cuba Gooding Jr. and newcomer Brad Pitt from ""Thelma and Louise."" 

Cube toured on Lollapalooza in 1992 and widened his fan base. He released The Predator in November (1992) which debuted at #1 on both the pop and rnb charts, the first album in history to do so. For that album, Cube decided to load some G-funk style beats which at that time was the big thing and some remix tunes which brought a new style to Cube, in which previously he had released some hardcore and extreme work. Singles from The Predator included ""Today was a Good Day"" and ""Check Yo Self (remix)"" which all had a 2 part music video.

After The Predator, Cube's audience began to diminish. Lethal Injection (1993) was not very well-liked by critics, and Dr. Dre and the West Coast G-Funk sound was dominating hip-hop. It wasn't until later that the album became popular. Taking a break from his own albums, Cube assisted on debuts from Da Lench Mob (Guerillas in the Mist) and Kam (Neva Again). He later dueted with Dr. Dre on ""Natural Born Killaz.""

Around this time in 1993, Ice Cube also worked with soon-to-be-acclaimed rapper Tupac Shakur with his album Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. and appeared on a track with 2pac.

In 1994 Ice Cube released Bootlegs & B-Sides.

During this time, hip-hop started making a transition from the West Coast Funk Hip-Hop to a more gritty East Coast hip-hop. With Mack 10 and WC, Cube formed the Westside Connection in 1996, releasing their debut album Bow Down later that year. This album was in due to Ice Cube's theory that the East Coast lacked respect for West Coast hip-hop. Songs like ""Bow Down"", and ""Gangstas Make The World Go 'Round"" make reference to this. Sales were brisk, but it did not establish a large audience. This album was later perceived as a classic, especially on the West Coast. Cube released several more solo albums; however, he is now known more for his movies than his music.

In 1998 Ice Cube released War & Peace Vol 1: The War Disc
In 2000 Ice Cube released War & Peace Vol 2: The Peace Disc
In 2003 Ice Cube along with W.C. & Mack 10 released Terrorist Threats as the West Side Connection.

In December 2004, after a long break from recording, he reached #2 in the UK singles chart with the club favourite, ""You Can Do It"" (featuring Mack 10 and Ms Toi), released as a single 5 years after it was first included on movie soundtracks such as 
Ice Cube was influenced by and took his name from African American pimp-turned-author Iceberg Slim, who published his autobiography Pimp in 1969. At one point, Ice Cube was scheduled to play the lead role in a movie adaptation of Pimp, but the project appears to be halted.

Cube's oldest son, O'Shea Jackson Jr., made his feature film debut in the 2015 N.W.A biopic ""Straight Outta Compton,"" portraying his father. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ice+Cube"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

118,118,jid,1125894,74551018,"Destin Route (b. October 31, 1990), better known by the stage name JID, is an American rapper from Zone 6, Atlanta, Georgia. He describes himself as “a soft-spoken but intricate lyricist with a cocky side.” His stage name originates from “jittery,” his grandmother’s nickname for him due to his sporadic behavior as a child.

He first appeared on the Atlanta hip-hop scene with his debut EP, DiCaprio, in 2015. Growing up, JID's first connection with music was through his parents' collection of classic funk and soul LPs. After a stint at Hampton University playing football, JID also hooked up with fellow MCs as part of the Spillage Village collective. By 2012, he had dropped out of college to focus on music, and in 2014 he headed out on what would be a productive tour with EarthGang, Bas, and Ab-Soul. Touring allowed JID to craft his skills, and a year later he recorded and dropped the DiCaprio EP, which saw him team up with a host of producers, as well as EarthGang. While keen to distance himself from the generic abrasive trap sound that had dominated the Atlanta scene, JID wanted to deliver something that was more than just about a beat, and instead focused his time and effort on lyrics as well. In 2016, JID, alongside the rest of the Spillage Village crew, released the album Bears Like This Too Much, which saw the rapper honing his unique delivery and inspired lyrics. In 2017, he announced that he had signed to J. Cole's Dreamville label (a connection made with the rapper via JID's part in the 2014 tour with Bas and Cole's friend and producer Cedric Brown), which released the single Never and full-length The Never Story at the beginning of the year. In September of 2018, he issued the single ""151 Rum,"" the first offering from DiCaprio 2, his sophomore full-length and sequel to his 2015 EP. Later that year he released the album ""Dicaprio 2"". JID released his most recent album, ""The Forever Story"" on August 26th, 2022, the two singles on the album, ""Surround Sound (feat. 21 Savage & Baby Tate)"" and ""Dance Now"" were released on January 14th 2022, and August 9th 2022 respectively. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Jid"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Uncle Murda, real name Leonard Grant, is a rapper from Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in Cypress Hills Projects. He was called L.G. (for his initials) and then onto L-Murder by people who knew him. He received his name ""Uncle Murda"" from Murda & Uncle being added by the kids in his neighborhood projects to whom he would generously give money.[1]

[edit] Musical Career

Murda started to take rap seriously in 2006 and was heavy in the underground circuit of New York City. He was linking up DJ Green Lantern and DJ Cut Master C for mixtapes but it wasn't until he released his hit single ""Bullet Bullet"" that he finally gained mainstream attention, followed by another single ""Run The City"". Uncle Murda has been known to be ""Too hard for hip hop"" because of his Hardcore lyrics about his lifestyle as a gangster living in the ghetto. He has his own rap crew named GMG which is an abbreviation for ""Getting Money Gangstas"".

In 2007, DJ Green Lantern and DJ Clue introduced Uncle Murda's music to Jay-Z. The Brooklyn born rapper/CEO signed Uncle Murda to Roc-A-Fella Records soon after. They started to promote him immediately by placing him on a track with popular label-mates Fabolous and Jay-Z for the song ""Brooklyn"" (Featured on From Nothin' to Somethin' album) and everything seemed to be going well for the rapper. However in late 2008 rumors that Uncle Murda left Def Jam came about. In an interview with DJ Vlad, Uncle Murda confirmed the rumors that he has split from Def Jam and Roc-a-fella Records[2] claiming everything went downhill since Jay-Z's departure. “I’m no longer with Def Jam,” he said. “Things didn’t work out over there once Jay-Z left it was like you know, they didn’t really know what to do with Uncle Murda after that.” Still very optimistic, the rapper goes on to say ""I’m still relevant, I'm still that man"". Uncle murder has since been removed as an artist on the def jam roster on the def jam website.

[edit] Shooting

On January 22nd, 2008, Uncle Murda was shot while in a parked car on Linden Blvd in East New York.[3] Ironically, the shooting happened after the rapper released his mixtape entitled ""Respect the Shooter"". He discharged himself from the hospital less than 24 hours after he was admitted - with the bullet still embedded in his skull. Uncle Murda called the nationally syndicated Wendy Williams Experience radio show after the shooting and told her he was using ""Hennessey and Newports"" to cope with the pain"".[4] The crime remains unsolved by police since Uncle Murda refuses to cooperate with investigators. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Uncle+Murda"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

YoungBoy started writing and making music around the age of fourteen, eventually dropping his first mixtape Life Before Fame in April of 2015.

YoungBoy started to gain recognition when he dropped his projects Mind Of A Menace 3, Before I Go, and 38 Baby, but gained the most recognition for his hit song “38 Baby.”

Shortly after the success of “38 Baby” Young Boy was arrested on November 28, 2016, and was charged with two counts of attempted second-degree murder in connection with a drive-by shooting which occurred November 7, 2016. YoungBoy ended up being sentenced to a ten-year suspended prison sentence after serving six months in prison.

After YoungBoy was released from jail, he dropped “Untouchable” which is one of his biggest hits to date. Following the release of “Untouchable,” YoungBoy released AI YoungBoy on August 4, 2017.

Later on, in 2017 YoungBoy ended the year by dropping Ain’t Too Long and started 2018 by releasing his debut studio album, Until Death Call My Name.

Nowadays YoungBoy has come up with more famous tracks such as “Drawing Symbols,” “Lil Top,” “House Arrest Tingz” and “Around”. These have appeared on albums as AI Youngboy II, Still Flexin', Still Steppin' and Top.

On March 25, 2021, the rapper was taken into custody by the FBI on an outstanding federal warrant for drug and weapon charges which date back to 2016. While locked up, YoungBoy’s team released the rapper’s third studio album, Sincerely, Kentrell, on September 24, 2021: it was originally set to be released in May of the same year. Nearly a month after, on October 22, YoungBoy was released from jail on a $500K bond and is currently placed on house arrest in Utah.

Ending 2021, YoungBoy partnered with the fellow Louisiana native, Birdman to present the two artists' joint mixtape, From The Bayou which would peak at #19 on the Billboard 200.

Beginning 2022 to a ferocious start, YoungBoy would begin to diss King Von on songs such as “Bring The Hook,” and “Fish Scale.” These songs would soon appear on YoungBoy’s eighteenth mixtape, Colors which would later peak at #2 on the Billboard 200.

Later in the year, just a month afterward, YoungBoy would find himself in a viral controversy with the Chicago native, Lil Durk as both of them exchanged brutal disses from Durk’s “AHHH HA,” to YoungBoy’s “I Hate YoungBoy” — both regarding the death of King Von.

Following his hastily start to 2022, YoungBoy would partner up with DaBaby to present the duo’s joint mixtape, BETTER THAN YOU in March. The mixtape would later peak at #10 on the Billboard 200, this would mark YoungBoy’s ninth top ten.

On April 1, 2022, continuing his victorious run, YoungBoy would release The Last Slimeto Sampler, a sample album for his August release, The Last Slimeto. This album would mark YoungBoy’s final album with Atlantic Records.

On July 15, 2022, YoungBoy was found not guilty of his federal guns charge. In a interview on Instagram, YoungBoy announced that he and his team were planning to go on tour.

As planned, on August 5, 2022, YoungBoy released The Last Slimeto which would mark his last album with Atlantic Records, completing the contract. The album would also peak at #1 on the Billboard 200 marking his fifth #1 album. The project would also break a tie with Taylor Swift as it scored a #1 album in each of the past four years.

On September 6, 2022, YoungBoy released Realer 2 as a surprise release, it is presented as a sequel to his December 2018, Realer. Just over a month following the release of Realer 2, YoungBoy released the Juvenile-influenced mixtape, 3800 Degrees which would peak at #12 on the Billboard 200. Two weeks prior to the release of 3800 Degrees, YoungBoy would release yet another mixtape hosted by DJ Drama as a part of his Gangsta Grillz series titled Ma’ I Got A Family.

Through Billboard, on October 24, 2022, it was announced that following YoungBoy’s departure from Atlantic Records, beginning 2023, he would release music under a joint venture deal between his own Never Broke Again and Motown Records. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/YoungBoy+Never+Broke+Again"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

122,122,dj khaled,2502772,49402219,"Khaled Mohammed Khaled (/ˈkælɪd/; born November 26, 1975),[3] known professionally as DJ Khaled, is an American DJ, record producer, and record executive. Originally a Miami-based radio personality, Khaled has since become known for enlisting high-profile music industry artists to perform on singles and albums, for which he often serves as hype man. His distinctions are his booming voice presence, ""motivational"" abstractions, and numerous catchphrases. While his musical contribution is often questioned, Khaled's role has been described as ""organization, direction, [and] promotion"".[4][5]

Khaled was born in New Orleans to Palestinian immigrant parents. He first gained recognition as a radio host in the 1990s for the radio station 99 Jamz, and translated his popularity by working with Fat Joe's hip hop collective, Terror Squad, as a DJ for their live performances. Following his production credits on the group's material,[6] Khaled enlisted several hip hop artists associated with the group and his native Miami to perform on his debut studio album, Listennn... the Album (2006). His second album, We the Best (2007), spawned the hit single ""I'm So Hood"" (featuring T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross and Plies). His two subsequent releases—We Global (2008) and Victory (2010)—both peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200; the latter was supported by the single ""All I Do Is Win"" (featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross), which received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

His fifth studio album and major label debut, We the Best Forever (2011), saw continued commercial success and brought Khaled to mainstream prominence by spawning his first Billboard Hot 100-top ten single, ""I'm on One"" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross and Lil Wayne). His following three albums—Kiss the Ring (2012), Suffering from Success (2013), and I Changed a Lot (2015)—were released to moderate critical and commercial reception.[7] Throughout 2015 and 2016, Khaled gained wider recognition as a public figure due to his social media activity. This, along with several Internet memes, foresaw the release of his ninth studio album, Major Key (2016), which was met with further critical and commercial success as it debuted atop the Billboard 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.

His tenth album, Grateful (2017), became his second consecutive number-one album and was preceded by the singles ""I'm the One"" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) and ""Wild Thoughts"" (featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller), which peaked at numbers one and two on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. His eleventh album, Father of Asahd (2019), contained the song ""Higher"" (featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend), which won Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards—Khaled's first Grammy Award win. His eponymous twelfth album (2021) and thirteenth album, God Did (2022), both debuted atop the Billboard 200. The latter's title track (featuring Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend and Fridayy) earned three nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance.

Outside of music, Khaled has gained success as a writer, with his book The Keys featuring on the New York Times Best Seller list. He has also performed as an actor for the films Spies in Disguise (2019) and Bad Boys for Life (2020). His record label, We the Best Music Group has distributed his releases since its formation in 2008, though Khaled signed other artists to the imprint including Ace Hood, Kent Jones, Mavado, Flipp Dinero, and Vado, among others. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Khaled"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Polo G was originally known for his Chicago drill sound, but eventually transitioned to a more melodic style. He has been noted for his ""vivid and explicit storytelling""; his lyrics often involve tough subjects, including racism and mental health.

He also grew up listening to Gucci Mane, as well as Chicago rappers Lil Durk, G Herbo and Chief Keef.

They’ve independently published several EPs, singles, and videos online, where their music can be streamed on all the major sites including Apple Music, Google Play, Spotify, SoundCloud, and Tidal.  Their music has gained wide fan recognition on YouTube, where their posted songs and videos have over 6 million views. Over 1 million visitors respectively have listened to “Prime” and “The Drum” on the site. Taz and Goon, both self-described health freaks, are also known for sharing their workout playlist on Spotify with their social media followers and on their website.

The Seige has performed at SXSW in Austin, Texas, as well as the iconic Whisky A Go-Go in Los Angeles, among many other venues.  They’ve also collaborated on several song and video projects with pop sensations Cheat Codes, including “Natalie Portman” and “Monsters Are Everywhere”.

The group has had its work featured in major commercial, video game, and movie projects as well. When the Cleveland Cavaliers set out to announce their new team uniform design in 2017, they included The Seige’s song “Animal” on their video. Popular VLOGGER Logan Paul used “The Drum” on several of his posts in 2017, and that same song was used in commercials done by Under Armour, the Detroit Lions, Verizon Wireless, and Marvel Studios. The group’s music has been included in movie trailers such as 12 Strong and 50 Shades Darker, as well as some major video game trailers including Fortnite, Elex, and Fifa 18.

Most recently, their music was highlighted on MTV’s The Challenge: Vendettas, on which the group was also cited as a featured artist.

Merging the words SEIZE and SIEGE, The Seige hopes to grasp people’s attention and barrage them with a strong message of positivity that can help overcome negative thoughts and promote healthy perspectives on life.  Ultimately, the duo is driven to create musical experiences that can motivate and inspire people to reach their fullest potential and not be constrained by the limits the world tries to impose.  For them, it’s all about the impact their music can have, one person at a time.  That mission infuses the vocal and rhythmic push of their in-your-face style, a demand to wake up, pay attention, and empower yourself to achieve and succeed. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Seige"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

137,137,wiz khalifa,3400126,70254712,"Cameron Jibril Thomaz (born September 8, 1987 in Minot, North Dakota), better known by his stage name Wiz Khalifa, is an American rapper based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, signed to Rostrum Records. According to the Black and Yellow Songfacts, his stage name is derived from khalifa, an Arabic word meaning ""successor"", and wisdom. His nickname growing up was ""Wizard"" which was shortened to Wiz when Khalifa was fifteen.

In 2005 he released his first official mixtape, Prince of the City: Welcome to Pistolvania, and later in 2006 he released his first full length street album entitled Show and Prove. Since then he has released a further six mixtapes and a collaboration mixtape titled How Fly with friend Curren$y. He released his debut album, Deal or No Deal, in November of 2009, it reached #1 on the iTunes hip hop chart, and then reached the top ten on iTunes' overall album chart the week it was released. Previously signed to Warner Bros. Records, he left the label in July 2009 after numerous delays in releasing his planned debut album for the label, First Flight. Khalifa stated to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that, ""I learned a lot during my time there and matured as an artist during the process. I'm happy to be moving on with all of my material and having the chance to be in control of my next moves"".He is also the founder of the rap crew Taylor Gang, which includes friends Kev Tha Hustler, Ekko, Smallz Money and Gene Stovall. They derived the name from the fact they always used to wear Chuck Taylor shoes.

Khalifa was born on September 8, 1987 in Minot, North Dakota to a mother and a father serving in the military. The family moved to Pittsburgh when Khalifa was the age of two. His parents' military service caused the family to move on a regular basis. 
Over the next thirteen years, he would move between Pittsburgh and South Carolina, Georgia, Oklahoma, Germany, Japan, and England as his parents were reassigned to different posts. In October of 1990 Wiz was separated from his mother,who left him in the hands of her sister while she served in Operation Desert Storm.

During his travels, Wiz was forced to mature quicker than his peers. He was constantly faced with new surroundings, new schools, and new sets of friends, and he found it difficult to become attached to anyone outside his family roots. This nomadic life gave Wiz an opportunity, though, to broaden his mind and offered him many experiences from which to draw inspiration. He began to perceive the world differently than most kids, and he would write his thoughts down every day.These thoughts would become the foundation for his future recordings.

By the age of 14, with a few songs under his belt, Wiz was already drawing comparisons with his commanding voice and witty wordplay. While he has been influenced by artists such as Jay-Z, Camron, and the Notorious B.I.G., Wiz was determined to create his own identity that would, one day, be loved and revered by fans.

Ready to take the next step, Wiz began his search for a recording studio to record new songs. He found one, ID LABS, where owner Eric Dan immediately recognized Wiz's talents. Along with Chad Glick of ID Management, they began to network Wiz to another Pittsburgh native, Benjy Grinberg of Rostrum Records. Benjy realized the raw talent that Wiz possessed, and immediately brought him into the Rostrum family in 2002.

Soon after, Wiz Khalifa began his ascent into the music scene in the Pittsburgh area. He has been hailed by the award winning Pittsburgh Post-Gazette pop music critic, Ed Masley, as having “the skills, the looks, the confidence, the drive, and the charisma for the job.” The New Pittsburgh Courier says, “The combination of a young, charismatic M.C. with a slew of stop-and-rewind rhymes together with a local independent label with major industry connections has set the stage for a hip-hop artist representing Pittsburgh to reach superstar status for the first time ever.

In 2010, with the success of Kush and Orange Juice still present, Wiz Khalifa signed with Atlantic Records. Wiz's style along with his production team, Johnny Juliano, Sledgren, and E. Dan make this a winning combination for success. 

He is also well known for his debut single for Atlantic, ""Black and Yellow"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. His debut album for the label, Rolling Papers, was released on March 29, 2011. He followed that album with O.N.I.F.C. (abbreviated for mainstream markets from ""Only Nigga In First Class"") on December 4, 2012 which was backed by the singles ""Work Hard, Play Hard"" and ""Remember You"". O.N.I.F.C. debuted at number two with 131,000 in first week sales.

Pittsburgh City Council declared 12-12-12 (December 12, 2012) to be Wiz Khalifa Day in the city. Khalifa graduated from Pittsburgh's Taylor Allderdice High School and in January 2012, purchased a home in nearby Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.

In April 2013, Khalifa revealed that after having his son he decided to work on a new album that he was planning to release in 2013. On April 17, 2013, Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y announced that they will drop their collaboration EP Live in Concert on April 20, 2013. The EP featured seven new songs. On June 24, 2013, he announced that his fifth studio album would be titled Blacc Hollywood and would be released in 2013. On September 3, 2013, Khalifa revealed he had recorded songs with Miley Cyrus, Adele and Juicy J for Blacc Hollywood. In October 2013, Mannie Fresh confirmed that he provided production for the album. On February 11, 2014, Khalifa released Blacc Hollywood's first single titled ""We Dem Boyz"". The album was then supported by the singles ""KK"", ""You and Your Friends"", ""Stayin Out All Night"", ""Promises"" and ""So High"". 

Khalifa released an EP with TY Dolla $ign on March 31, 2015, entitled ""Talk About It In the Morning"". That same month, Wiz released the lead single for the film ""Furious 7"" called ""See You Again"" as a tribute to Paul Walker. The single has since gone on to global success. ""See You Again"" spent 12 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, tying for the longest-running rap number-one hit in the US. 

On January 23, 2015, Khalifa was featured on a remix release of the Fall Out Boy song ""Uma Thurman"". On May 18, they performed the song together on the 2015 Billboard Music Awards show. In the summer of 2015, he began touring the United States with Fall Out Boy and Hoodie Allen in a tour titled ""The Boys of Zummer Tour"". The tour featured performances of ""Uma Thurman"" by Fall Out Boy and Khalifa. Later that year, on December 15, 2015, Wiz released the mixtape ""Cabin Fever 3"". During the Golden Globes on January 10, 2016, Wiz announced that his next album, titled Khalifa, would be released on the 22nd of that month. However, the album was released on February 5, 2016. On May 24, 2016, he released ""Pull Up"", a standalone single in promotion of his sixth album, Rolling Papers 2, which was released on July 13, 2018.

On April 20, 2020, Khalifa released, The Saga of Wiz Khalifa. The album included collaborations with Tyga, Logic, Mustard and Ty Dolla $ign. In May 2020, Khalifa featured on the song ""Drums Drums Drums"" with Travis Barker.

In 2021, Khalifa competed in season five of The Masked Singer as ""Chameleon"". He finished in third place. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Wiz+Khalifa"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

145,145,the alchemist,1188947,38061247,"Alan Daniel Maman (born October 25, 1977), better known as The Alchemist, is a hip-hop producer and MC. The Alchemist has been an active producer since 1991. He hails from affluent Beverly Hills, California. After rising to prominence in the late 1990s as a close associate of Dilated Peoples, he went on to produce for many of hip-hop's leading artists in the 2000s.

As a teen, Al began to identify strongly with the rebellious lyrics and urban sounds of hip-hop, and he began writing his own lyrics as a creative outlet. He joined up with other like-minded artists who wrote lyrics and rebelled strongly against their ""uptight"" suburban surroundings, among whom were Shifty Shellshock of Crazy Town, Evidence of Dilated Peoples and Scott Caan, son of James Caan. They would often hang out in urban areas of Los Angeles and participated in typical teenage rebellious activities like partying, smoking marijuana, and general mischief.

Al and Scott decided to become a duo named The Whooliganz. While rhyming at a party in L.A., they attracted the attention of B-Real of Cypress Hill. He invited the teens to join his crew, The Soul Assassins, which also included the groups House of Pain and Funkdoobiest. In 1993, the Whooliganz released their first single, ""Put Your Handz Up."" The song received little radio airplay and their record label, Tommy Boy Records, decided to shelve their album. Rejected, Scott focused his creative energy on acting while Al became interested in process of making hip-hop beats.

DJ Muggs took Al under his wing and taught him how to use a sampler and mixing board. After helping to produce a few tracks for Cypress Hill, Al became the main producer for his childhood friend, Evidence and his group Dilated Peoples. When Dilated debuted in 1998, they were an underground sensation creating a huge buzz about the man behind those incredible beats.

In 1999, Muggs introduced Al to his good friends, the popular hip-hop group Mobb Deep. Al produced two songs for their Murda Muzik album. Impressed by his production skills and street smarts, Mobb Deep took him under their wing, using his beats on all their subsequent albums. As Alchemist's profile increased, he went on to produce for many of hip hop's most successful and prominent artists, such as Nas, Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Ghostface Killah and Snoop Dogg. He has also remixed songs for bands and artists in other genres such as Linkin Park and Morcheeba. Al stayed loyal to his old friends, continuing to produce for Dilated, Cypress Hill, Everlast (formerly of House of Pain) and Crazy Town. He also enjoys producing for lesser-known underground rappers, often giving them some of his best beats. In 2004, 11 years after his rapping career folded, The Alchemist returned with his long-awaited debut album, ""1st Infantry."" The album yielded the hit single ""Hold You Down"" (featuring Prodigy, Illa Ghee, and Nina Sky), which hit number ninety-five on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2005.

Alchemist was the official tour DJ for Eminem on his 2005 Anger Management 3 Tour, replacing the recently-ousted DJ Green Lantern. However on July 13, 2005, the tour bus carrying Eminem's entourage (including rapper Stat Quo as well as Alchemist) swerved off the road and turned over. Alchemist was treated for broken ribs and a collapsed lung.

The Alchemist is one of the music producers behind the video game Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars released by Rockstar Games. He was also on Tim Westwood TV, when Eminem, Royce Da 5'9"" and Mr. Porter freestyled. During an interview with Worldwide Conspiracy Radio, The Alchemist revealed he would be dropping a 2-part project with fellow West Coast producer Oh No entitled Gangrene, the first to be released in July, the second in November, both on Decon. Alchemist was also the DJ for the Eminem set on the BBC1 chat-show Jonathan Ross on June 4, 2010.

Alchemist is Eminem's official DJ, since DJ Green Lantern departed from Shady Records in 2005 because of a dispute related to the feud of 50 Cent and Jadakiss. In 2006, Eminem released a collaboration album with Shady Records called Eminem Presents: The Re-Up. Since the Alchemist is his official DJ, he produced some of the tracks on the mixtape, as well as compiling the album in a mixtape fashion. On December 18, 2013, he was named the runner-up for Producer of the Year by HipHopDX. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Alchemist"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

""Nobody needs to write a bio for me. This is stupid. My name is SAINt JHN, that's my real name, it's spelled a little different tho. I'm from Brooklyn, I spent half of my childhood growing up in Georgetown, Guyana. I was dirt poor in Brooklyn and some version of rich in Guyana, because apparently 2 nickles can buy you a sports car in a 3rd world country. Who knew?! I'm from a SUPER Christian household where my mom forced us to go to every church imaginable, EVERY, SINGLE, WEEK! I hated it. I still won't go to church to this day. I'm a product of a father that was a hustler, preacher for a mother and a rapper for an older brother. Jay z and Beenie Man were my musical hero's growing up. I don't know how to describe the music I make, don't know what genre it belongs to and I don't exactly care. I make what I want to hear and paint the pictures that I want to see in the world. I got my start writing songs for other people, I got lucky I don't know how that happened but I did. I wrote some records for Usher, Kiesza, Gorgon City and a few other people. I was having success, but then I quit, cause who wants to live their dreams through someone else's eyes. So I put out my first project, Collection One. And here we are now, I hope you like whatever comes next cause I have no fvcking idea!""

A collision of feelings, ideas, and misty ambiance, SAINt JHN's music is a living mosaic. Pulling from his dual upbringing in Guyana and Brooklyn, he swirls themes of love, joy and sorrow with emotive R&B, Hip-Hop and Afrofusion into an inimitable kaleidoscope of sounds and sensations. You could call it genre-fluid but it's easier to say it's SAINt JHN, a singer-songwriter and model who has earned two Grammy Awards and a global fan base while becoming one of the most distinct voices in the world of music.

148,148,moro,16912,304889,"Moro is one of two artists:

1) Hardcore arranger, principal arranger of KINZOK ON from Japan.
Also known as morrrrrro
KINZOK ON bandcamp: https://kinzokon.bandcamp.com/music
MORO on Twitter: https://twitter.com/moro_108


2) Moro is a beast composed of two reasonably-sentient beings: Nolan Thomas and Daniel Lee Ruff Smith, and born in the hills surrounding a village known as Eau Claire, WI. The beast is sometimes called ""M o r o"", or ""M O R O"" by different tribes.

After writhing in front of crowds of jubilant townsfolk a few times, and Lee Ruff taking a brief absence to travel to the Land of Thais, it regurgitated it's first offspring-- ""Embers""-- in a fiery cough. The townsfolk went mad for it, but it was too jittery to stay in one place, so it travelled throughout the globe on the back of the root-god Pando, whom some know as The Interwebs, among other names. The child was aided in it's travels by MJMJ Records and many friends.

Then Lee Ruff heard callings from afar, and split from it's Nolan-half to gain knowledge in the far off land of España for one half an earth cycle. Though less powerful due to their separation, the two beings were able to communicate with the aid of their friend-god Pando, speaking into his roots and sensing the vibrations on the other end. 

With a seed planted in their minds by the ancient tree-and-worker guardians, Simon & Garfunkel, they combined their powers and dreamed into existence their second child, ""Sound of Silence"". This child was requested of them by the Pando-rider Cactus-Mouth, who then took it forth along the roots and raised it as his own. 

It was then that Nolan-half began to feel unsatisfied with his choice to study the ancient and time-honored craft of Illustration, and made leave from the temple of UW-Eau Claire, at least for a time. With his newfound freedom and an approaching 21st birth-festival, his mother, Keli, offered forth the means for Nolan-half to visit the city København, in the realm of Danmark-- close to the Witch Woods of Sverige, where the Old Gods dwell. He sought refuge with his pal-being Mirko, and stayed in the living room of two wonderful she-Danes. 

By some chance of fate, Lee Ruff was also in the region, and the two beings were able to briefly reunite in the north-country of Uppsala, deep within the Witch Woods of Sverige. It was a long and perilous journey for Nolan-half, battling Sex-Trolls and SJ Railways, and his ability to communicate with Pando grew weak, causing many confusions. But through it all, he eventually found the Lee Ruff, and all was merry. Moro stomped as one through the halls of Upsalla by day, and gazed into it's clear pools by night, discussing with reasonable-sentience the nature of The Creator or The Great Unknown. Cats and ducks came to listen in and gain knowledge, but were keen to hide their own sentience. 

Alas, Moro was forced to split once again, returning to Eau Claire and España respectively. Nolan-half used up all his coins on food and travel in Danmark and Sverige, and now really really needs to get a job.

The two halves of Moro have resolved to sleep until June of the earth-cycle 2011, when they can be reunited once more in the village Eau Claire, and writhe for crowds and spew forth new offspring, and send them forth into the world with Pando and alive with Moro's magical instruments, and travel throughout the land with village-friends and make many many anew. The beast will be unstoppable. maybe. It will never stop dreaming.

157,157,disturbed,3135652,139411250,"Disturbed is an American metal/hard rock band from Chicago, Illinois, formed in 1994. The band includes vocalist David Draiman, bassist John Moyer, guitarist/keyboardist Dan Donegan, and drummer Mike Wengren. Former band members are vocalist Erich Awalt and bassist Steve Kmak.

The band has released six studio albums, five of which have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Disturbed went into hiatus in October 2011, during which the band's members focused on various side projects, and returned in June 2015, releasing their first album in four years, Immortalized, on August 21, 2015. They also recorded and released one live album, Disturbed: Live at Red Rocks on November 18, 2016, which was recorded on August 18, 2016 at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, Colorado, located about 10 miles west of Denver, Colorado. Their seventh studio album, Evolution, was released on October 19, 2018.

Before David Draiman joined Disturbed, guitarist Dan Donegan, drummer Mike Wengren, and bassist Steve ""Fuzz"" Kmak were in a band called Brawl with vocalist Erich Awalt. Before changing their name to ""Brawl"", however, Donegan mentioned in the band's DVD, Decade of Disturbed, that the name was originally going to be ""Crawl""; they switched it to ""Brawl"", due to the name already being used by another band. Awalt left the band shortly after the recording of a demo tape; the other three members advertised for a singer. They posted an advertisement in the local music publication in Chicago, Illinois, called the ""Illinois Entertainer"". Draiman answered the advertisement after going to twenty other auditions that month. Guitarist Dan Donegan commented on Draiman: ""You know, out of all the singers that we had talked to or auditioned, he [Draiman] was the only singer who was ready to go with originals. And that impressed me, just to attempt that"".

With regard to Draiman being the singer for the band, Donegan said, ""After a minute or two, he just starts banging out these melodies that were huge...I'm playing my guitar and I'm grinning from ear to ear, trying not to give it away that I like this guy, you know, because I don't want to, you know...[say] 'Yeah, we'll give you a call back. We'll, you know, discuss it.' But I was so psyched. Chill up my spine. I'm like, 'There is something here.'"" As drummer Mike Wengren commented, ""We clicked right off the bat."" Draiman then joined the band in 1996 and the band was renamed Disturbed. When asked in an interview why he suggested to name the band ""Disturbed,"" Draiman said, ""It had been a name I have been contemplating for a band for years. It just seems to symbolize everything we were feeling at the time. The level of conformity that people are forced into was disturbing to us and we were just trying to push the envelope and the name just sorta made sense.

Disturbed headlined the 2018 Rock Fest, along with Godsmack and Incubus. The band announced via social media in early January of 2018 that they had entered the studio to begin recording their next studio album. In June 2018 lead guitarist Dan Donegan and bassist John Moyer confirmed with sources that the new album is complete, with 100% of the songs finished it is on to just mixing and mastering. Band members also posted a picture via Instagram together at a dinner party in celebration of completion of the recording process. The band's first album in over 3 years and the band’s first album in over 8 years to have bassist John Moyer being involved in.

The album, Evolution was released on October 19, 2018. On August 16, 2018, the lead single, titled ""Are You Ready"" was released. On September 21, 2018, the album's second single, titled ""A Reason to Fight"" was released.

Disturbed's mascot, named ""The Guy"", was originally just a drawing of a face with a large grin, as seen on the back of the album The Sickness. The original drawing of The Guy was then edited using a digital distorting program. After the original image had been distorted three times The Guy became the official mascot for the band. Later, he would be drawn as a full figure by artist David Finch.

Classified as a heavy metal or hard rock band, Disturbed is also regarded by some critics as nu metal and alternative metal. When asked about die-hard heavy metal fans not finding Disturbed heavy enough, Draiman at one time stated:

""We probably have too much melody going on or we're not quite as turbulent or caustic. While I really love that type of music, it's not what we try to do. If we have to place things in context, we're more hard rock than heavy metal these days. The secret is that we were never really part of any particular trend, although we definitely benefited from the popularity of what was called nu metal at the time ... We never had the stereotypical attributes that those bands had. We don’t rap; there’s no turntable involved; no fusion in that respect. We play, in my opinion, classic metal. Sabbath, Maiden, Priest, Metallica, Pantera: these are the bands that made us want to play.""

They have often cited their influences as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Metallica, Pantera, Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin, Queensryche, Nirvana, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden.

Guitarist Dan Donegan uses guitar tunings Drop C, Drop C# and Drop B (also occasionally Eb), which are lower tunings than regular E standard. These lower tunings allow for a heavier sound and quicker chord changes in Donegan's riffs. Donegan also uses subtle electronic effects, which the rest of the band refers to as ""The Danny Donegan Orchestra"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Disturbed"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Thug grew to prominence in 2013 after releasing his mixtape 1017 Thug to positive critical reception. He has collaborated with artists such as Gucci Mane, Young Scooter, Rich Homie Quan and Waka Flocka Flame.

Thug was born amongst the masses eliminating any doubt that he wouldn’t be special. The second youngest child of 11 children developed a skill for standing out amongst many, early. Young Thug moved to Jonesboro, an impoverished suburb of Georgia where his lifestyle was engrossed by the crime, drug addiction and violence that surrounded him. It was there that he developed an insatiable appetite to succeed his current situation. After discovering and acknowledging his talent and creativity for music in  2010, Thug started a new hustle that would soon mature as one of the most promising music careers in the South. He also founded the record label YSL ( Young Stoner/Slatt Life) in 2010.


Eyeballing the throne of Hip hop royalty, Young Thug began to create a sound and style that would inevitably place him on top. Young Thug’s catchy verses and raw lyrical talent distinguished noise from art, clearly being the latter his creations are the best that remain of Southern hip hop. He is the embodiment of the evolution of Southern hip-hop. Young Thug is the representative for a generation that doesn't see hip-hop as a hobby but a lifestyle. Keeping true to himself, his art, and his home Young Thug will stand alone as the one true savior of the Southern movement. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Young+Thug"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

169,169,$uicideboy$,1272400,340153390,"$uicideboy$ are an American hip-hop duo from New Orleans, Louisiana, founded in 2014 by cousins Ruby da Cherry and $crim. Via the music sharing platform SoundCloud, the duo rose to popularity for their abrasive, self-produced beats, as well as their harsh lyrical content and themes prominently featuring substance use disorder and suicidal ideation. The duo are considered one of the most popular artists in the underground rap scene. They own and operate their own label, G*59 Records, under which all of their music is signed. 

The music of $uicideBoy$ varies between different sub-genres of rap; while some songs have melancholy tones with lyrical content that focuses on subjects such as depression and suicidal ideation (topics not widely exposed in rap music), others are wildly aggressive, with themes of violence and sexual content. Some of their music is based around life growing up in New Orleans; song titles such as Audubon, Tulane, Elysian Fields and St. Bernard reflect streets and neighborhoods that influenced the life of Arceneaux and Petrou. A large portion of their music focuses on depression and its symptoms, an angle not often received in mainstream hip hop; Arceneaux elaborated on this in an interview with Mass Appeal, stating, “A lot of people take it as emo, or depressed music, or negative music... it’s really just connecting. It’s therapy, through music"". Excluding occasional guest producers, the entirety of Suicideboys' discography is self-produced, mainly by Arceneaux under his pseudonym Budd Dwyer (an homage to the former politician of the same name).

$crim was born Scott Arceneaux Jr. on April 11, 1989 in Marrero, Louisiana. Arceneaux originally was inspired by T-Pain and Kanye West to produce music, buying his first laptop which he used to start DJing with money gained from selling drugs. Arceneaux's passion for DJing extended when he started to attend Delgado Community College, where he was hired to DJ parties. He also worked selling used furniture, getting fired for his new hand tattoos after three years.

Ruby da Cherry was born Aristos Petrou (Αρίστος Πέτρου) on April 22, 1990 to an American mother and Greek Cypriot father. Raised in Metairie, Louisiana, Petrou's interest in music began when he was seven, playing violin and then drums when he was ten, eventually joining bands in middle school. He worked at his father's restaurant as a waiter, a job he held until 2015. His experience with the punk rock scene continued as he joined the band Vapo-Rats as its drummer; however, disillusioned with the apathy his bandmates showed towards the future of the band, Petrou left in order to pursue a career in hip-hop with Arceneaux.

Arceneaux and Petrou are cousins, and as such shared a close relationship growing up. Realising that both were interested in taking a musical career seriously, and both dissatisfied with the direction of their lives, the two formed Suicideboys, making a pact that if their musical career didn’t work out, they would both commit suicide. Elaborating on this in an interview with Mass Appeal, Arceneaux states that, “it was pretty much like cutting the hand, bleeding, and making a pact that there’s no plan B, that if this doesn’t happen by the time we’re 30, I’m blowing my head off”.

The duo's first project together, a three-track EP named Kill Yourself Part I: The $uicide $aga, was released in June 2014 on SoundCloud and Bandcamp, attracting attention for their collaboration with notable underground rapper Bones. In the following months, the duo released a further nine iterations of the Kill Yourself series. After a number of collaboration EPs with fellow underground artist Black Smurf, their first full length project titled Gray/Grey was released on March 3, 2015.

Suicideboys' underground breakthrough came with the release of 2015 EP $outh $ide $uicide, a collaboration with established South Florida rapper Pouya, which thrust the duo into the underground rap spotlight. Other 2015 releases include 7th or St. Tammany, YUNGDEATHLILLIFE, High Tide in the Snake's Nest, Grey Sheep EP, I No Longer Fear The Razor Guarding My Heel (part I and II), My Liver Will Handle What My Heart Can't, Now The Moon's Rising and G.R.E.Y.G.O.D.S. with fellow g59 rapper RAMIREZ.

 The duo's first foray onto the mainstream musical charts came with the release of Radical $uicide in the summer of 2016. The five-track EP, produced by EDM musician Getter, peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Rap charts. Other 2016 releases include Dark Side of the Clouds, Grey Sheep II, Eternal Grey, I No Longer Fear The Razor Guarding My Heel (part III), G.R.E.Y.G.O.D.S.I.I. with [artis]RAMIREZ, DIRTYNASTY$UICIDE with GERM, and Black $uicide Side C with Black Smurf.

In 2017 the boys released another 10 iterations of the Kill Yourself series, they also dropped DIRTIERNASTIER$UICIDE, with GERM.

On September 7, 2018, their debut studio album I Want to Die in New Orleans was released. A statement posted by the duo's official Instagram account stated, ""We started recording this album in the beginning of 2017. Initially we wanted to write about our experiences on the road and express how our lives had become slightly more extravagant.""

In late 2018, a rumor arose that the group had broken up following a series of ominous tweets. However, they soon clarified that the tweets were in relation to ""personal issues"" facing Arceneaux, and that they had in fact not broken up. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/$uicideboy$"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He also began recording a rock music album, Crunk Rock; in May 2006 he began recording in Las Vegas, Nevada because rock band The Killers was recording its upcoming album Sam's Town there.

MTV News reported in March 2008 that Crunk Rock was taking more time to complete than Lil' Jon already planned. As part of TVT Records' 2008 bankruptcy auction, Lil' Jon withdrew his multi-million dollar objection to the TVT sale proceedings and agreed to TVT’s transfer of his artist agreement to The Orchard. In return, The Orchard released Lil' Jon from all future obligations and returned the rights to the master recordings of Crunk Rock.

He has released three studio albums and recorded with artists from a diverse range of musical genres throughout his career.

Born in Medellín and raised primarily in Miami, Yatra began singing at a young age and returned to Colombia to begin his musical career. He achieved breakout success with ""Traicionera"" followed by ""Robarte un Beso"" featuring Carlos Vives.

Despite growing up in Florida and being fluent in English, Yatra sings almost exclusively in Spanish. Yatra explains, “My goal was always to be a singer in Spanish. And I really wanted to understand where I come from and live it. A lot of times I went to Colombia and, even though I spoke Spanish and was always speaking Spanish with my parents, I still felt like an outsider. I wasn’t 100 percent part of it. I wanted to give my roots the importance they deserve. ”His June 2019 song ""Runaway"" was his first foray into bilingual songwriting. In December 2019, he collaborated with South Korean boy group Monsta X for the song ""Magnetic"", which features verses from Yatra in Spanish and a bridge from Monsta X in Spanglish.

El mayor tiene solo 26 años y el menor 21. Son jóvenes, sí, pero ya son conscientes de su éxito y más que un grupo, ellos se consideran una familia, pues lo más importante, antes de cantar, es la unión y la lealtad a su amistad.

Todo comenzó en junio del año 2007 cuando se conocieron en un asado que organizó un amigo que tenían en común. Conversando se dieron cuenta de que los cuatro eran músicos y terminaron cantando hasta las 6 de la mañana.

Días después El Profe buscó a Dim y al Llanero y les propuso formar un grupo, pero Dim dijo que sí con la condición de que también incluyeran a Pablito, quien estaba de viaje en ese momento en Contadora, Panamá.

Fue tanta la emoción y la ansiedad por crear el grupo que inmediatamente llamaron a Pablito a Panamá y el aceptó sin dudarlo.

Paso a paso
Su segundo encuentro, o mejor dicho su primer ensayo, fue en el club house de un amigo del edificio San Mitchel, en el piso 21, desde donde se podía ver la ciudad d medellin completa. Este se convirtió durante varios meses en su ensayadero oficial y era allí donde pasaban noches enteras montando las canciones.

""Durante esas noches soñábamos con que algún día escucharían nuestras composiciones en todas esas casa que veíamos desde allá"", cuenta Dim.

""Y creo que lo estamos logrando, pero ahora la idea es que también nos escuchen en aquellas de las que solo veíamos la luz, arriba en las montañas"", continúa El Profe.

Su nombre
A la hora de pensar en cómo se llamarían, dieron muchas vueltas y hasta lo consultaron con sus familias y sus profesores.

Al principio le buscaron por el lado de sus iniciales o pensaron en jugar un poco con los nombres de David y Pablo, pero luego de intentarlo por muchos lados, se les ocurrió Piso 21, pues fue a esta altura donde realmente conformaron el grupo.

Pero a este nombre también le han encontrado una metáfora, pues según ellos, indica que para arriba es adonde quieren llegar, dando pasos lentos, pero seguros y muy largos.

Precisamente antes de empezar cada concierto, el grupo se reúne para gritar su frase favorita ""Piso 21, vamos pa'arriba papá"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Piso+21"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This all led up to her decision to make the biggest and riskiest move of her life, and that was to move to the United States. She settled in the Bronx, New York, or “the City of the Dreams and Dreamers” for young, aspiring musicians like her at the time.

Natti would continue to make big career moves throughout the years including her departure from Don Omar’s record label and signing onto Pina Records in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2017 when her big breakout would come once and for all.

2019 saw the release of her much-anticipated debut album, “ilumiNATTI,” on February 15. 15 tracks made up the project with two collaborations in total, “Te Lo Dije'' with Anitta and “Soy Mía” with Kany García. Standout track “La Mejor Version de Mi” would transform into a bachata hit with its remix featuring bachata king Romeo Santos.

Natti’s sophomore album titled “NATTIVIDAD” would be released two years later on September 24, 2021 with 17 tracks featuring several chart-topping collaborators such as Becky G, Maluma, and Prince Royce. The release was followed up by the six-episode docuseries titled “Everybody Loves Natti” which documented her pregnancy and relationship with fiancé Raphy Pina. The series premiered on November 19, 2021 on Amazon Prime Video and was generally well received. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Natti+Natasha"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

52,52,plan b,1077240,22335686,"There are several artists and bands with this name:

1) Plan B (real name Ben Drew, b. 1983) is a rapper from Forest Gate, London. From the age of 11 he attended Anglo European School in Ingatestone Essex, before transfering to Tom Hood, an inner-city comprehensive. He has described his character, in these school days, as ""a bit of a cunt"". He is signed to 679 Recordings, home to UK rap act The Streets. His unique sound is characterised by his use of acoustic beats and lyrics involving drugs, rape, murder and underage sex. He was placed fourth in the BBC's ""Sound of 2006"" competition.

His second album was released in April 2010; The Defamation of Strickland Banks was released on 12 April 2010. The album is a departure from the sound heard on Plan B's debut album Who Needs Actions When You Got Words, with the rapper's sophomore effort showcasing much more of his singing ability. Lyrically the album's songs tell the fictitious tale of one Strickland Banks, a sharp-suited British soul singer who finds fame with bitter-sweet love songs like the album's opener ""Love Goes Down"", but then loses everything when he ends up in prison for a crime he didn't commit.

The album was a great success, reaching #1 in the UK album charts, and three singles from the album reached the top 20 of the UK singles charts, with 'Stay Too Long' reaching #9 and 'She Said' reaching #3.

The Ill Manors Songfacts reports that on March 23, 2012 Plan B released “Ill Manors,” the title track of the soundtrack to the British film of the same title, which he wrote and directed.

2) Plan B (real name James van Leuven) is a producer/musician from Seattle, WA. On Like a Ship Sailing, Plan B's James van Leuven steps beyond his drumming for Automaton and allows percussion to be the focus. Laying a foundation of trip-hop beats, van Leuven (who handles nearly all of the instrumentation) implements sampling and crawly guitars and bass. The record possesses the darker atmospheres of trip-hop but without the accompanying vocals. There's also a spy film aura that permeates much of the album. Sometimes it gets a little too dark with the disturbing line, ""Howard just said he was going to blow his brains out next Tuesday."" It's balanced by a child asking, ""Have you ever been in love?,"" in ""Love,"" which flirts with breakbeats. ""Come out Strong"" has a finger-snapping cool jazz vibe with trumpet from Bill Jones. This project might be ""plan B"" for van Leuven, but his great job with live percussion makes it grade-A post-rock.

After the release of 2 LPs in 2002 and 2006 + 1 EP in 2003, Plan B Seattle was over-shadowed by the pop success of the british Plan B Ben Drew in 2006.  Since then Plan B Seattle has stopped releasing music under this moniker.

Cazzu es una artista de música urbana que se caracteriza por haber sido siempre muy voluble. Ha trabajado muchos estilos durante toda su carrera, pero encontró en el trap y el reguetón su verdadero lenguaje. El trap es por definición un compendio de géneros aglutinados, y Cazzu conoce perfectamente todos y cada uno de ellos.


La trapera estudió cine, y su conocimiento de la estética visual le ha ayudado mucho a la hora de conformar la suya propia. Su estilo es desinhibición en estado puro. Cargada de energía, para dar caña con cada tema.

Cazzu, con temas suaves que invitan a bailar y a moverse, es conocedora de todos esos géneros tan interesantes que conforman el trap argentino. Por ello, la trapera es sin duda una de las reinas del trap latino e internacional.

Se presentó en el panorama con su primer tema Killa. Una canción que sienta unas bases muy claras, una carta de presentación como mujer empoderada, llena de espíritu underground. La artista se ha ganado el respeto de todos los artistas de trap del panorama latino, llegando a colaborar con muchos de ellos.

Sus colaboracion con Bad Bunny, Duki y Khea en LOCA y LOCA REMIX es un himno del trap mundial.

Sin duda, Cazzu, es una artista de pies a cabeza. Su presencia es poderosa y llena de arte propia. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cazzu"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

67,67,mau y ricky,164789,2213714,"For the past few years, Mauricio and Ricky Montaner had been busy writing songs for other artists like Thalía, Miguel Bosé, Diego Boneta, Yuridia, Leslie Grace, to name a few, until recently when they decided the songs they were composing would be for their EP titled Arte under the label of Sony Music.

The young duo, Mau y Ricky, sons of music icon Ricardo Montaner, have released the album's first single, ""Voy Que Quemo,"" a song they decided best represents the music that is coming out in the LP, expected to release in July. ""After writing so many songs, it just seemed natural to start recording an album,"" Ricky, 25, tells Billboard, speaking on behalf of the duo since Mau was on vocal rest. ""We have 10 songs and an 11th that is an instrumental track. 'Voy Que Quemo' seemed like the best song to release first, and we're feeling super excited and nervous.""

Mau y Ricky partnered with Latin Grammy winner Julio Reyes Copello to produce their album and credit him for allowing them to grow artistically and teach them about following their intuition. ""We've grown as producers and songwriters, thanks to him. We also learned that the intuition of an artist is so important and it's something that needs to be respected because your intuition will differentiate you from others. We learned to write for ourselves and put out songs that will represent who we are.""

And that's exactly what Mau y Ricky did. They followed their intuition after listening to their song ""Arte"" which was almost going to be pitched to Wisin, but Ricky says, ""It didn't feel right for another artist to sing this song."" Another man they have to thank for guiding them since they started composing at a very young age is their father, who has written hit singles like ""La Cima del Cielo,"" ""Déjame Llorar"" and ""Me Va a Extrañar.""

""We've written songs together, so working with him helps you grow a lot because he's a very hard critic. Every song I've written since I was 8 years old, I'd run it by him and he'd give me feedback. He actually just heard the final product of our album and he loved it, thank God. But the best thing is that he's a fan of ours and we're huge fans of him. Yeah, he's my dad, but I'm a huge Ricardo Montaner fan.""

Besides a new album, Mau y Ricky fans can expect to see them onstage soon as they go out on tour. ""We haven't toured in such a long time because we were busy writing for others then started working on this album, but the stage is our natural habitat and where we feel most comfortable."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mau+y+Ricky"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

75,75,ryan castro,283169,5213126,"Ryan Castro es una de las nuevas caras del reggaetón y, aunque en sus videos juega con la clásica estética aspiracional de los carros de alta gama y las mansiones, su proyecto nació en el barrio Pedregal, al norte de Medellín. El colegio, las calles y los vecinos del sector pueden dar fe de cómo fue el comienzo de su historia.

Luego de salir del colegio, a los 16 años, se proyectó para hacer música a nivel profesional. Inspirado por las música y las películas que vio de 50 Cent, Eminem o Daddy Yankee, Ryan salió a buscar su primer público: los usuarios del transporte urbano.

“Empecé a cantar en los buses a los 17 años porque empecé a sentir la necesidad de hacer algo y ayudar a la familia. La experiencia fue muy bacana y enriquecedora porque me hizo ganar mucha confianza”, cuenta el paisa.

En los buses hacía covers de Kafu Banton, de Baroni One Time y una que otra composición original. Su segunda gran plataforma fueron las discotecas del Valle de Aburrá, donde también cantó sus propias canciones como Morena, que es un rap romántico, y Mi Styling, un dancehall.

Luego de tocar varias puertas y ver limitadas sus oportunidades tomó la decisión de irse del país para trabajar, ahorrar dinero e invertirlo en su proyecto. Llegó a Curazao y trabajó en hoteles y restaurantes. Cada peso que ganó lo usó para costear sus producciones y los videos musicales.

En Curazao grabó dos canciones y gracias al bendito internet logró que se sonaran en su natal Medallo. Muchos creyeron que Ryan era extranjero.

Esas canciones vincularon a Ryan con la compañía discográfica del caleño Kevin Roldán. Para 2021, su nombre estará dos veces en el nuevo álbum de Kevin Roldán y, además, lanzará su disco debut que lleva por nombre El Cantante Del Guetto, un homenaje a sus raíces y su barrio. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Castro"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

76,76,valentino,72841,467037,"There are multiple musicians/bands under the same name.

1.) Valentino -- Pop-rock group from Sarajevo ""Valentino"" was founded in 1982. Group founder was the lead guitarist and songwriter Zijo Rizvanbegović - Valentino.  Zijo posted an advertisement in ""Oslobođenje"" (Sarajevo daily newspaper) looking for a lead singer and found Suad Jakirlić - Jaka. 

Valentino was a favorite of Goran Bregović, so they toured together with Bijelo Dugme. 
Goran Bregović played guitar on Valentino 1st album for a song ""Pazi na Ritam"". The Hit Song from that album was the song ""Volim te još"" (I still love you). 

Second album was titled ""Valentino II"" and released in 1985.  There were new additions to the group  Nikša Bratoš (on keyboards) and Ademir Volić - Kufi (drummer). They previously played in a band ""Bonton Baja"" which dissolved because of some government investigation concerning taxes. This caused their LP record to be pulled off the shelves minutes after being released, but a few people were lucky enough to purchase a handful. They are considered a collector's item and are very rare. 

The original line up of Valentino group consisted of: Zijo Rizvanbegović (guitar), Nikša Bratoš (keyboards), Suad Jakirlić (lead vocal), Emir Ćolaković (bass) i Ademir Volić (drums). 

Third album came out two years later (1987).  The Hit song was ""Oka tvoja dva"" (Your two eyes). 

Suad Jakirlić joined the army and after returning did not rejoin the group, or continue with his music career. In 1988 Nikša Bratoš moves to a new band [artist:Crvena Jabuka]. Dražen Ričl and Aljoša Buha, the main members of Crvena Jabuka died in 1987. 

New Valentino lead singer - Gogo Prušina helps make the fourth album. Zoran Šerbedžija joined the group as well as a new guitar player in 1988. 

Fifth album - ""Ponekad noću kad grad spava"" (Sometimes when she sleeps at night) (1989). Željko Brodarić - Jappa was the producer, Samir Šestan was on the keyboards, and a guitar player Zoran Petrović. 

As the War on the Balkans began in 1992, ""Valentino"", like many other groups, stopped working and making new music. After the War Zijo ""Valentino"" gathered the group together and got to working on another ablum titled “Moja kuća putujuća” (My Traveling House) with guests such as Hari Varešanović (Hari Mata Hari), Saša Lošić (Plavi Orkestar) and Alen Islamović. 

Six years after that album comes “Sve su se moje cure udale” (All of my girls have gotten married), which ended up sounding nothing like pop-rock sounds of Valentino but rather like ""narodna"" or country folk music. 

In 2006 there was ""Valentino 7"" under the production of City Records.



2.) Valentino is an Italo Disco project produced by Mauro Farina, Giuliano Crivellente, Franco Diaferia and Fabrizio Rizzolo, who also put his voice in the songs. Their hits are “Tonight”, “Tender Love”, “For Your Love” and “You Are The Sunshine”.


3.) Valentino is an eurodance act that released the single “Brand New Place”.


4.) Valentino Kanzyani is one of Slovenia's biggest music exports. As well as spinning techno and house on three decks across the world to huge crowds and acclaim he has released a barrage of dancefloor anthems for labels such as Primevil, Yoshi Toshi, Intec, Wet Musik, Tronic, Primate, Consumer Recreation and his and Umeks jointly run Recycled Loops and Earresistible imprints. If anyone can lay claim to putting Slovenia on the techno map then the name Valentino Kanzyani ranks high as one of its biggest propagators.

Already a big name DJ within his native Slovenia, in 1995 a club called Ambasada Gavioli opened and Valentino Kanzyani became known as the man behind one of Slovenias most famous venues. During a three and a half year period he booked and played with literally every DJ from around the globe but as the new millennium approached he left to oncentrate on his own DJing and production work. It was after going into the studio with his old friend, Umek that Valentino was to release his first record as Recycled Loops on Primevil in the summer of 1999. Thus, Valentino Kanzyanis name was soon to be heard in DJ sets all over the world and similarly his DJ gigs went supernova as he joined the jet set elite of globe-trotting record spinners.

Following the success of their initial release Umek and Valentino set up Recycled Loops as a label and have never looked back. Now having released some 12 records the duo also co-run Earresistible for their more house inspired production work whilst Valentino Kanzyanis single-handed production skills have graced labels as varied as Intec with the House Soul EP and Tronic (Burros Eslovenos) to Yoshi Toshi with the massive Flying whilst he has most recently remixed Carl Coxs new single, gaining Essential Selection status from Pete Tong.

77,77,farruko,665355,8402805,"Farruko is a reggaeton and Latin pop singer from Puerto Rico. His given name is Carlos Efren Reyes, and he was born in Bayamon, Puerto Rico in 1991. At the age of 16, he began to post his songs under his stage name to MySpace. His first single, ""Sexo Fuera del Planeta,"" gained thousands of followers, and from there he explored the potential of other social media networks. Due to his massive success on the Internet, he came to the attention of Puerto Rican radio and music industry executives, who enlisted his vocal talents for other artists.

Farruko's debut album, El Talento del Bloque, appeared when he was 18. It was released by Siente Music and distributed by Universal. Most of its 13 songs were self-penned. The set became an almost instant hit, and several singles followed from it. Some of the album's highlights included its collaborative tunes such as ""Su Hija Me Gusta"" with José Feliciano, ""Ella No Es Facil"" with Cosculluela, and ""Traime a Tu Amiga"" with Arcangel and Julio Voltio. He also issued the non-album smash ""Pa Romper la Discoteca"" with Daddy Yankee and Yomo. In 2012, he issued his sophomore offering, TMPR: The Most Powerful Rookie. Its first smash single was ""Feel the Rhythm"" (""Siente el Ritmo""), though it was one of five. As a whole, the set demonstrated that Farruko was as comfortable in electro and pop circles as he was in reggaeton; it was nominated for a Latin Grammy.

After touring throughout Latin America and the United States and establishing large fan bases in locales such as Venezuela and Colombia, he returned to recording in 2014. Farruko Presenta los Menores was released in late October of that year. A week after its release, it topped the Latin Albums chart. Among the notable collaborations are ""Salgo"" with Arcangel, Ñengo Flow, D. Ozi, and Genio y Kelmitt; ""Bebe Conmigo"" with J. Balvin; and ""Interesada"" with Luigi 21+. He won the Premios Juventud for the song ""6 AM"" with J. Balvin and Latin Grammy Awards for Best Urban Performance and Best Urban Song in 2015. In February of that year, he released ""Lejos de Aquí,"" a remix with Yandel. In June, he was Alejandra Guzman's surprise duet partner on her first urban single, ""Adios."" In July, he issued the pre-release track ""Sunset"" (featuring Shaggy and Nicky Jam), which garnered the top spot on various Latin airplay charts. In August, Farruko issued The Ones, a compilation of his charting singles and collaborations; it was a teaser for his next studio effort, Visionary, which appeared in late October. Pre-order excitement for the album propelled it to debut at number one on several Latin album charts; it remained there for several weeks after release. In 2017, he returned with his sixth studio album, Trapficante. As its title suggested, the artist put his money on the fusion of reggaeton and pop urban with the second generation of Latin trap, the latter he considered still in its infancy, making some commercial inroads but still far from its future force as the face of commercial mainstream Latin X pop -- despite its outlaw ties. He openly desired being the face of that future and drew on a host of new generation Latin trap artists as collaborators including Frank Miami, Sharo Torres, Rome, Mambo Kingz, DJ Luian, Maffio, Lil Geniuz, Bad Bunny, and Ladkani. The album was issued in September as Farruko undertook the U.S. leg of his global TrapXFicante tour. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Farruko"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

94,94,alexis y fido,231064,2180648," Known for their skillful wordplay and their comedic double entendres, reggaeton duo Alexis y Fido, affectionately known as ""Los Pitbulls,"" may be old dogs in the genre, but they have plenty of new tricks that will make audiences sit down and beg for more.

After wooing reggaeton fans with the smash single El Tiburon, featured on Luny Tunes' Mas Flow 2, the hardworking duo is now set to unleash its debut album The Pitbulls, which is promising to make the world bark to a new tune.

""I'm very cerebral; I tend to have a lot of concepts, and Alexis has to let me know whether he thinks they can executed,"" 26-year-old Joel ""Fido"" Martinez says of his contribution to the duo's chemistry. ""I'm much more reserved than Alexis. He's much more animated.""

His partner, 26-year-old Raul ""Alexis"" Ortiz, agrees. ""I'm the aggressive one, the one who gets the crowds jumping.""


Born in Cidra, Puerto Rico, and raised between the towns of Cidra and Cayey, Alexis first made his mark on the reggaeton scene in 1994, when he appeared on DJ Stefano Vol. 2 alongside two neighborhood friends.

Although he knew music was his calling, he found himself secluded from the genre's pioneers by virtue of living outside of the metropolitan area, the hub of activity at that time. Frustrated by the hardships of gaining recognition, he decided to retire and spent almost five years away from the studio.

Similarly, Cayey native Fido started pursuing his musical ambitions at an early age.

""I've been singing since the music was called 'underground,' before it was even named reggaeton,"" he says. ""I started when I was 11 years old. Around the time when Vico C released La Recta Final, I was doing talent shows and performing wherever I could.""

But like Alexis, Fido was discouraged by the competitive nature of the developing movement and decided to put his career on pause for a few years. That is, until, he saw the streets' growing interest in the musical form.

""I started getting back into it when people started selling their own cassette tapes in the streets,"" he recalls. ""We'd record our own tapes at home, wrap them in some plastic and sell them on the street.""

In 1995, Fido scored an appearance on a DJ Stefano production, followed by a single on DJ Nelson's Little Boys from the Underground 3.

But despite the inroads he'd made, Fido felt overwhelmed by the difficulties before him. He once again decided to withdraw from the scene but, this time, he envisioned a different life for himself, enlisting in the Army and executing a four-year stint.
NBC on iTunes

""I was frustrated again - I felt like we weren't being given the opportunities that we deserved because we weren't from the metropolitan area,"" Fido says. ""Back then, they used to say that Carolina was the reggaeton Mecca.""

While Fido was in the military, his good friend Yandel (of the duo Wisin y Yandel) linked up with Wisin during an MC competition in Salinas, Puerto Rico. Their newly established partnership proved fruitful, and they quickly began to raise eyebrows among the genre's frontrunners.
""I've known Yandel since I was in sixth grade,"" Fido says. ""I was the one who told Yandel he needed to start performing. When I came back from the Army and he had teamed up with Wisin, they decided to help me.""

Meanwhile, Alexis made his reentry into the genre in the year 2000, appearing in La Mision III with the songs Sigan Perreando and Otra Noche Mas, and in the production Grayskull with the party anthem Manos Arriba. He then appeared in Wisin y Yandel's De Otra Manera and on both Wisin and Yandel's subsequent solo albums.

""I was friends with Wisin,"" Alexis says. ""We used to sing around the neighborhood together, and Fido was always with Yande, so we were all part of the same crew. After Wisin y Yandel got together, Fido and I spent even more time with each other.""

Still, the two continued to pursue their own separate paths. It wasn't until the compilation album Desafio that Alexis y Fido tested out their potential as a duo.

""There were 23 tracks recorded already so there was only room for one more track in the production,"" Alexis says. ""One of us was going to be omitted so the producers suggested that we perform together.""

Their synergy was palpable and so the two continued to perform together, displaying their skills on songs like Gata Racing off of Blin Blin Vol. 1 and El Palo on El Band 2 Korrupto.

""El Palo was a real turning point in our careers,"" Alexis says of the song that thrust them into the limelight in 2003. ""That was the song that earned us our respect."" Fido agrees wholeheartedly, ""El Palo would have been as big as Gasolina, but the album wasn't funded appropriately so it wasn't really promoted overseas, but in Puerto Rico it was the No. 1 song for months.""

After El Palo's success, the duo was in heavy demand. They recorded such hits as Tocale Bocina on Noriega's Contra La Corriente, El Rolo on La Mision IV and Gata Michu Michu on the top-selling Hector El Bambino Presenta Los Anormales.

They quickly became known as ""Los Pitbulls"" because of Alexis' tendency to bark on his records. He introduced the trademark sound early on in his career at Yandel's prompting.

""One time, I went out with my son and Yandel and his son,"" Alexis says. ""When we were on our way home, both kids started getting cranky, and I started making barking noises to make them laugh. Yandel was like, 'How do you do that? You have to put that in your records!' After that, I started using the slogan 'Alexis el Pitbull ladrando' (Alexis the Pitbull barking). ""

He says that although the ""Pitbull"" moniker was initially his, Fido more than deserves to share the title. ""I'm the one who barks, but Fido is the one who bites,"" he jokes.

After years of performing together and amassing a huge fan in Puerto Rico, the duo unleashed their picaresque song El Tiburon on Luny Tunes' Latin Grammy-nominated album Mas Flow 2, which was released earlier this year. The song established them as international superstars.

""People really appreciate our originality,"" Alexis says. ""We have fun concepts and we use la lot of adult humor. The sexual aspect of our lyrics is only evident to adults, and we make sure that we never say anything that could be offensive towards women.""

For his part, Fido has earned a name for himself as an accomplished beatmaker. He was responsible for the unique rhythmic patterns Wisin y Yandel's En La Disco Bailoteo and Esta Noche Hay Pelea, and he produced the singles Dale Caliente, El Muro and No Me Dejes Solo on Daddy Yankee's multi-platinum-selling Barrio Fino album.

""I made those songs from beginning to end,"" Fido says. ""Urba y Monserrate did the mixing on those tracks, but I came up with the rhythms.""

His production genius is evident in Los Pitbulls through such singles as Eso Ehhh, El Cumbiaton and Tu No Sabes, which he concocted with the help of producer Nesty.

""Sonically, this album has a bit of everything,"" Alexis says. ""El Cumbiaton mixes cumbia with mariachi sounds, Perro Caliente uses beatboxing sounds, Tributo Borincano has a dancehall flavor and Tu no Sabes is a softer ballad-style song.""

The much-anticipated effort features appearances by the likes of Terror Squad's Tony Sunshine, Hector ""el Father,"" Zion y Lennox, Trebol Clan and Baby Ranks and production by heavyweights like Noriega, Nesty, Echo, and Luny Tunes.

With such a remarkable pedigree and an insatiable hunger, it's no mystery why Alexis y Fido are known as reggaeton's only pitbulls. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Alexis+y+Fido"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In December of the same year he released his second single ""Esperándote"", which accumulates more than 750 million views on YouTube. In 2018, he released various singles such as: ""Culpables"", ""Sola"", ""Una Vez Más"" with Noriel and ""Vaina Loca"" with Ozuna, the latter became his first Billboard Hot 100-charting hit, peaking at number 94 and staying on the chart for two weeks; while  his song ""Sola"" became his first number one song on the Billboard Latin Airplay chart in March 2019.

From a very young age, Manuel and his brother, Julián, were surrounded by music, playing any instrument that was passed through in the search of perfecting art. Thus, while Julian chose the guitar, Manuel focused on singing and began taking vocal technique classes in Montería with a Cuban teacher. For him, compositions with universal lyrics that seek to reach the soul, are the formula of success and longs for its fans to continue with the support they have shown so far.

Manuel Turizo will grow under the spotlight, between concerts and fans, but he is confident that the humility and goal he has set to be one of the greatest urban artists in Latin America, will make him stay on a fixed course.

125,125,fanny lu,87252,833821,"Actress and musician Fanny Lú was born in Cali, Colombia, where she attended the Bolivar High School before moving to France to finish her primary education. Upon returning to Latin America, she studied at the University of the Andes, graduating with a degree in industrial engineering. While still in college, Lú maintained a television career, beginning in 1994 as a presenter on the popular show Locomotora. Her experience on the show gave her countless opportunities to work around musicians and even make forays into production work, learning what it meant to be on the other side of the camera. As her contact with professional musicians such as Luis Manuel Díaz, Gil Magno, and Cesar Franco continued, so did her desire to pursue her own musical expression. Putting years of networking to good use, Lú struck a deal with Universal Latino, which released her debut album, Lágrimas Cálidas, in 2006. The record's single, ""No Te Pido Flores,"" became the theme song for a popular telenovela, a sure path to record industry success. Lágrimas Cálidas achieved gold status in no time, landing singles on a variety of Billboard's Latin charts. A series of U.S. appearances later and Lú began to catch the eye of North American audiences. Already well known throughout Latin America, Lú joined the rising number of Spanish-speaking pop icons who made big waves in English-language markets (Shakira, Ricky Martin, Enrique Iglesias). ~ Evan C.
