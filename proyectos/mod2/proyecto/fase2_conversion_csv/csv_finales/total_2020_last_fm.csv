1,1,glass animals,2166336,105915363,"Glass Animals is an English electronic/indie rock band formed in Oxford in 2010. The band's line-up consists of Dave Bayley (vocals, guitar, keyboards, drums, songwriting), Drew MacFarlane (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Edmund Irwin-Singer (bass, keyboards, backing vocals), and Joe Seaward (drums).

All four members of the band met at St Edward's School in Oxford. Dave Bayley attended St Edward's on a music scholarship and was introduced to Drew MacFarlane, who would become the band's guitarist and backing vocalist; the two bonded over the fact that they were both Britons who had spent their childhoods in the U.S. MacFarlane then introduced Bayley to Edmund Irwin-Singer, the band's bassist, and Joe Seaward, its drummer. They began playing together as a group in 2010.

On 28 May 2012, the band released their debut EP Leaflings, which included the single ""Cocoa Hooves"". The EP was released on independent label Kaya Kaya Records, a subsidiary and imprint of XL Recordings (part of the Beggars Group of labels).

In 2014, the band made their first tour of the U.S. and performed at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. They released three more singles: ""Gooey"", ""Pools"", and ""Hazey"", along with a collaboration with Argentine singer-songwriter and producer Tei Shi. All five singles were included on the band's debut album, Zaba, which was released on 6 June 2014. The band performed the single ""Gooey"" on Late Night with Seth Meyers on 9 October 2014 and again on Late Show with David Letterman on 24 February 2015, and toured extensively after Zaba, visiting both hemispheres and playing over 130 shows in 2015 alone. Their October 2015 US tour included two sold-out shows at The Wiltern in LA and sold-out shows across America including T5 in NYC, The Riverside in Milwaukee, and the Midland Theatre in Kansas City. ""Gooey"" went on to be certified platinum in the U.S., cementing the band’s foothold in the alternative music scene.

Their second album, How to Be a Human Being (2016), won two MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self Producing Artist of the Year and was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize. The concept behind the album, in which each song tells a story inspired by fictional characters, allowed the band to explore various musical styles and themes, contributing to its widespread acclaim.

The band's third album, Dreamland (2020), marked a more introspective turn, as Bayley delved into personal themes, touching on nostalgia and memory. Dreamland reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and number seven on the US Billboard 200, driven in part by the massive success of “Heat Waves.” The song, which became a global hit through TikTok, eventually topped charts worldwide, including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and achieved over two billion Spotify streams by 2022. The album was promoted with singles like “Tokyo Drifting” featuring rapper Denzel Curry and “Your Love (Déjà Vu)”.

Glass Animals’ achievements were recognized with two Brit Award nominations in 2022 and a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist, marking their influence in both the indie and mainstream music scenes. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Glass+Animals"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Sidecars son herederos de la saga que arrancó con Tequila y su genuina fijación “stoniana”, siguió con Ronaldos y su facilidad para obtener himnos de descarada picardía juvenil, y llega hasta nuestros días con referentes como Fito y Fitipaldis o Pereza, (con estos últimos les unen lazos que van más allá de lo anecdótico).

Dos temas sirven de muestra como carta de presentación de la banda, dos rockandrolles para todos los públicos, resueltos, atrevidos, efervescentes y magníficamente interpretados: “Muy bien” donde le dan la vuelta al tópico chico-busca-chica y lo cambían por un sorpresivo chico-abandona-chica y “Un tipo elegante”, declaración de unos tipos que se reconocen poco elegantes, nada interesantes y en los que , por supuesto, no se puede confiar ... Sidecars ¿No son un encanto?

The trio's first single 'A Calf Born In Winter' was released in May 2014 by Late Night Tales offshoot Night Time Stories, and saw support from DJs Zane Lowe, Cerys Matthews, Tom Ravenscroft, Gideon Coe and magazines as musically diverse as Test Pressing, For Folks Sake, i-D, The 405 and Ransom Note. 'The Infamous Bill' is an expanded offering of Khruangbin's exotic, individual sound. The EP's four tracks were recorded at their spritual home, a remote barn deep in the Texas countryside where Khruangbin's first rehearsals took place. Taking influence from 1960's Thai funk - Khruangbin literally translates to ""Engine Fly"" in Thai - the EP is steeped in the bass heavy, psychedelic sound of their inspiration, Tarantino soundtracks and surf-rock cool.

Mark and DJ's roots are in R&B, hip hop and gospel having played within the same gospel band for years. Both professional musicians, Mark began teaching Laura how to play bass in the summer of 2009. As such, Laura quickly developed a huge passion for the instrument and the aesthetic it brought to music she loved. Having worked studiously on developing her skills, both Mark and Laura were invited to tour with Ninja Tune's YPPAH supporting Bonobo across his 2010 American tour. The tour galvanised the two of them to start making music together more seriously, sowing the first seeds of Khruangbin, with DJ the natural go to for drums. Having kept in touch, Bonobo included Khruangbin's 'A Calf Born In Winter' on his 2013 'Late Night Tales' compilation. In addition to increasing the Stateside following the band has built, the release has helped Khruangbin in topping both the US & UK 'Last FM' fastest growing artists whilst 'A Calf Born In Winter' continues to be one of the most popular single downloads from the compilation. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Khruangbin"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

28,28,ellie goulding,3340724,125387323,"Ellie Goulding (born Elena Jane Goulding, 30 December 1986 in Hereford, England) is an English singer-songwriter. Having caught the public's attention in 2010 with her singles ""Starry Eyed"" and ""Guns and Horses,"" British vocalist Ellie Goulding quickly rose to the top of the charts with her infectious electronic pop sound. Although she started out writing songs in a folk-inflected style, she eventually grew into a more electronic-influenced artist, touching upon dance music and ambient synth pop. With her unique soprano warble and knack for writing catchy yet emotionally earnest songs, Goulding, much like her predecessors Kate Bush and Imogen Heap, stands at the forefront of contemporary mainstream music and arty, independent-minded pop.

Born in Hereford, England, she later moved to the country's east coast to study drama at the University of Kent. Goulding had developed a love for folk music as a teenager, and her time at university also exposed her to electronica. After two years, she took a break from her studies and moved to West London, where she pursued a career as an alternative singer/songwriter and befriended producers like Starsmith and Frankmusik, who gave her songs an electro-pop twist. In 2009, Goulding began building an audience via the Internet, where early tracks like ""Starry Eyed"" and a cover of Sam Sparro's ""Black & Gold"" were posted on tastemaking MP3 blogs such as Discodust. Goulding soon graduated from the blogosphere to print media, gaining praise from mainstream publications like The Guardian and fielding offers from record labels. She ultimately signed a major-label deal with Polydor Records and began making preparations to release her debut album. In the meantime, she penned songs for Diana Vickers, Gabriella Climi, and others.

During the final weeks of 2009, Goulding topped the BBC's Sound of 2010, a poll conducted by British music critics and industry insiders to identify new talent. Building on that momentum, she released Lights -- a sparkling debut album that splashed Goulding's vocal flutter across a landscape of acoustic and synthesized instruments -- in March 2010. Lights topped the U.K. charts during its first week and spun off ""Starry Eyed"" as a Top Five single (it also charted well in Ireland and New Zealand). Later that year, the album was re-released as Bright Lights, featuring seven new recordings (including a cover of Elton John's ""Your Song,"" which peaked at number two).

In 2012, Goulding returned with her sophomore album, Halcyon, which showcased an even more sonically adventurous, electro-pop-infused sound. In 2013, a deluxe reissue featuring ten extra songs was released; entitled Halcyon Days, it acted as a supplement to the original release. Two of its new songs, ""Burn"" and ""How Long Will I Love You,"" were among her biggest hits. The following year, she was featured on Calvin Harris' Top Ten U.K. hit ""Outside,"" participated in Band Aid 30's update of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?,"" and entered the U.K. Top Ten once more with ""Beating Heart,"" a song released on the soundtrack for Divergent. Another soundtrack single, ""Love Me Like You Do,"" added to the success of Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015.

That same year, Goulding released her third studio album, Delirium, which featured collaborations with Max Martin, Greg Kurstin, and others. The pop-leaning Delirium included the single ""On My Mind"" and peaked at number three on the U.S. and U.K. charts. Goulding returned in 2017 on ""First Time,"" a collaboration with electronic producer Kygo.

In 2018, Goulding joined Tap Management after almost a decade with First Access Management.[107] She appeared on a collaboration with Sean Paul on his Mad Love the Prequel EP titled ""Bad Love"", released on 29 June 2018.[108]

On 12 April 2019, Goulding released the single ""Sixteen"".[113] Goulding said of the single, ""...That age was such a pivotal year for me in many ways and this song is so close to my heart. It takes me back to the reckless days of being a teenager and I hope it reminds us all about the innocence of youth.""[114]

Goulding released ""Hate Me"" with American rapper Juice Wrld on 26 June 2019.[115][116] It was premiered by Zane Lowe as his 'World Record' on Beats 1.[117] In July, Goulding stated that her next material to be released would be the songs ""Woman I Am"" and ""Start"".[118] In November, she released her rendition of Joni Mitchell's Christmas song ""River"", which topped the UK Singles Chart, becoming her third UK number one single and the last UK number one song of the 2010s.[119]

On 13 March 2020, Goulding released the new single ""Worry About Me"" which was created in-collaboration with Blackbear.[120] In a radio interview with Heart the same month, she revealed that the album ""kind of comes in two parts"", adding that ""the first side is something written entirely by me which was fun and I wrote most of it in New York when I was living there a few years back. I play the guitar and I play the bass and piano and then I'm singing a lot of vocals. It's very classically influenced because I love classical music. There's a lot going on, it's a big soundscape and one big film. The second half is my kind of alter ego songs.""[121] On 21 May she released single ""Power"" and on 30 June single ""Slow Grenade"" with Lauv.

Goulding released her fourth studio album, Brightest Blue, on 17 July 2020. Originally scheduled for 5 June 2020, the album's release was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album debuted at the top of the UK Album Chart, becoming Goulding's third album to do so,[122] as well as at No. 2 in Scotland.[123] It reached the top 10 in Ireland[124] as well as the top 40 in over ten countries including Australia, Germany and the United States.

Goulding announced on an Instagram Q&A that she would be releasing new music which was not part of the Brightest Blue era at the end of January 2021.[125] On 21 January, she released a collaboration with electronic duo Silk City, titled ""New Love"".[126] On 30 September, Goulding performed ""Anything Could Happen"" as part of the opening ceremony for Expo 2020, held in Dubai.[127]

On 19 June 2022, Goulding performed at Rock in Rio in Lisbon, Portugal. After the concert, she announced that she would be releasing new music in July. The following day, she blacked out all her social media profiles.[128] Back in July 2021, during an interview with Joe Wicks, she described the forthcoming album as ""a dance record. It's electronic pop, a dance thing from outer space"".[129] On 4 July 2022, she announced the release of ""Easy Lover"" featuring Big Sean, which was released on 15 July.[130] The single did not enter the UK Singles Top 100, but peaked at number 31 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart Top 100.[131] It was followed by ""All by Myself"", a collaboration between Goulding and producers Alok and Sigala, on 7 October.[132] Goulding released the single ""Let It Die"" along with its video on 19 October and announced the same day that her fifth studio album Higher Than Heaven would be released on 3 February 2023.[133][134]

The band's primary member is vocalist, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer Anthony Gonzalez. The band was initially formed as a duo also with Nicolas Fromageau; it has released eight albums and three soundtracks, including the Grammy Award-nominated Hurry Up, We're Dreaming.

Gonzalez and Fromageau parted ways shortly after touring their second album Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts. Gonzalez records primarily on his own, with other artists as guest musicians. The band is signed to Mute Records and found international success in 2011 with the single ""Midnight City"". Their most recent album Fantasy was released on 17 March 2023.

Anthony Gerard Gonzalez (born March 13, 1980) grew up in Antibes, France together with his brother Yann. His family had a great interest in football and Gonzalez had trials with AS Cannes, while his maternal grandfather is the French international Laurent Robuschi. At the age of 14 he got injured and turned to music instead after his parents bought him a guitar. Gonzalez developed his interest in music and American culture while at secondary school. Together with Fromageau he formed a post-rock outfit called My Violent Wish. 

At the age of 17, Gonzalez bought a synth to record a demo, which he sent to a number of French labels. When the Paris-based Gooom Records appeared interested, he recruited Fromageau to ""help me because I didn't feel like I had the shoulders to carry the project on my own"". The band is named after the galaxy of the same name.

The band's musical aesthetic is characterized by extensive use of reverb effects and lyrics spoken softly over loud instruments. Gonzalez has been inspired by aspects of the American Dream and his songs have been outlined as themed around ""adult-scripted teen dreams"". Inspiration for the 1980s style found in much of Gonzalez’s music includes bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Pink Floyd, and Tangerine Dream. Between various electronic music properties and album artwork, M83’s style includes a mix of both contemporary pop and 1980s dream pop. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/M83"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The group (which was technically a solo project with a backing band) released Just Another Ordinary Day (2003) independently.

In 2001 Watson released his first own solo debut, Waterproof9 and in 2006 his second, Close to Paradise. Early in 2007, Watson was nominated for a Juno Canada's music award in the New Artist of the Year category.

His band's song ""The Great Escape"" was featured on a third-season episode of Grey's Anatomy.

34,34,la maravillosa orquesta del alcohol,41308,1627026,"According to the legend, this peculiar band was created in Grafton Street, one of the main streets in Dublin, where musicians from all over the world meet to make a living by playing alive. Joselito Maravilla (accordion) and Maravilloso David (main vocals, guitar) met over there.

After some months playing on the streets, they decided to come back to Spain and start up a band mixing traditional music (Irish, American and Slavic), rock&roll structures and the most classic blues. To accomplish such an achivement, they recruited the two most particular musicians they found: inimitable Juan Mariscal (bass) and matchless Adán R&R Maravilla (guitar).

Once the band is setup, La Maravillosa Orquesta shut themselves away in their garage to carry out frenzied rehearsal sessions. Finally, they got a handful of songs. To back them up alive, la M.O.D.A. turns to well-known saxophonist Álvar de Maravilla, fiddler Bea Ruiz and drummer Maraviglioso Caleb.

At age 17, Kahan began working with school friend music producers (Cwenga Matanzima). This attracted the attention of his current manager Drew Simmons of Foundations Artist Management. His music also caught the attention of songwriters such as Dan Wilson known for his work with Adele, Scott Harris, Carrie Underwood, among others. Kahan deferred his admission to Tulane University to pursue his developing music career. Kahan has said that two career goals he wished for were to be verified on Instagram and to have a Wikipedia page.

Kahan cites some of his inspirations as Paul Simon, Cat Stevens, Counting Crows, Hozier, and Mumford and Sons.

In 2016, Kahan signed to Republic Records and he began working with producer Joel Little, known for his work with Lorde and Khalid, with whom he recorded six songs. Kahan released his first single ""Young Blood"" in January 2017 and gained over 9 million streams.

The album was recorded over one week at Kahan's friend Phin Choukas' home studio in Vermont exactly one week after the singer left New York City in March to avoid COVID-19. ""Cape Elizabeth"" was then released on May 1, 2020.

On June 17, 2021 Kahan announced his second full-length album titled ""I Was/I Am"". Five days later he announced the ""I Was/I Am"" tour. On September 17, 2021, the album was released. Throughout the summer leading up to the release of the album Kahan released “Part of Me”, “Godlight”, and “Animal” as singles ahead of the album drop. “Part of Me” was the only one of the three singles to be dropped before the album announcement.

Kahan opened for Ben Folds and Anderson East in the United States in February 2017 and then went on to open for Milky Chance in March 2017. Later opening on an East Coast tour with The Strumbellas that began on October 12, 2017, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and concluded on November 14, 2017, in Buffalo, New York. He performed at Billboard's Industry Night on November 16, 2017, at the Ludlow House in New York City, showcasing his pop-folk song ""Fine"".

Over the following two years, the song became a fan favorite, further growing in popularity on social media app TikTok. Kahan followed it up with the release of ""Northern Attitude"" on September 16.

On October 14, 2022, Kahan released his album Stick Season. According to early reviews of the album from AP News, ""There’s irony there because these feel like songs both longtime listeners and newer fans will want to belt back to Kahan — not because they’re produced for stadiums or arenas, but because they’re full of nostalgic melodies that will resonate far beyond New England."" Kahan wrote this album during the pandemic which he spent back home in Vermont. Stick Season leans more into the folk genre than the rest of his older music which were more pop sounding. Kahan says that in his album, Stick Season, he wanted to pay homage to the folk singers that he grew up listening to. He adds that his greatest goal as a songwriter is to write music that other people can relate to and to be able to throw that lifeline to someone.

On March 17, 2023, Kahan was featured on Joy Oladokun's single ""We're All Gonna Die"", which was also released as part of her April 2023 album, Proof of Life.

On June 9, 2023, Kahan released a deluxe version of Stick Season titled, Stick Season (We'll All Be Here Forever), which includes seven previously unreleased tracks. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Noah+Kahan"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lleshaj, an Albanian originally from Kosovo, whose family fled to Sweden while she was a child to escape war and conflict in the region, was living in Stockholm when she met Randall, from Minneapolis, on SoundCloud in 2012. Lleshaj began commenting on the tracks Randall had posted and the two discovered they appreciated each other's music. After meeting in person in Minneapolis, they began working together in Sweden as Flora Cash. The duo has said that they've never revealed the origin or meaning of their band name to anyone.

In 2012, the pair met on SoundCloud and struck up a musical connection, leading Shpresa Lleshaj to travel from Stockholm to Minneapolis to meet Cole Randall in person. They returned to Sweden together and immediately began work as Flora Cash.

After independently releasing a handful of songs and two EPs, the pair signed with Swedish label Icons Creating Evil Art, after which they released, Can Summer Love Last Forever?, in March 2016. The seven-song mini-LP earned them nominations for two GAFFA awards, as Swedish Artist of the Year and Swedish Newcomer of the Year.

Flora Cash broke into the mainstream with their song “You’re Somebody Else”; a track from their debut full-length album, Nothing Lasts Forever (And It’s Fine), which Steve Baltin, writing for Forbes Magazine called “arguably the most intriguing song on radio this past year.”. The song reached #1 on Alternative Radio and achieved RIAA Platinum Certification in the United States.

The duo performed several times on American television after making their debut on The Late Late Show with James Corden and toured with Sir Sly, Joywave, lovelytheband, Judah & the Lion and AJR throughout 2018 and 2019.

72,72,fink,754098,16078219,"There are, at least, two artists known as Fink: 1) A Brighton-based acoustic folk / blues / electronic artist. 2) A Hamburg, Germany alt-country band, founded mid-90s & disbanded in 2007.

(1)Fink, Brighton-based acoustic folk / blues / electronic artist

A recording / performance name of Brighton, UK's Fin Greenall - a Bristol-born understated singer-songwriter. He is an uncompromising artist - in acoustic folk / blues / dub - with an astounding stage presence, signed to Ninja Tune Records. With live accompaniment by Guy Whittaker (bass) & Tim Thornton (drums), they have played over 300 shows, in the last three years (inc' supporting Zero 7 & Massive Attack). In addition to his performance history, Fink has written with many (inc' John Legend & Amy Winehouse), plus remixed Elbow, Nina Simone, 坂本龍一 & Robert Belfour. Prior to all of this, Greenall - who grew up in the same city as Roni Size, Portishead & Massive Attack - was a Ninja Tune DJ, spinning trip-hop & breakbeat internationally. 

Fink’s 2006 debut Biscuits For Breakfast (recorded entirely in his loft in Brighton) saw him reincarnated to become Ninja Tune’s first singer-songwriter. Such was the impact of this collection of songs on the underground British musical landscape, iDJ Magazine stated: ""If 'Blue Lines' was about Generation X's experience of house parties, hip-hop and smoking drugs then this astonishing album is its millennial equivalent."" 

2007 saw the release of Distance And Time, another critically acclaimed record that saw Fink’s fan base spread around the world. As an incredibly accomplished and versatile vocalist and guitarist he has since performed as a special guest in front of thousands at London's Royal Albert Hall as part of BBC Proms, New York's legendary Carnegie Hall (where he performed a cover of REM’s ‘The Apologist’ in front of the song’s creators), and even Milan's 80,000 capacity San Siro Stadium. It was also Distance And Time that caught the attention of John Legend, with whom Greenall co-wrote ‘Green Light’ featuring Andre 3000 and ‘Set Me Free’ from Legend’s Evolver LP. Legend, in return, makes a guest appearance on piano, and co-wrote two tracks with Greenall on Sort Of A Revolution. 

There are very few independent artists who have quietly accomplished such an amazing array of achievements, and judging by this new and impeccable record, it doesn't seem that Fink - many a music fan's best kept secret - will be a secret for too much longer.

2) On their previous tour, Disclosure arrived in Newport News, VA, 4 1/2 hours from home to learn that their show had been cancelled. Here, most bands would have called it a day, but instead they frantically called friends to search for shows via MySpace. They ended up playing for free and headlining a show in Richmond, VA. This is just one of many stories that showcase Disclosure’s dedication.

In the past 3 years they have released 3 albums, have been part of an East Coast distributed compilation, performed in 7 states, went on 2 self-booked tours, and played over 50 shows. They have an upcoming full East Coast tour scheduled for July/August 2010 and they have no plans of slowing down.

Extremely limited run of 25 copies and available only at Crunch Pod and was only available at live C/A/T performances in Summer 2005.
CD-R version is out of print. This album was recently re-issued as a digital download direct from Crunch Pod.

Now signed with New Vision Records and having recently released their latest EP at the o2 academy2 Islington, Disclosure have never sounded so focussed and relevant and this year will be hitting venues around the UK.

Beginning his career as a rapper and producer, Terrace Martin has lent his skills to artists such as Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, Lalah Hathaway, Raphael Saadiq, Charlie Wilson, Stevie Wonder, and the legendary Emotions, just to name a few. Martins big break came when he produced a Power 106 radio drop with Snoop Dogg. Shattering the acknowledged rules of hip-hop production, he samples everything from funk to jazz to classical to create fresh and original tracks. His wildly imaginative productions have made him one of the most sought after upcoming producers on the streets of Los Angeles. Born to father, a jazz drummer and mother, a singer, Martin's birthright was music. Growing up listening to everyone from Coltrane to Parliament, he began playing the piano at the age of six. Producing his first tracks on his Casio CZ101 Keyboard and an Sp1200, Martin decided to broaden his musicality and picked up the saxophone. At Locke High, under the auspices of Reggie Andrews, Martin became first chair of the All-State jazz band. As a child prodigy, Martin gained the interest of talk show host Jay Leno, who presented him with a scholarship and later purchased his first professional horn. Not only did Hollywood elite recognize Martin but also world-renowned jazz musician, Billy Higgins, who later made Martin a member of his World Stage All-Stars. Fresh out of high school, Martin attended Cal-Arts but decided school wasnt for him and began touring with Puff Daddy and gospels own Gods Property. From jazz to hip-hop, Martins role models include Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Jackie McLean, John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, Sonny Stitt, Grover Washington, Jr., Dr. Dre, Dj Quik, Battlecat, Premier, Pete Rock, and 1580 K-Day.

A string of singles and an EP for the Nettwerk label paved the way for his 2019 full-length debut, Ode to a Friend.

After several years playing in bands around the Atlanta area, Cramer decided to forge ahead as a solo act, adopting the Old Sea Brigade name in 2015. Self-released in 2016, his eponymous debut EP earned him enough buzz to land key support slots for Hiss Golden Messenger, Julien Baker, and Benjamin Francis Leftwich during his first U.S. tour. Later that year, he inked a deal with Nettwerk and began work on a follow-up release. Cramer's first single for Nettwerk, the rousing ""All the Same,"" dropped in September 2016 and was later included on 2017's Wash Me Away, the first of three EPs he would issue that year. The song ""Tidal Wave,"" from his next EP, Cover My Own, notched significant play on streaming networks. Cramer closed out a banner year with the Christmas EP Songs for the Holidays.

87,87,tom misch,679948,17773798,"“Apparently, I have a sound , and people can hear it,” Tom Misch claims modestly. For someone with a cohesive and sprawling body of mellow beats behind him, he seems mildly bewildered that this is the case. “I try so many genres that it’s hard sometimes to pinpoint. I guess my sound is uplifting, soulful, funky — and happy more than it is sad.” It’s a perfect description of his debut album, due in 2018, which brings together low-slung hip-hop beats, glittering disco, and noodling jazz instrumentation in a way only Misch can.

If Misch seems surprised, it’s because his fanbase has developed naturally. He never set out with any grand plan when he began making beats, and uploading roughly three tracks a week to Soundcloud at 16. “ I prefer a more organic approach to making music, but also to building a fanbase,” he reflects. “I don’t want a big push on my music as I don’t want to be as big as possible.” And yet, he’s rapidly become one of the U.K.’s most exciting emerging new artists, gaining 1.1 million monthly listeners on Spotify and playing a sold-out tour of the U.K., U.S. and Europe in 2016. Collaborating with a clutch of fellow trailblazers like Novelist, Loyle Carner, and Zak Abel, he’s accumulated a total of 75 million streams across all platforms to date — and it all started in his bedroom.

Misch’s earliest introduction to music came via his artistic family, including his psychiatrist father, a passionate violinist, who would take him to concerts and the opera as a child. He sang in a choir at school, and picked up the violin himself at the age of four. When one of his older sisters took up guitar and later abandoned it, nine-year-old Misch inherited the instrument, and taught himself to play Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Nirvana songs. Today, he also plays bass, banjo, and a smattering of keys.

It was one of his sister’s boyfriends who introduced him to the music of J Dilla at 15, and from then on, Misch was hooked. He took up Music Technology at school the following year, and began learning how to create his own “really chilled out, boom-bap kind of ‘90s hip-hop” on Logic Pro. “When I wasn’t at school, I’d be making beats,” he says. “It was just what I did.” As he began sharing his tunes on Soundcloud, he found the response was overwhelming. “You put songs out and you build a fanbase — it’s kind of addictive.”

A collaboration with his sister Laura, on the jazz-inflected “Follow,” was a major turning point for both siblings after it was uploaded to influencer YouTube channel Majestic Casual. The track features Laura on sax and Tom on beats and vocals, intertwined to mesmeric effect. “That was the point where I was like, okay, maybe I could do this as a career,” Misch reflects. “Suddenly it had 100,000 plays.” Shortly afterward, Soulection co-founder Joe Kay commented on one of Misch’s productions on Soundcloud, asking the teenage prodigy to guest on his radio show.

Soon afterward, in 2014, Misch contributed to Soulection’s White Label series, weaving together obscure jazz samples, guitar, and vocals to create the perfect summer listen (including the dreamy fan favourite “The Journey”). His Beat Tape series collected the best of his hip-hop instrumentals, the 5 Day Mischon project featured collaborations with grime MC Novelist and singer-songwriter Zak Abel, and his 2016 Reverie EP brought the official release of Misch’s most sophisticated songs to date. As well as soulful singers Carmody and Jordan Rakei, he struck up a collaborative relationship with fellow south Londoner Loyle Carner, whose mellow bars flow over Misch’s productions like a breeze on a hot day. Both artists form part of the much-hyped scene of singer-songwriters emerging from south east London, including King Krule and Cosmo Pyke. Each has a DIY mindset and a brooding, poetic approach to lyricism that weaves them loosely together. “There’s definitely a certain sound,” reflects Misch. “Everyone’s music in south London is really chilled. It reflects the vibe of this part of London — it’s laid back.”

Misch has lived in south London all his life, and he loves it so much that his new single, “South of the River,” is dedicated to it. “I much prefer the general vibe of south London,” he says. “I love this area, Peckham, Dulwich, Forest Hill. Singing that line — You should come south of the river — it just felt really good.” With its string arrangements mirroring disco synth stabs and a funky bassline, it’s an irresistible bop that nods clearly to Misch’s danceable new direction.

One of the biggest influences on Misch’s sound has long been jazz. With a degree in jazz guitar, Misch is an avid listener of Robert Glasper, Roy Hargrove, Cory Henry, and jazz-influenced songwriters like D’Angelo and Erykah Badu. “It’s kind of a warm feeling, when you hear a certain chord progression,” he explains.

In the making of his debut album, he’s also been drawing on inspiration from disco, house, and techno, discovered through the portal of producers like Kaytranada and Motor City Drum Ensemble. The euphoric feel of 1970s and ‘80s disco (think Earth Wind and Fire or Gwen McCrae), and the thump of nightclubs like Fabric or Corsica, inspired him to bring more movement into his songs. “I want people to dance at my live shows, I want to bring more energy,” he says. “When you’re in a club and you can feel the bass...I want people to have that experience.”

Misch’s sound is true to its roots — he still makes his tracks in the same bedroom studio in his parents’ house, and his mum produces his artwork. (“ Her work is very DIY, just like my music, and feels homespun,” he explains.) But he’s never afraid to explore new territory. “I think it’s really important to make music that hasn’t been made before,” he says. “I’m trying to work out what my sound is, and pursuing that.” Fans might think they know his style, but Misch is a restless experimentalist, keen to spend endless hours honing his craft. One of his favorite new songs is a “Brazilian-sounding” jam that reflects how deeply he feels about his work. As he puts it: “It’s about how you can’t take away my love for music. I’ll always have that.” <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Misch"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

88,88,dominic fike,1848366,100850066,"Dominic David Fike (Born December 30, 1995) is an American Singer and Alternative hip-hop artist from Naples, Florida. Fike first received recognition after releasing several popular songs on the website SoundCloud. Following the release of his debut EP, Don't Forget About Me, Demos, he signed to Columbia Records. Fike's song ""3 Nights"" reached the top ten in multiple countries. He later collaborated with the band BROCKHAMPTON and singer Halsey. In June 2020, Fike released the single ""Chicken Tenders"". In July of the same year, he released the single ""Politics & Violence"". Fike's debut album, What Could Possibly Go Wrong, was released the same month. The album charted in the top 50 in multiple countries, including the United States and Australia.

In September 2020, Fike became a headliner for a concert series in the video game Roblox. A few months later, NME included Fike on their list of essential new artists for 2020. He recorded a cover of Paul McCartney's song ""The Kiss of Venus"" for the album McCartney III Imagined. In 2022, Fike became a cast member of the second season of Euphoria in his first main acting role as Elliot.

Dominic David Fike was born on December 30, 1995, in Naples, Florida. Fike grew up with a younger brother, Alex, a sister, Apple, and an older brother, Sean, and is of African-American, Filipino, and Haitian descent. Fike went to Estero High School and graduated in 2014. Fike was a fan of Jack Johnson, Blink-182, and Red Hot Chili Peppers. He first acquired a guitar at the age of ten and learned how to play songs by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

During his childhood, Fike recalled that he and his brothers had to take care of each other owing to his parents' frequent absence from his life. Throughout his childhood, Fike’s mother was in and out of jail, causing him to stay in different homes, including those of his older brother, relatives, or his parents' friends. Fike's childhood life was ""full of adventure,"" as he and his friends would spend time in a forested area near their neighborhood that they called the ""Forest of Avalon,"" where he said they would eat snacks and smoke cannabis. He and his older brother Sean would also hang out at the guest house of his friend Stefan’s home, called the ""Backhouse,"" where they would freestyle. Later, they coalesced into a formal rap collective that included members Slyte, Ike Lysergic, and Seno. They attracted an audience in the community and Fike formed a sub-group called Lame Boys ENT. In 2015, the group started to attract the local media's attention and got booked into music festivals.

Fike started uploading songs on the Internet in high school and the first song he uploaded on YouTube was a song called ""Not A Word"". He also put songs he recorded into tapes. Fike briefly enrolled in a college but dropped out in less than 3 days.

Fike first received recognition by making beats with his then producer, Hunter Pfeiffer (known as 54) leading to several popular songs on SoundCloud being published. He released his debut EP at the age of 21 in December 2017 as an independent artist, which was recorded while he was on house arrest for the battery of a police officer. He later went to serve time at Collier County Jail for violating that house arrest. The EP caught the attention of several record labels and sparked a bidding war. After being released in April 2018, he signed with Columbia for a reported $4 million in August. All his previous work including the EP was pulled from all streaming services during the bidding war. Fike said the ultimate decision to join a record label was to pay for his mother's lawyer fee, who was facing drug charges at the time.

The EP was released again by Columbia on October 16, 2018. ""3 Nights"" was released as a single the same year. The single gained wide attention and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. It had an acoustic guitar sound compared to the music of Jack Johnson. It was placed on rotation on several radio stations and Spotify playlists and received favorable reviews from outlets such as Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, and Billboard. In reference to the EP, Billboard described Fike as a ""genre-meshing"" artist, and later named him a breakout act to watch, calling ""3 Nights"" a ""Motown-tinged breakout track"" that is ""trend-proof and irresistible"".

In January 2019, Fike revealed he was working on an album. On April 4, 2019, Brockhampton uploaded a video to their YouTube channel called ""This is Dominic Fike"" which included his song ""3 Nights"". As of April 2019, multiple collaborations with Brockhampton's Kevin Abstract have been posted, reaching over 4 million views.

On June 7, 2019, he released two singles, ""Açaí Bowl"" and ""Rollerblades"". He followed these with another single, ""Phone Numbers,"" produced by Kenny Beats, on July 4, 2019. The music video for this song was released on October 15, 2019. Fike announced on July 9, 2019, that he would be going on a tour titled Rain or Shine later in the year. The North American leg of the tour began August 31 in Philadelphia and ended October 3 in Los Angeles. In September 2019, he announced that he would be doing a clothing collaboration with Marc Jacobs. On the fifth day of that month, he performed a song that was unreleased at the time, Chicken Tenders, at a Chicago concert during his Rain or Shine tour.

Fike is featured on the track Dominic's Interlude on Halsey's third album, Manic, which was released on January 17, 2020. On June 26, 2020, Chicken Tenders, the first single from his then yet-to-be-named debut album, was released. On July 9, he released the single ""Politics & Violence"" and announced that his debut album What Could Possibly Go Wrong would be released on July 31. On August 7, 2020, Fike was the subject of the second episode of The New York Times Presents. In September 2020, Fike became a headliner for the Fortnite concert series. In March 2021, he was featured in the song Die For You by Justin Bieber on his sixth studio album Justice. In August 2021, it was announced that Fike had joined the cast of the HBO teen drama Euphoria for its second season.

92,92,slow pulp,673364,16345386,"The dreamy songs of Midwest indie rock outfit Slow Pulp draw on moody shoegaze, hooky grunge, and intimate lo-fi fare. The band made their full-length debut with Moveys in 2020.
Guitarist Henry Stoehr, bass player Alexander Leeds, and drummer Theodore Mathews started making music together as friends in the sixth grade, naming their first band from letters in their first names. It wasn't until high school, when Emily Massey contributed guitar and backing vocals to later incarnation Slow Pulp's second EP, 2017's EP2, that an improved vision of the band clicked. They soon made Massey lead singer and took down a debut EP that didn't involve her.

Now a four-piece, the group worked up the stand-alone tracks ""At Home"" and ""Steel Birds,"" which they self-released in 2018 while relocating to Chicago. Written and mostly recorded in a cabin in Michigan in January 2019, the Big Day EP followed in May 2019. Slow Pulp headed out on tour with Alex G later in the year, as they worked on their full-length debut. The project was not without obstacles; material was scrapped, and Massey struggled with her own health problems before returning to Madison to help her parents recover from a car accident. The COVID-19 pandemic soon limited travel. With Stoehr acting as main engineer, producer, and mixer, they were able to complete the album long-distance. (Massey's father, Michael, contributed an instrumental piano track.) Titled Moveys, it arrived on Winspear in October 2020. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Slow+Pulp"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

94,94,claire rosinkranz,558490,8173994,"California native Claire Rosinkranz is best known for her lo-fi pop EP BeVerly Hills BoYfRiEnd, which includes Backyard Boy; her massive viral hit. 

Her overnight success might not come as a surprise to all, as Rosinkranz has been writing songs since she was 8. Filling notebooks and iPads with lyrics, turns of phrase, and poems, the homeschooled artist would spend hours writing lyrics to songs that didn’t exist yet. Sometimes, she’d help her musician father, Ragnar, with melodies and lyrics for songs he’d been tasked to compose for TV shows and ad jingles. 

Claire describes her style as alternative blues-pop, equally as inspired by early influences (like The Beatles’ Help!, Frank Ocean, and the Jack Johnson songs the family would listen to around the house) as it is by the singer-songwriter’s contemporaries, like Benee, Bruno Major, and Still Woozy. 

Claire traffics in lo-fi songs with intricate yet totally relatable lyrics about friendship, crushes, family, and feelings. They plumb the depths of the human condition in very short bursts, exposing the songwriter’s remarkable emotional maturity and strong, singular grasp on her sound. Narratively, tracks like “Tough Guy” and “Seriouslaaay” follow Claire’s stories from start to finish while Ragnar’s clean, crisp production buoys his daughter’s crystal-clear vocals. “He totally captures my vision and if I don’t like something, I’m not afraid to say it,” Claire says of her dad. “Because we’re able to communicate so well, the process happens so quickly.”

The “star of the show,” Claire says of her catalogue, is “Backyard Boy,” the final song she wrote for the EP and one that grew legs of its own shortly after release, achieving massive viral success all on its own. “I was getting DMs from people telling me that ‘Backyard Boy’ was doing really well on TikTok,” she remembers. “Then, friends started texting me. Then more people were texting me. So I opened TikTok and I had 300,000 videos under the song and realized, “Oh, this is a thing!”

Signing to slowplay/Republic Records in 2020, Claire realized the work and dedication she’d been putting into music for half her life was coming to fruition. In August, she shot the “Backyard Boy” music video but kept things close to the family, as she’s done for years (it’s directed by her uncle, the first AD is her cousin, and close family friends star alongside her onscreen). “I think people are connecting to that song because it’s about a feeling you long for, especially during this time,” she says. “Everyone wants to have this experience but it’s something we can’t have right now because of COVID. But ‘Backyard Boy’ makes you feel like you can.”

Claire has spent a few years drilling down on her craft by refining her songwriting and learning to play instruments like the ukulele, the piano, and the jazz electric guitar (“that’s the one I absolutely enjoy the most,” she says), which have helped her turn her lyrics into fully imagined soundscapes. “I consider myself a writer first and foremost,” she’s quick to note. “I’m super fortunate to be able to sing all my songs, and I want to sing them, but writing is my favorite part of the entire process.” <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Claire+Rosinkranz"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His father, Rusty, is a real estate appraiser, and his mother, Susan Pillsbury, is a special education teacher in Cape Elizabeth. He now resides in Los Angeles, California.

American pop singer and songwriter who began to make waves in the music industry with the release of his 2017 EP Arizona In The Summer. 2019 marked his first performance at the Lollapalooza music festival. He has since released three EPs, one studio album, and a series of singles.

He intended on pursuing a career in film prior to becoming a musician. A skiing and skating accident drew Pillsbury into a depression, which stunted his desire to make music.

As a child, he was heavily inspired by Elvis Presley and would perform for his family while dressed as him. Throughout high school, he took an interest in film, and in 2016, he moved to Pittsburgh to major in film at Point Park University. During his freshman year, he broke his wrist due to a skiing accident at Sugarloaf Mountain and later broke his wrist again due to a skateboarding accident. While he was stuck in his dorm, two of his friends left music equipment in his dorm, prompting him to record several rap mixtapes while learning how to use Logic Pro. He soon dropped out of college after his grades started to fall.

ROLE MODEL began rapping in 2016 under the mononym Tucker, and released his debut mixtape, Since When. He soon changed his stage name to DILLIS, and self-released his debut album ""Moth"" in June 2016. That same month, he performed at a show at the Maine State Pier, and he later performed as an opener for Lil Debbie during her 2016 U.S. tour.

In early 2017, he changed his stage name to ROLE MODEL and switched from rapping to singing. He self-released his debut EP, ARIZONA IN THE SUMMER, in December 2017 after recording it in his closet, which earned him a following online. After hearing the EP, rapper Mac Miller invited ROLE MODEL to Los Angeles for the two to work together. He was signed to Interscope Records in 2018. A music video for his song ""play the part"" was released in November 2018. His single ""minimal"" was released in May 2019 along with a music video.

On August 25, 2022, he released the single ""cross your mind"" alongside an official music video. He released another single ""a little more time"" on February 17, 2023, with a music video shot and directed by his girlfriend Emma Chamberlain.

ROLE MODEL took his name from Paul Rudd's character in the 2008 film ""Role Models"". He often plays acoustic guitar in his songs, and his music has been described as pop and bedroom pop. He has called Mac Miller an inspiration of his due to his influence on the city of Pittsburgh, and called meeting him ""the most pivotal moment in his life"". Critics have described his lyrics, which discuss topics such as sex, mental health, and relationships, as ""relatable"" and ""confessional"". Throughout his career, Pillsbury has been very open about mental health issues and his own depression.

He was signed to Benny Blanco's Mad Love Records label. He is close friends with fellow artist Omar Apollo. As of 2019, he is based in Hollywood. He was previously in a relationship with American social media influencer and model Emma Chamberlain. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Role+Model"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He founded the indie rock band Mo Lowda & The Humble in 2010 and due to its intense touring schedule, the band became his main priority along with his side project NightSeason (founded 2016)- an indie/electro-pop producer duo. Though he always felt writing folk songs was his true “wheelhouse”, it wasn’t until the nationwide lockdown in early 2020 that he finally put aside the time to record a collection of those songs for his first solo album ‘Only Real When Shared’. The album (due out October 2nd, 2020) was entirely recorded during quarantine with producer/engineer/drummer Shane Woods, with whom Caiola previously co-produced all the Mo Lowda records as well as Arson Daily’s 2020 LP ‘Late Reflections.’ Caiola’s debut album highlights every aspect of his vocal spectrum and strips down instrumental elements to direct focus towards the lyrical content much more than on previous efforts. Jangly acoustic guitars, lo-fi drums, and lush harmonies makeup the bulk of this record, with sit-ins from multiple additional musicians sprinkled throughout. Caiola is set to release a new single every 2 weeks starting July 24th up until the full album comes out October 2nd, 2020. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Caiola"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

128,128,neil frances,496161,7216685,"The duo behind Neil Frances come from two different worlds, and yet their union sounds destined. Jordan Feller and Marc Gilfry first met in 2012. It wasn’t until four years later that Jordan called Marc to lend vocals to some demos, which were intended as a placeholder. As with the best of accidents, the two liked what they heard and Neil Frances was born.

Jordan grew up in Sydney, then spent time in London, before landing in Los Angeles. Marc, a California native, grew up outside of Los Angeles in Rancho Cucamonga, in a house across the street from his aunt, uncle and cousin. Since childhood, the two found themselves exposed to a range of music, from opera, disco, hip-hop and more, all of which informs their songwriting today.

These influences can be heard on Neil Frances’ dreamy debut EP, Took A While, consisting of five lustrous, reverberating dance tracks featuring one infectious melody after the other. Their sound caught the attention of Jungle and Poolside, who they toured with earlier this year. When the music discovery platform, The Wild Honey Pie first heard their music, they quickly invited them to play the launch of their Los Angeles dinner party series (held in early November) at Checker Hall. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Frances"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

131,131,bombay bicycle club,1511613,49170034,"Bombay Bicycle Club is a British band formed in North London, United Kingdom in 2006. In January 2016, the four members announced that they would pursue solo projects. Ed Nash has since then been recording music under the name Toothless, releasing his debut album in early 2017, and former frontman Steadman has been recording under the name Mr Jukes, releasing a debut single in March 2017. 

The band was formed by Jack Steadman (vocals, guitar, bass), Jamie MacColl (bass, guitar, banjo, vocals), Suren De Saram (drums) under the name of The Canals when they were 15. Ed Nash (bass, keyboard, mandolin) later joined the trio as they switched between various aliases before picking Bombay Bicycle Club. The band took their name from a chain of curry houses in the London Area and have released four studio albums, ""I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose"" (2009), ""Flaws"" (2010), ""A Different Kind Of Fix"" (2011) and ""So long, See You tomorrow"" (2014).

After winning the opening slot at V Festival 2006 ('Road to V' competition) and also played Reading / Leeds Festival for the three years running, in Febuary 2007 they released their début EP The Boy I Used To Be. This was followed up in October with the release of their second EP How We Are. In mid-July of 2009 they released their first album I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose consisting of 12 tracks. The album peaked at number 46 on the UK Official Album Charts.

In Summer 2010 they released their second album, Flaws . A UK tour co-incided with the release of the album which - surprisingly - is an acoustic recording. Venues on the tour reflected this new acoustic orientation, which gained them a number 8 on the album charts.

The lead single from their third album, A Different Kind Of Fix was released on June 23, 2011 and peaked at  #40 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in the United States, the band's first chart appearance in the country. The album reached the number 6 position on the UK album charts.  
The band added Amber Wilson to their live party as an additional keyboardist and background vocalist. Singer/songwriter Lucy Rose also joined the live performances on vocals, after featuring on several songs from the albums ""Flaws"" and ""A Different Kind of Fix"".

On November 5th, 2013 ""Carry me"" was released as an advance of their fourth studio album through Island Records. ""Luna"" was the second single to be extracted from the album ""So long, see you tomorrow"" which coveted the band their first UK number 1.

After a long 6-year hiatus, the band made a comeback in 2020 with ""Everything Else Has Gone Wrong"", their fifth record. The album was released on January 16th via Mmm... Records, with eleven tracks.

""We’re thrilled to say that our 5th album, Everything Else Has Gone Wrong, is out now.

When we started discussing the possibility of making another record after our a few years away as a band, we said we’d only release an album if we were confident that it stood up to our previous work. We’ve ended up with an album we’re really proud of, and we hope you agree that it’s been worth the 6-year wait.

Recording this one was definitely one of the most enjoyable recording processes we’ve had as a band. Working with John Congleton, we had an initial session in London in early Spring last year at Konk studio, where we’d done our first and fourth albums. We then went to LA in late Summer to record the majority of it with John. Spending 3 weeks in LA was an unforgettable experience for the four of us. It was the first extended period of time we’d spent together in a long while and reinforced what we’d been missing during these few years. We hope that positive energy that was there during those 3 weeks has translated onto the record.

We’ve touched previously on how the album is about the comfort that music can provide in times of need. Hopefully, this record can give you that escape should you ever need it.

We want to get to as many places as possible to play these new songs for you. Wherever you are in the world, fingers crossed we’ll see you soon.

Lots of love

134,134,haux,299936,2764612,"Haux is an American modern indie folk singer-songwriter and producer known for his dreamy fusion of indie electronic, pop, and folk music. Woodson Black, the artist behind Haux, was born and raised in the Berkshires, Massachusetts, where he was collectively raised by his mother and her five sisters. The family faced challenges such as cancer, substance abuse, and tragic losses, which had a profound impact on Haux's life and musical expression.

After attending Northeastern University in Boston, Black pursued an internship at a record label in London, England. There, he immersed himself in the music scene, exploring various aspects such as writing, photography, and composing. Haux began his career by recording tracks and sharing them on SoundCloud, eventually releasing his first digital EP, ""The Bluest Sage,"" on December 8, 2014. In 2016, he released his debut physical EP, ""All We've Known,"" on Akira Records, drawing comparisons to artists like Bon Iver, C Duncan, and Benjamin Francis Leftwich.

Over the following years, Haux continued to release dreamy singles such as ""Touch,"" ""Youth,"" and ""Cologne,"" which were later compiled into his 2018 EP, ""Something to Remember."" However, during a European tour after the EP's release, Haux experienced severe anxiety, prompting him to take a break from music and confront his formative trauma.

On July 17, 2020, Haux released his debut full-length album, ""Violence in a Quiet Mind."" The album delves into the themes of family struggles with substance abuse, trauma, and the importance of confronting personal demons for healing. Through introspective and deeply personal songs, Haux reflects on the loss of loved ones, particularly his aunts, and the generational struggle with addiction within his family.

The album was recorded on the Isle of Harris in Scotland, a place significant to Haux's mother, creating an isolated and emotionally charged environment for channeling his feelings. Co-produced by Jamie Macneal and Thomas Bartlett, the album maintains an intimate atmosphere that captures the raw emotions and vulnerability of Haux's storytelling.

Haux hopes that ""Violence in a Quiet Mind"" will spark conversations about mental health, addiction, and the importance of honesty and empathy. By sharing his own experiences and struggles, Haux aims to provide solace and support for listeners as they confront their own challenges and seek healing from past traumas. The album invites audiences on an intimate and contemplative journey, encouraging self-reflection and embracing the power of healing through music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/HAUX"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Raine has been composing soundtracks for games and media for 12 years, her breakout moment coming with her work on the classic PC game Guild Wars 2. Her most celebrated work, however, has come in the form of 2018’s Celeste (Original Soundtrack). A game based around themes of anxiety, self-examination and more, Celeste is considered by many to be the key indie game of 2018, and has won multiple awards for both game and soundtrack - something which Raine painstakingly developed in tandem with the game’s design since its first steps.

A flagship year for Raine was capped off in December, when she performed live with soundtrack legend Hans Zimmer at The Game Awards, the video game industry's flagship annual award show (Celeste was nominated for four awards, and won two).

Raine released her debut album Oneknowing on March 29, 2019.

After a 24 hour flight taking him to the other side of the world, Jordan came straight to the pool hall to bring in the New Year with Rhythm Section. This is where the journey began. 

By 2016, Jordan was able to immerse himself into the London scene, winning plaudits from countless tastemakers and thousands of fans along the way. He sold out a European Tour, shared stages and studios with musical greats and released one of the most acclaimed albums of 2016 - the fact that he did this all by himself (with the help of a few friends) cements the fact that Jordan is a future great in the making. His output is relentless, his imagination; boundless. For a musician so unconstrained by style, one moniker would never suffice. Enter Dan Kye: Jordan’s stripped back electronic alias. 

In 2016, Jordan Rakei released his first Dan Kye project: Joy, Ease, Lightness, a 4 track EP aimed squarely at the dancefloor, but with a meditative awareness that reaches far beyond the club. He would then follow this up four years later with his debut full-length album under the name called Small Moments. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Kye"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

142,142,caribou,1282121,42461740,"There is more than one artist with this name, including: 
1) Caribou is Canadian Dan Snaith (b. 1978); 
2) Caribou was a French band active in the 1970s; 
3) Caribou is a New Zealand band from Dunedin/Ōtepoti.  

1) Caribou is Canadian Dan Snaith (born Daniel Victor Snaith on 29 March 1978), who formerly recorded under the moniker Manitoba. Known for altering his sound with each subsequent release, he incorporates electronic psychedelia, krautrock rhythms, and breakbeat drums and creates a swirling, lush, musical panorama. Snaith also creates more club-oriented dance music under the name Daphni. 
Snaith grew up in Dundas, Ontario, Canada, which gave its name to a song from his debut album Start Breaking My Heart. He studied at the University of Toronto as an undergrad, but was based in the UK for several years until he completed his Ph.D. in mathematics at the Imperial College, London in 2005. 
Snaith previously recorded under the stage name ""Manitoba"", but changed it under threat of a lawsuit by Handsome ""Dick"" Manitoba, frontman for The Dictators, a punk-rocker with an appetite for litigation. Uninterested in the legal stoush, Snaith is quoted saying that he chose the new moniker ""Caribou"" while on an LSD trip with friends in the Canadian wilderness. He then climbed a tree and didn't come down until he finished his first album under the new moniker, which was four months later. 
He has recorded five full-lengths: Start Breaking My Heart, a jazzy, ""folktronica"" IDM album, Up in Flames, the critically acclaimed shoegazer with analog synths and sometimes live, sometimes sampled drums, The Milk of Human Kindness, his krautrock-inspired album that bleeds 70's prog and 70's drugscapes, the psychedelic pop record, Andorra which landed him the prestigious 2008 Polaris Music Prize on September 29th, 2008 and Swim a disco / dance inspired album created from the idea of making dance music that sounds like being under water. A few years prior to the recording of the album, Snaith's wife gave him swimming lessons as a Christmas present, prompting him to take it up as a new hobby. This partially led to the eventual ideology behind Swim. 
His eclectic live performances are renowned, in part for their use of simultaneous drummers and synchronised visuals.  The live band currently consists of Dan Snaith (guitar, keyboards, vocals, drums, flutophone), Ryan Smith (guitar, keyboards), Brad Weber (drums) and John Schmersal (bass, vocals). 

2) Caribou was a French band active in the 1970s. The band released ""Californie"" in 1977. 

3) Caribou is a New Zealand band from Dunedin/Ōtepoti.  The band released their debut single, ""Big 18"", in 2023. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Caribou"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Una combinación explosiva. En 2019 Mateo vuelve quedar en boca de todos con “La mexicana”, un single que al ritmo de una ranchera rockera aborda el desamor y se sigue acercando al oido popular.

147,147,marina,1722500,124452469,"There are several artists with this name: 

1) Marina Lambrini Diamandis, known mononymously as Marina and previously by the stage name Marina & the Diamonds, is a Welsh singer and songwriter.

Born in Brynmawr to a Welsh mother and Greek father, Diamandis was raised in Abergavenny and moved to London as a teenager to become a professional singer, despite having little formal musical experience. In 2009, she came to prominence upon placing second in the BBC's Sound of 2010. Her debut studio album, The Family Jewels (2010), incorporated indie pop and new wave musical styles. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number five and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. The album's second single, ""Hollywood"", peaked at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart. Her follow-up record, Electra Heart (2012), was a concept album about a character of the same name which became her first number one project in the United Kingdom. The album was certified gold in the US and UK, with its singles ""Primadonna"" and ""How to Be a Heartbreaker"" becoming international hits.

Diamandis' synthpop-inspired third studio album, Froot  (2015), became her third top 10 album in the UK and her first top 10 entry on the US Billboard 200, where it charted at number 8. Produced entirely by Diamandis and David Kosten, it was praised for its cohesive sound and introspective lyrical content. Her fourth studio album, Love + Fear, was released on April 26, 2019. The album charted at number five on the UK album chart. She released her fifth studio album, Ancient Dreams in a Modern Land, on June 11, 2021 which charted at number 17 in the UK.

2) Marina Lima started her career in the 1980's using the stage name Marina. Since the 90's she has been using Marina Lima on all of her releases. Lima is a widely popular brazilian singer-songwriter.

Starting her career before brazilian rock of the '80s was commercially ripe, Marina Lima witnessed its creation from a privileged standpoint and participated in it as a successful pop star since 1984. Her most regular partner has been her brother, poet and philosopher Antônio Cícero. Her biggest hits are ""Fullgás"" (Marina/Antônio Cícero), ""À Francesa"" (Marina/Antônio Cícero), ""Pra Começar"" (Marina/Antônio Cícero), ""Nada Por Mim"" (Herbert Viana/Paula Toller), ""Eu Te Amo Você"" (Kiko Zambianchi), ""Ainda É Cedo,"" ""Não Sei Dançar,"" and ""Uma Noite e Meia."" Her eclectic repertory features rock-tinged pop-dance music, blues, bossa nova, a typical samba-canção melancholy, and a very tiny pinch of jazz.

From five to 12, she lived in the USA where her father worked, and was taught to read in English before Portuguese. Attracted to psychoanalysis and music, Marina Lima (just Marina by then; she added her surname to her stage name in the '90s) started to write songs, opting for making a living in this career when Gal Costa recorded her ""Meu Doce Amor"" in 1977. The next year she formed a band that had a drummer who would be connected with the creation and the development of the Brazilian rock of the '80s, Lobão. Ricardo Barreto (guitar), Guto Barros (guitar), Zé Luís (sax), and Junno Homrich (bass) would also participate in that historic moment (they later became musicians of the seminal Brazilian rock band Blitz) as they were also in her band before the new genre took Brazil. Marina's first solo album, Simples Como Fogo (1979), already brought originals in the pop/rock style that would become mainstream in the next decade. But her first hit came in 1984, with ""Fullgás,"" which had success with the title track ""Me Chama"" (Lobão) and ""Mesmo que Seja Eu"" (Roberto Carlos/Erasmo Carlos, here having its meaning altered as a confession of her bisexuality). Three years later, she appeared in the film Rádio Pirata (Lael Rodrigues) singing the main theme, which she also composed. With 15 albums released in Brazil as 2000, others were launched especially for the American market and dominated a period in which anxiety provoked a loss of voice; Marina Lima is one of the biggest divas of Brazilian rock.

3) Marina Luchenko-Szczesna (Polish: Marina Łuczenko-Szczęsna; Ukrainian: Марина Лученко–Ще́нсний; born 3 July 1989), known mononymously as Marina (stylized as MaRina), is a Ukrainian-Polish singer-songwriter and actress. 

4) Marina Vénache, known as Marina on stage, is a French singer born on October 30, 1985. She started her career in the sixth season of the TV show ""Star Academy"" in 2006. 

5) Marina Marqueza (currently using the name Marqueza) is a non-binary Japanese-Venezuelan artist, singer, and producer based in Salt Lake City, Utah making genre-fluid music from the bottom of their heart. They want to see the Salt Lake City art scene become more radically inclusive of the diversity of talent that already exists, and they put that intentionality behind every event they agree or refuse to be a part of. Marina loves Existimos, Patty and Graciela, and she wants to perform a set that is affirming and healing from their place as a queer person of color. Her debut album, Orbit Pluto, was released on January 1, 2019. 

6) Marina, a Czech metalcore band from Prague.

7) Marina Nakamura(中村 真里奈, Nakamura Marina, born February 7, 1987) is a Japanese singer and songwriter from Miyazaki who is signed to 5pb. Marina debuted in 2010 singing songs for the anime television series Angel Beats! as one of two vocalists for the fictional band Girls Dead Monster.

LaMontagne has released eight studio albums, Trouble, Till the Sun Turns Black, Gossip in the Grain, God Willin' & the Creek Don't Rise, Supernova, Ouroboros, Part of the Light, and Monovision. He was born in New Hampshire and was inspired to create music after hearing an album by Stephen Stills. Critics have compared LaMontagne's music to that of Otis Redding, The Band, Van Morrison, Nick Drake and Tim Buckley.

Early life
LaMontagne was born in Nashua, New Hampshire, in 1973, one of six children raised by his mother. In his early teens he lived in Morgan, Utah, and was more interested in drawing images of Dungeons & Dragons than in his school work. After graduating from high school, LaMontagne moved to Lewiston, Maine, and found work in a shoe factory. LaMontagne also spent a significant amount of time in Wilton, Maine. Other sources state that by his teen years he was living in Maine, spending time in Turner and Buckfield.

Style
LaMontagne has a unique vocal style which he says is created by singing through his gut instead of through his nose. He cites Stephen Stills, Richard Manuel, and Rick Danko as strong musical influences while critics have compared LaMontagne's music to that of The Band, Van Morrison, Nick Drake, and Tim Buckley.[failed verification] A Rolling Stone review of his album Supernova referred to his voice as an ""impeccably weathered tenor croon"" and his phrasing as ""marble-mouthed.""

Awards
For his debut album, LaMontagne won four awards, including three Boston Music Awards (Best Male Singer-Songwriter, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year) and an XM Nation Music Award for Acoustic Rock Artist of the Year. LaMontagne has received a nomination from the Pollstar Concert Industry Awards for Best New Touring Artist, the BRIT Awards for International Breakthrough Act, the MOJO Awards for Best New Act, and was given the title of Best Voice in 2006 by Esquire.

In 2011, Ray LaMontagne and the Pariah Dogs received two Grammy Award nominations, and they were awarded the Grammy for the Best Contemporary Folk Album for God Willin' & the Creek Don't Rise.

Controversy
On July 23, 2014, during a show at the Meijer Gardens in Grand Rapids, Michigan, LaMontagne interrupted a song and walked off stage as a result of two fans talking during his concert, after having previously asked the audience to quiet down. The incident included yelling profanity at the couple before walking off stage. Once the couple was escorted away LaMontagne continued the concert.

On September 20, 2016, LaMontagne announced that he was canceling a September 22 show at the Bass Concert Hall at the University of Texas at Austin, due to Texas's recently implemented campus carry law.

Personal life
In 2009, LaMontagne paid $1.05 million for a 103-acre farm in Ashfield, Massachusetts, the former residence of U.S. Ambassador William C. Bullitt, where he lives with his wife, Sarah Sousa, and their two children in the farmhouse built in 1830. Sousa is a published poet via Red Mountain Press and their sons are budding artists.

Musically reminiscent at times of Bon Iver’s atmosphere heavy For Emma, Forever Ago or the Grateful Dead’s “Mountains of the Moon” from their 1969 release Aoxomoxoa, the sonic landscape of the band's album Seven Sisters is sparse but far from empty.  On tracks like “Khima,” “Borderline” and “Brother, Sister,” the slow scrawl of the banjo melody floats through the song and surrounds you like birdsong, coming at you predictably but surprisingly from several directions at once.  Each of the songs on this album stays with you, forming a soundtrack for and changing the shape of the rest of your day.

It’s appropriate that a debut album concern itself with creation and Seven Sisters is no exception.  Whether it is the creation of love and a place for that love, as the narrative of the album suggests; or the creation of the universe, as the album’s title and repetition of astronomical and astrological imagery suggests; Beta Radio’s lyrics and music carve out a space in your head and find a way to fit into your own cosmology.

Lyrically, Seven Sisters explores religion, albeit from a couch rather than a pulpit.  The religious allusions are subtle and unobtrusive, concerning themselves more with mysticism than proselytization, much like David Eugene Edwards’ 16 Horsepower and Wovenhand.

Line for line, the lyrics are beautiful and surprising.  In “A Place for Me” the lines “I wanted not to fight / With my heart but I’ll fight with my fists all night” evoke the heartache of leaving, of lovers’ spats of loss and regret.

The album leaves you with a simple but urgent lyric refrain in “Return to Darden Road”– “Where do you go? / Come back to me / ‘Cause I love you so.” Review by deckfight <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Beta+Radio"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

156,156,grandson,679367,19666359,"Grandson is an alternative artist hailing from Toronto, Canada. Born in the small town of Englewood New Jersey, he relocated to the cultural melting pot of Toronto at a young age, and grew up surrounded by music ranging from jazz to rock and roll to rap, dancehall and r&b. He began playing guitar and piano in high school.

At 17, he relocated to Montreal, QC to attend university, and began working in nightclubs cleaning tables and DJing. He started writing music at this time, incorporating the unique blend of sounds he grew up surrounded by. He started experimenting with music production and rapping in 2013, and dropped out of school to relocate to Los Angeles and pursue music full time.

Adopting the Grandson moniker while living in LA, he dove deeply into rock influences such as Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana, and Led Zeppelin, while also listening to rap/R&B music emerging out of Toronto and alternative acts such as Twenty One Pilots and Hiatus Kaiyote. He found a small community of musicians to work and perform with here in Los Angeles. The live tries to create a frantic, mosh pit-inducing cathartic release of energy for concert-goers, influenced by early punk and grunge music.

Searching for his voice and for meaning in today’s divisive, chaotic world, Grandson confronts the most pressing issues of his generation through his songwriting, such as financial inequality, governmental and environmental accountability, and social justice, giving these topics a soundtrack with a genuine sense of urgency and frustration. The music also touches on adolescence, relationships, and the insecurities and difficulties of growing up through your 20s. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Grandson"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

159,159,miami horror,723338,12456351,"Miami Horror are an Australian indie-electronic band from Melbourne, Australia (with the name referring to producer, Benjamin Plant, and to the four-piece live incarnation). Beginning in  2007 under the moniker Miami Horror, Plant started with a series of remixes. The debut release came in 2008 with a five-track EP, Bravado, on Virgin Records. The live show has Plant augmented by Josh Moriarty (Peacocks, ex-Young & Restless) (guitars), DJ/producer Aaron Shanahan (drums), and Daniel Whitechurch (bass, keyboards, and guitars).

After years in the making here at last is Illumination, the fully realised debut album from Melbourne's favourite psychedelic indie-electronic adventurers Miami Horror. With Illumination, Miami Horror has delivered on two years of teeth-cutting live shows and an ever escalating wave of buzz that’s made the group bonafide blog darlings the world over. But what’s most amazing about the grand arrival of Illumination is that the roots of the record stretch back countless moons to when Miami Horror began as just one synthesizer-obsessed producer in 2007 huddled over a laptop in a bedroom-come-studio and the album itself just a spark waiting to be lit.

The afore mentioned synth tragic was, and let’s face it still is, electronic young gun Ben Plant, who kick started Miami Horror out of a love of Roland keyboards and French house, landing himself on Pitchfork’s hot-list overnight and copping a barrage of high profile remix requests from the likes of Datarock, PNAU and The Presets.

Yet it was while Ben was punching out 2008’s epochal Bravado EP that Miami Horror took off in a completely new and different direction. Characteristically wanting to flex his creative muscle and avoid the limitations of being stereotyped as simply a dance or electro act, Ben rewired Miami Horror’s genetic makeup, deputising the talents of Josh Moriarty, Aaron Shanahan and Daniel Whitechurch to form a new live band persona of Miami Horror, a whole new beast immeasurably more exciting than before.

“It started out that I didn’t want to have any guitar on the album besides a little funk guitar or disco bass,” Ben grins while explaining the turning point for Miami Horror’s evolution. “But then Josh came in and started playing all these other parts that sounded amazing. Paired with what I was working on, nobody was doing anything like it, so I knew we had to turn those sounds into a live thing and just go wild.”

It worked. Since the switch, Miami Horror has launched into dizzying new stratospheres, their well-polished chops as a group making for some unmissable sets at Australia’s biggest festivals, and that’s not to mention some A-list support slot call ups for everyone from Phoenix, Friendly Fires and La Roux to a hand-picked hook up from Lily Allen.

165,165,wallners,45449,377145,"he amazing dream pop of four Viennese siblings is called: Wallners
Had they not grown up under one roof, the four Wallners, Nino, Max and the twins Anna and Laurenz, would never have ended up in a band; so they tell us with a laugh. Daft Punk as their favourite band is about the only thing they can agree on -and they are already working on tracks that would make the two French electronics legends dance. At the moment though, the music of the newcomers Wallners is much more reminiscent of the soundtrack to a daydream, which entices you into mystical parallel worlds and that lets feelings set the pace, especiallythe feeling of longing. Wallners evoke the gentle, seductive sounds of Rhye, the heartbreak of a James Blake and a Lana Del Rey in the way they work and remind us of two other siblings that are on everyone’s lips: Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas. Due to their closeness and familiarity Wallners also don’t have to discuss much with each other; they understand each other blindly and produce at home.

But the four Wallner siblings do have something in common: they are all great tinkerers & creative minds who work on individual songs for up to a year -not so much by adding layer to layer, butquite the contrary, by exposing the core of the songs. It is a music of reduction, of condensed, substantial minimalism. Carried by Anna Wallner’s hypnotic voice, Wallners prove that tenderness and force don’t have to be mutually exclusive. The songs envelop the listeners, who immediately get carried away by the arrangements, just like with a lullaby. The Wallners are excited to present their amazingly dreamlike music to the world. Their first EP is called “Prolog 1” and is out now, on Universal Music Austria. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Wallners"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

While Shanice accompanies herself expressively and rhythmically on acoustic guitar, it's her rich, euphonious vocals that truly heal hearts.

It was on a trip to her hometown of Easton, Texas where Shanice found the inspiration for her most recent songs. The quiet simplicity of the country fields, front porches, and dirt roads brought her back to her blues roots. She returned to her current home of Atlanta, Georgia with songs inspired by listening to Bobby Bland, Johnnie Taylor, and Jimmy Reed. Though listeners often compare her to the likes of India.Arie, Corinne Bailey Rae, and Tracy Chapman, Shanice credits artists such as Jason Mraz and Jack Johnson as musical influences. Shanice's ""charismatic personality, and smooth, soulful voice"" will be put on display this summer as she hosts several intimate acoustic shows, and releases live versions of her new songs.

173,173,vansire,1434224,31111397,"Vansire is a dream pop band from Rochester, Minnesota consisting of Josh Augustin and Sam Winemiller. They are currently signed to Spirit Goth Records. Vansire has performed at ROCKChester and First Avenue, played a live session with Audiotree, and collaborated with artists such as Chester Watson, Jeremiah Jae, and Mick Jenkins.

Vansire formed as band members Josh Augustin (vocals, synths, guitar, and drums) and Sam Winemiller (bass, guitar, and synths) were attending Century High School in Rochester, Minnesota. Augustin and Winemiller met while playing together on the school's drumline and continued to find themselves performing together through school activities (such as concert band and pit orchestra), something the duo says contributed to their creative synergy and friendship, which later helped in Vansire's formation.

In the summer of 2015, Winemiller approached Augustin after practice for the school's drumline with an idea to make a band ""that sounds like Mac [DeMarco]"". The pair's early recordings were made by holding instruments to the internal microphone of an iPad running GarageBand. Augustin and Winemiller, initially unsure of what to call their new project, turned to an online random word generator that landed on ""vansire"", an alternative name for the Marsh mongoose. From there, the two continued to record together in their basements, living rooms, and bedrooms under the new Vansire moniker.

In August 2016, Vansire self-released their first album, ""Reflections and Reveries"". The duo recorded the album entirely in Winemiller's basement in a roughly one-year period from August 2015 to August 2016, and included Winemiller's brother, Issac, on bass for some songs.

During this time, Augustin began studying at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and Oberlin College, while Winemiller started at the University of Minnesota. Despite the distance, the duo vowed to remain committed to the Vansire project, now describing it as ""a long-distance band relationship.""

Vansire released their second album Angel Youth in April 2018 on Spirit Goth Records. Augustin and Winemiller produced and mastered the album themselves, and it is the band's first full-length album that featured collaborations with other artists.

In June 2019, the duo released their single ""Metamodernity"", also recording an Audiotree Live session at Audiotree's studios in Chicago later that August.

In July 2020, Vansire released ""Central Time"", a single featuring Chicago-based rapper Mick Jenkins in their first collaboration together. In an interview announcing the single, Augustin said the single began as an instrumental demo that Winemiller sent him in September 2019, which sat untouched for roughly eight months until the duo returned back to it, finishing it up at the beginning of June 2020.

During this period of the band's history, Augustin said that Vansire found itself leaning in an ""increasingly dance-oriented direction"" with regard to musical sound and that the duo has started to draw influence from more ""dancey, funk-imbued music"".

On October 16, 2020, Vansire released ""After Fillmore County"", a seven-song EP that brought back FLOOR CRY, and featured Philadelphia-based rapper Ivy Sole. In April 2021, Vansire released a remix of Sydney-based producer-artist Swaine Delgado's ""F Me Up"", their first remix.

Initial efforts to sign with a label failed, leading to the band's manager Jamie Oborne to form Dirty Hit records. The band opened for several major acts and released a series of EPs (Facedown, Sex, Music for Cars, IV) throughout 2012 before releasing their self-titled debut album (2013), which included the popular singles ""Sex"", ""Chocolate"", and ""Robbers"" and reached number 1 in the United Kingdom.

Their second album, 'i like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it' (2016), reached No. 1 in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Following the touring cycle for the record, the band announced their third album under the working title of Music for Cars, before going on hiatus again throughout 2017.

Returning in 2018, the band announced that the album had evolved into their third campaign cycle, consisting of their third and fourth studio albums. The first, 'A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships' (2018), was released to widespread critical acclaim, and became their third No. 1 album in the UK. The second, 'Notes On A Conditional Form', was released in May 2020 and became their fourth consecutive No. 1 album in the UK. Two years later the band released their fifth album 'Being Funny In A Foreign Language' in October 14th 2022.

The 1975 has garnered acclaim for their relevant salacious lyricism and exploration of an eclectic range of genres such as pop rock, synth-pop, R&B, electropop, new wave forms of electronic music (such as UK garage, 2-step and ambient), and forms of rock music (such as shoegaze, post-punk and post-rock), as well as elements of jazz, soul and gospel. there sixth album possibly entitled God Inside My Body could possibly come out sometime in the future. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+1975"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

178,178,colter wall,333494,10678936,"Colter Wall (born June 27, 1995) is a Canadian singer-songwriter from Swift Current, Saskatchewan. His self-titled debut album was released on May 12, 2017.

Wall was familiar with country music growing up as country artists such as Johnny Cash were played at home. He started learning guitar at the age of 13, playing music of rock bands such as AC/DC and Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. Later he became interested in old blues artists, and then started to listen to folk music. According to Wall, he first heard Bob Dylan's song ""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"" around grade 10 or 11 (aged 15 or 16), and he was inspired to start writing and singing songs instead of only playing guitar. Other early musical influences he cited include Woody Guthrie and Ramblin' Jack Elliott, and he had also expressed interest in country singers such as Gram Parsons, Townes Van Zandt, George Jones, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Hank Williams. He made demos of his songs while he was a student, and in 2015, he decided to take a break from his studies at the university to focus on his music career when his first EP was released.

Colter Wall was born in Swift Current, Saskatchewan, the middle child of Tami and Brad Wall, 14th Premier of Saskatchewan. He has two sisters, Megan and Faith. Wall attended Swift Current Comprehensive High School, and graduated in 2013. He then studied at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon.

Wall recorded a seven-song EP, Imaginary Appalachia, in 2015 with Jason Plumb the producer at Studio One in Regina, Saskatchewan. He collaborated on the EP with other artists from Regina such as Belle Plaine and The Dead South. He described his music as a blend of blues, folk and Americana. The EP was released on March 9, 2015, and ""The Devil Wears a Suit and Tie"" was released as his first single. His music gained the attention of Brock Lesnar who helped to raise his profile among wrestling fans. Songs from the album were featured in the television show Dog the Bounty Hunter,[8] and the films Hell or High Water and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. The track used in the films, ""Sleeping on the Blacktop"", gained more than a million streams on Spotify.

In 2016, Wall opened for Lucinda Williams at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. He was signed to Rick Rubin's American Songs publishing company.

His first full-length album, self-titled Colter Wall, was produced by Dave Cobb at the RCA Studio A in Nashville. Wall was accompanied by Cobb on acoustic guitar, Chris Powell on drums, Mike Webb on piano, and Robby Turner on pedal steel. The album was released on May 12, 2017 and according to Wall, most of the songs on the album are autobiographical.

A new album, Songs of the Plains, was announced in July 2018 and was released on October 12, 2018. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Colter+Wall"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Now based in Louisville, Kentucky, Tomberlin released her debut full-length album, ""At Weddings"", in 2018 on Saddle Creek Records. She wrote most of At Weddings while living with her family in southern Illinois during her late teens and early twenties. At 16, she finished her homeschooling curriculum and went to college at a private Christian school she describes, only half-jokingly, as a ""cult."" By 17, she had dropped out of school, returned home, and begun to face a period of difficult transition in her life. The daughter of a Baptist pastor, Tomberlin found herself questioning not only her faith, but her identity, her purpose, and her place in the world. 

""I was working, going to school, and experiencing heavy isolation,"" Tomberlin says of the time when she first began writing the songs on At Weddings. ""It felt monotonous, like endless nothingness. It was a means to get through to the next step of life."" In songwriting, Tomberlin found relief and lucidity she had trouble articulating otherwise. When she was 19, she wrote ""Tornado"" on her parents' piano, and began to develop confidence in her music.

Born in Milan to Tunisian parents, he has always lived in the Lombard capital, spending a good part of his childhood in Baggio, a neighborhood on the outskirts of Milan.
He began to approach rap with the name Fobia, which later became Ghali Foh. In 2011 he founded the Troupe D'Elite, a group which also included the rapper Er Nyah (now known as Ernia), the singer Maite and the producer Fonzie. In the same year he received a call from the rapper Gué Pequeno, who signed him to his label Tanta Roba. Over time, he also made himself known thanks to Fedez, accompanying him on his tour. The following year he released the EP of the same name with the group: critics defined it as one of the lowest points of Italian rap, the group was considered borderline insane. In July 2013 he published Leader Mixtape, collaborating with artists such as Sfera Ebbasta, Maruego and others. A year later, Troupe D'Elite terminated the contract with Tanta Roba and released the album Il mio giorno giorno as independent artists, as a free download on the Honiro platform.

Since 2015 he has continued as a soloist and changed his name, simply becoming Ghali.

On 14 October 2016, through Sto Records, he released the single Ninna nanna on Spotify which set new streaming records, obtaining the highest number of plays on the first day and reaching first position in the Top Singles only thanks to streaming listening, given that the artist decides not to put the single on sale in digital music stores.

195,195,deftones,3396137,378322133,"Deftones is an American  alternative metal band from Sacramento, California, formed in 1988, consisting of Chino Moreno (lead vocals and guitar), Stephen Carpenter (guitar), Frank Delgado (keyboards and turntables), and Abe Cunningham (drums and percussion). Vega (formerly of Quicksand) took on bass duties from mid-2009 to ca. 2021 in substitution for Chi Cheng, who was seriously injured in an automobile accident in Santa Clara, California on November 4, 2008. Cheng remained in a coma until his death on April 13, 2013, due to cardiac arrest. Fred Sablan is their current live bassist starting in 2022. Lance Jackman plays guitar during non-US shows since Stephen Carpenter no longer travels abroad as of 2022.

While they were mostly an alternative metal band in their early years, their sound changed into something more complex and experimental in 2000, as a result, they are often coined today as an alternative rock band. 

Critics have often praised them as one of the closest to unique rock bands of recent years for their innovative, atmospheric music; as Johnny Loftus writes, ""Rock critics usually reserve a special place for Deftones above or at least away from the rest of the turn-of-the-century metal movement [...] Deftones have always seemed more curious, more willing to incorporate traditionally revered sounds like dream pop and DC hardcore into their Northern California alt-metal.""

Frontman Chino Moreno’s poetic lyrics—described by a Time magazine critic as “fiercely intelligent”—are often evocative, yet are sparse enough to allow for multiple interpretations. Moreno has cited Morrissey, Weezer’s Rivers Cuomo, The Cure’s Robert Smith, and Depeche Mode’s David Gahan among his favorite singers, and beyond an occasional similarity in vocal technique, these singers’ sweeping sense of drama and delicate vulnerability is often evident in Moreno’s vocals.

Deftones members have worked on several side projects, including Moreno’s Team Sleep and drummer Abe Cunningam’s Phallucy. Guitarist Stephen Carpenter works with a group called Kush, featuring members of Fear Factory and Cypress Hill. Turntablist Frank Delgado has a DJ crew with DJ Crook of Team Sleep, DJ Julez, and Matt D called Decibel Devils.

* Chino Moreno (vocals, guitar)
* Stephen Carpenter (guitar)
* Abe Cunningham (drums)
* Chi Cheng (bass, backing vocals)
* Frank Delgado (turntablist/keyboardist/sampler)

(Incidentally, Carpenter is generally credited with “strings”, though if he actually plays anything other than electric guitar it’s not immediately apparent. This most likely refers to his abuse of the guitar strings, making screeching noises inbetween playing riffs.)

Early years: 1989-1993
When Carpenter was 15 years old he was hit by a car while skateboarding. This left him confined to a wheelchair for several months. It was at this point that he began teaching himself guitar by playing along with bands such as Anthrax, Stormtroopers of Death and Metallica. It has been reported that the driver paid Carpenter a cash settlement that allowed the band to purchase equipment, but drummer Abe Cunningham commented in an interview that this was ""a myth about how our band was started.""

Carpenter, Moreno and Cunningham went to the same high school. They were childhood friends and remained friends through the skateboarding scene in Sacramento. When Moreno found out Carpenter played guitar, he set up a jam session with Cunningham and the three began playing regularly in Carpenter's garage circa 1988. After playing with several bassists, the band settled on Justin Jaramillo and recorded a four track demo soon after. Within two years the band began playing club shows and later expanded their playing territory to San Francisco and Los Angeles where they played shows alongside bands such as Korn. While closing for another band in L.A., after the majority of the audience had left, the band impressed a Maverick Records representative. They were soon after signed to the label after showcasing three of their songs for Freddy DeMann and Guy Oseary.

The name ""Deftones"" was created by Carpenter who wanted to pick ""something that would just stand out but you know, not be all cheese-ball at the same time."" Carpenter combined the hip hop slang term ""def"", which was used by artists he listened to such as LL Cool J and Public Enemy, with the suffix ""-tones"", which was a popular suffix among 50s bands whose music he also enjoyed (e.g. Dick Dale and the Deltones; The Quin-Tones, The Monotones, The Cleftones and The Harptones). Carpenter said the name is intentionally vague to reflect the band's tendency to not focus on just one style of music.


Adrenaline: 1994-1996
The band's debut album, Adrenaline, was recorded at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington and released on October 3, 1995. It was produced by Deftones and Terry Date, who would go on to produce the band's next three albums. Initially unsuccessful, extensive touring, word-of-mouth and Internet promotion built the band a dedicated fanbase, as well as helping Adrenaline to sell over 220,000 copies without the singles ""7 Words"" and ""Bored"" (as well as their music videos) receiving any airplay. The band contributed the non-album track ""Teething"" to the soundtrack for the 1996 film The Crow: City of Angels and are also seen performing the song live during one of the film's scenes.

The album spent 21 weeks on the Billboard Heatseekers chart reaching a peak position of 23. When asked what he attributed the album's success to, Cheng responded, ""One word: perseverance. We've been together for almost eight years, on the road for two and we do it with honesty and integrity - and the kids can tell."" The album was RIAA certified gold on 7 July 1999 in recognition of 500,000 units sold.

Regarding the recording of the album, Abe Cunningham said, ""At the time we did the first record - which I really like and think is good - you can tell the band was really young. We'd been playing most of those songs for quite a while, and we were just so happy to be making a record that we didn't really think a whole lot about making the songs better."" Moreno felt that Adrenaline was recorded ""really fast""[ and performed all his vocals live with the band in the room using a hand-held Shure 58 microphone. A review of Adrenaline praised the album's musical control, precision, overall groove and Cunningham's ""surprisingly sophisticated drumming"". It was also noted that ""there is a bit of sameness in Chino Moreno's whispered vocal melodies, which drags the record down a bit.""
Adrenaline was certified platinum on September 23, 2008 by the RIAA


Around the Fur: 1997-1999
Deftones' second album, Around the Fur, was recorded at Studio Litho in Seattle, Washington and produced by Terry Date. Released on October 26, 1997, the album included a collaboration with singer Max Cavalera (of Sepultura/Soulfly/Cavalera Conspiracy) on ""Headup"", a tribute to Cavalera's late stepson Dana Wells, to whom the album was also dedicated. Although not yet a member of the band, Delgado is credited as ""audio"" on five of the album's tracks and Cunningham's wife, Annalynn, provides guest vocals on ""MX"".

""When we went in to make this record, we really didn't have a set idea of what we wanted to come out with,"" said Moreno in a 1998 interview with Chart magazine. However, he felt that the album ""fell into place"" once the band had settled into the studio. The band expanded its sound, spending more time with Terry Date, and giving more thought to the album's production. Cunningham varied his drum sound and experimented by using different types of snare drum on almost every track. The album was praised for its loud-soft dynamics, the flow of the tracks, Moreno's unusual vocals and the strong rhythm-section grooves created by Cheng and Cunningham. Stephen Thomas Erlewine's review noted that ""while they don't have catchy riffs or a fully developed sound, Around the Fur suggests they're about to come into their own.""

The album was highly anticipated and propelled the band to fame in the alternative metal scene on the strength of radio and MTV airplay for the singles ""My Own Summer (Shove It)"" and ""Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)"". Around the Fur sold 43,000 copies in its first week of release, and entered the Billboard 200 at number 29 (its peak position), remaining on the charts for 17 weeks. The band went back to touring, making appearances at the Warped Tour (in the United States, New Zealand and Australia), Pinkpop Festival, Roskilde Festival and Ozzfest as well as releasing a live EP on June 22, 1999. Around the Fur went on to reach RIAA gold status on June 24, 1999.


White Pony: 2000-2002
On June 20, 2000, the band released their third album, White Pony, again produced by Terry Date and Deftones. It was recorded at The Plant Studios in Sausalito, California and at Larrabee Sound Studios, West Hollywood, California. The album debuted at number three in the US Billboard chart with sales of 178,000 copies. Delgado (DJ Speedboat) was now a full-time band member, adding new elements to the band's music. The melancholy ""Teenager"", for example, was a radical departure in style and mood, a ""love song,"" according to Moreno, which incorporated elements of glitch and trip hop, with programming duties carried out by Moreno's friend and side-project Team Sleep bandmate DJ Crook. A collaboration with singer Maynard James Keenan of Tool is present on ""Passenger"", and the refrain in ""Knife Party"" features vocals by Rodleen Getsic. Moreno had also started contributing additional guitar on several tracks.

An interview with the band in Alternative Press explained the recording process of White Pony. After a break from touring, the band spent four months in the studio writing and recording White Pony, the longest amount of time they had dedicated to an album thus far. Moreno explained that the majority of this time was spent trying to write songs, and that the writing of ""Change (In the House of Flies)"" was the turning point where the band began working as a group. Despite being pressured to release the album sooner, the band decided to take their time making the album. Cheng explained that ""We didn’t feel like we had anything to lose, so we made the record we wanted to make."" Moreno did not have a common theme in mind lyrically, but made a conscious decision to bring an element of fantasy into his lyrics, explaining that ""I basically didn’t sing about myself on this record. I made up a lot of story lines and some dialogue, even. I took myself completely out of it and wrote about other things.""

Reviews were generally positive, noting Moreno's increasing sophistication as a lyricist and the group's experimentalism. Of White Pony, one reviewer wrote that ""Deftones went soft, but in an impressive way, to twist around its signature punk sound.""

The album was originally released as an 11 track version beginning with ""Feiticeira"" and ending with ""Pink Maggit"" and featuring gray cover art. A limited edition print of 50,000 black and red jewel case versions of White Pony were also released at the same time with a bonus 12th track entitled ""The Boy's Republic"". Later, the band released ""Back to School (Mini Maggit)"", a rap-influenced interpretation of the album's closer, ""Pink Maggit"". ""Back to School (Mini Maggit)"" was track 11 on the leaked pre-release version of White Pony in April 2000, but not included on the original (official) issue of the album in June 2000. The leaked version of White Pony also included the slower version of ""Pink Maggit"" which appeared on the first official White Pony CDs. That song was listed as a bonus track (track 12) on the leaked pre-release version.  The song was picked up as a single and placed as the new opening track (with ""Pink Maggit"" still the closer) of a re-released White Pony on October 3, 2000 featuring altered white cover art. Not entirely happy with re-releasing the album, the band negotiated to have ""Back to School"" made available as a free download for anyone who had already bought the original album. Chino noted that ""Everybody's already downloaded our record before it came out anyway, otherwise I'd be kind of feelin' like, 'Man, why [are] we putting [out] all these different versions of the record?' [...] that's the best way we can actually get this song out to the people who already purchased this record, for free basically. And if they wanna buy the record again, it's cool.""

White Pony achieved platinum status, selling over 1.3 million copies in the US, and earning the band a 2001 Grammy award for Best Metal Performance for the song ""Elite"".


Deftones: 2003-2005
Deftones began work on their fourth album under the working title Lovers. Regarding the album's direction, Cheng commented that ""We've proven that we can musically go in any direction we want, and we want to get kind of heavy on this one."" Moreno underwent vocal training as a precaution after severely damaging his vocal cords on the band's 2001 summer tour. The band converted their rehearsal space in Sacramento into a fully equipped studio and recorded most of the album there at negligible cost. The band brought in Terry Date to assist with production, and also received input on musical arrangement from Greg Wells on several of the album's tracks. The band later added more material at Studio X in Seattle, WA and at Larrabee Studios in West Hollywood, CA. Overall the album took twelve months and cost roughly $2.5 million to produce with the band being fined by Maverick for missing deadlines.

In January 2003, Deftones left the studio to perform some ""one off"" shows in Australia and New Zealand as part of the annual Big Day Out Festival. Shortly after, the band returned to the studio to finish their fourth album. The self-titled Deftones was released on May 20, 2003. Deftones entered the Billboard 200 at number two and sold 167,000 copies in its first week. The album remained in the Billboard top 100 for nine weeks, supported by the first single, ""Minerva"". The band shot a video for their second single, ""Hexagram"", with fans watching the band play the song in an indoor skatepark in Simi Valley, California. The band made a video for the track ""Bloody Cape"", but it was never released for play on television. The video was only made available on the band's official website for one day. It was later released on their B-Sides and Rarities DVD.

Reviews were mainly positive, praising the band for the heavy album's progression and originality in the midst of declining creativity in contemporary metal. Moreno was quoted as saying, ""It's all on record. We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren't going to be with them."" In reviewing Deftones, Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes that ""Hexagram"", the album's opener, ""hits hard — harder than they ever have, revealing how mushy Staind is, or how toothless Linkin Park is,"" but also goes on to say that the album ""sticks a little too close to familiar territory."" The Onion's A.V. Club similarly called the album ""less rewarding than its predecessor, though its peaks rival any in the genre.""

The band released a compilation album titled B-Sides & Rarities on October 4, 2005. The CD includes various b-sides and covers from throughout their career, while the DVD contains behind-the-scenes footage and the band's complete videography up to that point.


Saturday Night Wrist: 2006-2007
 Deftones performing live in Glasgow, June 2006.The band's latest album, titled Saturday Night Wrist, was released on October 31, 2006. It debuted at number ten in the US Billboard chart with sales of just over 76,000, a significant decrease on the first week sales of their two previous releases.

Rather than work with longtime producer Terry Date, Deftones decided to record with Bob Ezrin. Cunningham says that while the group enjoyed working with Date, ""At this point, we just needed to change things up [...] And this is definitely a different style. Working with him [Ezrin] is just putting us fucking upside down. He's cracking the whip.""[45] After recording all the instrumentals for the record, Chino Moreno decided to record his vocals separately. Chino thus finished recording the album with former Far guitarist Shaun Lopez as producer. Collaborations on the record include Annie Hardy from Giant Drag on the song ""Pink Cellphone"" and Serj Tankian from System of a Down on the track ""Mein"".

The album's first single was called ""Hole in the Earth"", hitting the radio on October 16, 2006. ""Hole in the Earth"" was also featured as a downloadable song for the PS3 & Xbox 360 versions of Guitar Hero 3. ""Mein"" was the album's second single, which aired in Spring of 2007.

As of March 2007, Saturday Night Wrist has sold over 250,000 copies (US).

Deftones spent the majority of 2006 and 2007 touring around the world in support of the album. The band played shows in places including North America, Canada, Europe, South America, Japan and Australia. The band also performed in such tours as Taste of Chaos, Family Values Tour and the Soundwave Festival in Australia.


Eros: 2008-2009
Deftones are currently in the studio writing and recording their next release, Eros, which will once again utilize the production services of Terry Date. Deftones have been writing the album since Fall 2007. As of December 7, 2007, six to eight songs were finished and the album is expected to be released in the winter of 2008. Chino Moreno has described the album as weird, unorthodox, featuring a lot of atmosphere and soundscaping, and having ""fuck you, I hope you die!"" style aggression. He has also stated that he won't be contributing on guitar, instead focusing on his vocals, and will leave guitar duties entirely to Stephen Carpenter. Carpenter will be utilizing his signature 8-String guitar, the ESP Stef B-8. They started recording the album on April 14th, 2008.

Moreno stated that this album would be more up-tempo (as far as the drumming is concerned), going on to say that the past couple of albums have been more mid-tempo; that Abe Cunningham has been playing faster. He also referred to the album as being ""snappy"". Moreno stated in an interview that the process for this album would be more raw and simplified after dissatisfaction with the long and ""pieced-together"" experience of recording Saturday Night Wrist.

On January 14th, Chino Moreno posted an instrumental electronic beat that sounds similar to Team Sleep called ""You've Seen The Butcher"", on the Deftones' MySpace page, and announced in a bulletin that the album would be called Eros, the Greek word for ""love."" It was also announced that Eros would be released by Reprise Records, the first time Deftones have released an album not affiliated with Maverick Records.

On September 18, Deftones played a secret show at the Spaceland Club in Los Angeles. The band played a new song entitled Melanie, which they also played at the previously announced headlining show at the Ventura Theater in Ventura, California on September 19 and also at the KUPD's End of Summer Scorcher on September 20 in Peoria, Arizona, where they co-headlined with Alice In Chains.

Also, recently Deftones have been posting a number of videos on MySpace and their blog, documenting the recording process of Eros.

On November 4, bassist Chi Cheng was seriously injured in a car accident in Santa Clara, California. Chino Moreno posted on the band's blog, saying, ""It deeply saddens me to inform you all that our brother Chi Cheng was involved in a terrible car accident last night. He is currently in a Northern California hospital in serious, but stable condition. I am on my way up north right now to be by his side, along with the rest of our bandmates and family. Chi is one of the strongest people I know, and I'm praying that his strength will get him through this. Please say a prayer for him as well.""[47] Following the accident, Cheng's bandmates and mother, Jeanne, began using the Deftones blog to post updates on Cheng's condition. In a post dated November 18, it was stated that ""Chi's condition remains the same - serious, but stable. He still lies in a coma, however his vitals (heart, lungs, and blood pressure) all exhibit very stable functions and doctors have begun removing much of the excess monitoring equipment."" In a blog posted dated November 9, it was reported that Chi was attended by three off-duty EMTs who happened upon the accident scene. The post goes on to state that ""If not for them, the chances of Chi making to the hospital alive would have been poor."" On December 9, it was announced that Chi had been moved into the care of an unnamed hospital that ""specializes in the care and management of traumatic and non-trauma related brain injuries"".

Diamond Eyes: 2010-2011
It was announced that the new album would be titled ""Diamond Eyes"", to be released May 18th, 2010. The first single from the album, ""Rocket Skates"", was released February 23rd; the second single is ""Diamond Eyes"". And The First Video Release Was ""Diamond Eyes"", ""Rocket Skates"", ""Sextape"", Finally ""You've Seen the Butcher"". All together Diamond Eyes Has sold 62,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release to debut at position No. 6 on The Billboard 200 chart. 


 Koi No Yokan: 2012
On March 29, 2012 an interview with Stephen Carpenter was posted on ESP Guitars's YouTube channel. In it, Carpenter talks about his switch to 7-string and 8-string guitars. At the end, he says, ""Musically, me and my band, Deftones, are working on a new record and we hope to have it finished and out by Summer of 2012, and when the new record's done we'll start another touring cycle and get out there and play our stuff for those who are interested.""
Chino Moreno has also stated that it has resemblance to their 2000 record, White Pony, when it's compared to their previous work. “The songs are very different from each other, not heavier or slower, but more dynamic, going towards several directions, it’s heavy, but beautiful.” In addition, it has been reported that Nick Raskulinecz will return to produce their seventh effort, which is, as of yet, unnamed.
On April 3, 2012 after performing at the Quilmes Rock 2012 festival, Chino was interviewed about Crosses and the new Deftones record. He said that the writing process was completed last week and they start recording after he gets back from South America. ""We start recording next week. I love it, I'm so excited about it because Deftones, obviously, that's my life, I've made a career since I was fifteen years old and right before I came last week we finished all the writing so, next week, when I get back, we start recording. We should have a record that comes out in the early Fall, maybe October. Maybe September."" 

The album was released through Reprise Records on November 12, 2012, in the UK and November 13, 2012, in the United States. Band frontman Chino Moreno characterized the album as ""dynamic"" with a full range of sound, noting that more contributions were made to the album from bassist Sergio Vega compared to their previous record, Diamond Eyes. On September 19, 2012, the band released the song ""Leathers"" as a promotional single via a free download on their website. On October 8, 2012, ""Leathers"" was released as the album's first single.

""Tempest"" was released as a single on October 9, 2012.

 Gore: 2016
Gore is the eighth studio album by American alternative metal band Deftones, released on April 8, 2016 by Reprise Records. Its release was met with critical acclaim, debuting at number two on the US Billboard 200, it is the band's fifth album to debut within the chart's top-ten and is their highest-charting since their 2003 eponymous album.The album was noted for its creative tension between frontman Chino Moreno and lead guitarist Stephen Carpenter, which was described by Rolling Stone as Moreno ""playing Morrissey to the guitarist's Meshuggah""

 Ohms: 2020
is the ninth studio album by American alternative metal band Deftones, released on September 25, 2020, through Reprise Records. Musically, Ohms has been described as an alternative metal and dream pop album. It is the first Deftones album since their eponymous 2003 album to be produced by Terry Date, although the last time the band had worked with him was during the sessions of the unreleased album Eros in 2008. It is also their first album on which Stephen Carpenter utilizes a nine-string guitar

 White Pony x Black Stallion: 2020
If we go by the wisdom that album anniversary celebrations tend to be the last refuge of the dying creative force, then there was never any reason for Deftones to mark the 20th birthday of ‘White Pony’ this year. In September, the titanic ‘Ohms’ extended to ten years and four albums one of the most remarkable runs of any band this century; a brooding modern masterpiece, it confirmed that they remain close to the peak of their powers as they enter into the fifth different decade of a career that began in 1988. Still, many of their fans continue to contend that ‘White Pony’ is their finest moment, and as a nod to that, the group have finally realised what presumably seemed like a good idea when they first had it; a remix album, originally inspired back in 2000 by frontman Chino Moreno’s love of DJ Shadow’s ‘Endtroducing…’ Shadow himself is one of eleven artists to step up to the plate on ‘Black Stallion’, chipping in with a irritatingly glitchy take on ‘Digital Bath’. The bulk of the record is similarly throwaway; Clams Casino strips down ‘Feiticeira’ so far past its bare bones as to be beyond recognition, Salva’s choppy reimagining of ‘RX Queen’ fails to properly translate the urgency of the original, and Purity Ring’s spacey ‘Knife Prty’ falls awkwardly halfway between cover and remix.
The low point is a new version of ‘Passenger’ from Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda, a baffling choice to begin with given how unfairly ‘White Pony’ was so often lumped in with the nu metal of the time. In fact, though, ‘Passenger’ does not nod to ‘Hybrid Theory’ or even 'Meteora', but instead to Shinoda’s more recent work, meaning no guitar, a boring synth loop and horrible, pseudo-AutoTuned vocals. There are occasional flickers of inspiration - see the maximalist rework of ‘Elite’ from Blanck Mass and the minimalist ‘Teenager’ that Robert Smith contributed - but otherwise, you have to hope that everybody involved enjoyed putting Black Stallion together, because it ain’t much fun to listen to. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Deftones"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Upon discovering Britney Spears at the age of ten, and eventually Avril Lavigne and Evanescence in high school, Jacklin decided to shift her focus from a future social work to a career in music. As her tastes changed, so did her songwriting style, and by her twenties she was drawing from a much deeper well of artistic expression, citing artists like Fiona Apple, Anna Calvi, and Appalachian folk trio Mountain Man as inspirations.

By day, Jacklin was working in a factory that made essentials oils, and by evening, she was honing her skills on-stage and in the studio. A pair of singles, ""Pool Party"" and ""Coming of Age"", drew praise both in Australia and in the U.K., and in 2016 she released her debut full-length, Don't Let the Kids Win, via London-based indie label Transgressive in the U.K. and Polyvinyl in the U.S.

Though his name is sometimes assumed to be a pseudonym due to its similarity to German composer Kurt Weill, it is in fact his birth name, as given by his parents Donna and Charles Vile.

Vile began his musical career in 2003 creating lo-fi home recordings with frequent collaborator Adam Granduciel. The duo subsequently formed the indie rock band The War on Drugs in 2005. Vile departed following the release of their debut studio album, Wagonwheel Blues, in 2008.

Vile's music has been likened to Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, and Tom Petty. His first album for Matador, titled Childish Prodigy was released in October 2009. Prior to signing with Matador, Vile released two albums, God Is Saying This To You and Constant Hitmaker, on Mexican Summer and Woodsist, respectively.

213,213,tycho,1031208,37633181,"
Scott Hansen (born February 7, 1977), professionally known as Tycho, is an American ambient music artist and producer, who is known as ISO50 for his photographic and design works. Tycho is currently signed to, and has released under, Ghostly International, but has also released music on Merck Records and Gammaphone Records. His song, Dictaphone's Lament, was used as the track on a music video entitled ""Live Life to the Fullest"", which was made by and featured on the action cartoon block Toonami. Additionally, his song Cascade (originally made for an Adult Swim/Ghostly International compilation) was played during the final moments of the original 11-year run of Toonami in 2008.

Hansen began releasing music over 10 years ago with The Science of Patterns EP. His first full-length, Sunrise Projector, came out in 2004, and as the critical acclaim continued in 2006 with the release of Past Is Prologue.

It was around 2008 that URBmagazine noted Tycho as one of the Next 100 artists to watch, and Hansen continued to release singles and experiment with more live instrumentation. In 2011, his meticulous process saw the release of Dive, his debut full-length for Ghostly International. Tranquil, nostalgic and melodic, the record established him beyond the realm of IDM and ambient.

Now with Awake, Tycho's second Ghostly LP, the project returns as a true three-piece band comprised of Zac Brown (guitar, bass) and Rory O’Connor (live drums). Lengthy touring for Dive brought Tycho to its full potential, and in efforts to capture the energy on the road Hansen invited Brown and O’Connor in to the creative process. Both the sound and artwork of Awake capture Hansens stylistic shift, conjuring a more kintetic and percussive sensory experience. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tycho"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

216,216,fleet foxes,2286301,103274811,"Fleet Foxes is an American indie folk band formed in Seattle, Washington in 2006. The band consists of Robin Pecknold (vocals, guitar), Skyler Skjelset (guitar, mandolin, backing vocals), Casey Wescott (keyboards, mandolin, backing vocals), Christian Wargo (bass, guitar, backing vocals) and Morgan Henderson (upright bass, guitar, woodwinds, violin, percussion, saxophone).

Led by singer-songwriter Robin Pecknold, the band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP Sun Giant and their debut album Fleet Foxes on Sub Pop. Both received critical praise and reviewers often noted the band's use of refined lyrics and vocal harmonies. Fleet Foxes' second studio album Helplessness Blues was released on Sub Pop in 2011. Following a hiatus between 2013 and 2016, during which Pecknold pursued an undergraduate degree, Fleet Foxes reunited to record their third album, Crack-Up, released on Nonesuch Records in 2017. The band's fourth album, Shore, was released on Anti- in September 2020.

Formation and early years (2005–06)
Robin Pecknold and Skyler Skjelset both attended Lake Washington High School in Kirkland, a suburb of Seattle, and soon became close friends. Pecknold and Skjelset bonded over an appreciation of Bob Dylan and Neil Young and began making music together. Their parents influenced their musical tastes early on—Skjelset's mother Peggi was a keen listener to both Dylan and Hank Williams while Pecknold's father Greg was a member of The Fathoms, a local 1960s soul group. The two shared an interest in the music of Dylan and Brian Wilson. Pecknold played bass for Seattle's Dolour on a US tour in 2005, shortly before forming the first incarnation of Fleet Foxes.

Originally going by the name ""The Pineapples"", a name clash with another local band prompted a change and Pecknold decided upon ""Fleet Foxes"", suggesting that it was ""evocative of some weird English activity like fox hunting"". Pecknold took up the role of principal songwriter, both singing and playing guitar, while Skjelset played lead guitar. The original lineup was filled out by Casey Wescott on keyboards and backing vocals, Bryn Lumsden on bass and Nicholas Peterson on drums and backing vocals.

Pecknold's late-sixties pop style caught the attention of the Seattle producer Phil Ek and he helped them record their first demo in 2006, the self-released Fleet Foxes EP. Ek was impressed with the band's songwriting, and on hearing Pecknold for the first time, noted, ""It was obvious he had talent coming out of his ass."" By late 2006 the Seattle press began to take notice of the band; Tom Scanlon of the Seattle Times stated that he was impressed with the band's lyrics and musical maturity. By the end of the year, Lumsden had been replaced on bass by Craig Curran, who would also handle many of the band's vocal harmonies.

With growing popularity on the local circuit, the band set about making their first album in early 2007, spending time in the studio with producer Ek in addition to recording material at home. However, funds for recording were tight, so the band members cobbled together what funds they had, which limited the time they had in the studio, and so the majority of the tracks were recorded in various band members' apartments, other spaces, or the basement of Pecknold's parents' house.

Sun Giant and Fleet Foxes (2007–08)
Fleet Foxes were becoming increasingly popular and by late 2007, they had attracted over a quarter of a million song plays over two months on their Myspace site. Although the band had not released any of their recordings, they benefited from word of mouth exposure and their success soon translated into a record deal, signing with Warner Music subsidiary record label Sub Pop on January 18, 2008. According to Sub Pop's A&R, Sue Busch, at the time of signing the band was still a relatively primitive set-up, being without manager or legal representation. Robin's sister Aja Pecknold then assumed the role of band manager. The band's frontman, Robin Pecknold, attributes much of their success and popularity to illegal file sharing.

The band tracked their second EP, Sun Giant, at Bear Creek Studio and performed overdubs and mixed at Seattle's Avast! Recording Co., around the same time in preparation for upcoming tours. Fleet Foxes began their spring tour with another Northwest band Blitzen Trapper on February 28, 2008. Before the recording of the EP, bassist Curran was replaced by Christian Wargo, whose voice, like that of his predecessor, would become an important part of the band's harmony blend. The band's performances, first at the SXSW festival in March 2008, and then the Sasquatch! festival in May 2008, moved the band into the public consciousness, notably attracting attention from the European press for the first time.

Sun Giant was released internationally on April 8, 2008 and the group's brand of folk, rock and pop, marked by their use of vocal harmonies, was well received by the press. Despite the warm critical reception, the group said that the EP did not represent their full ambitions, serving merely as a CD to sell while on tour. In May 2008, the band chose to extend their North American and European tour until September in support of their forthcoming album. At this time Josh Tillman replaced Peterson on drums and backing vocals. Their first full-length album, Fleet Foxes, was released shortly afterwards on June 3, 2008. The album achieved similar critical success as the previous EP. Fleet Foxes received four out of five stars from Rolling Stone, which compared it to the likes of the Beach Boys, Animal Collective, and Crosby, Stills & Nash, and a 9.0 out of 10 in a review by Pitchfork Media, sharing the website's album of the year rank with the Sun Giant EP. The Guardian was particularly complimentary, awarding the album five stars and declaring it ""a landmark in American music — an instant classic"". On June 24, 2008, Fleet Foxes went to No. 1 on the CMJ Radio 200 Chart. The album achieved an average rating of 87/100 from 30 critic reviews on the aggregator website Metacritic.

While the group enjoyed moderate success in the United States, Fleet Foxes was better received in Europe, selling over 200,000 copies in the five months following its release. The sales were matched with critical plaudits and their debut album won Uncut's first ever Music Award 2008 prize. Uncut's editor, Allan Jones, said the album ""showed impeccable musicianship, and although you could trace its antecedents, it sounded totally unique. Fleet Foxes was just a glorious debut."" The band sold out music venues for their tours of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, reaffirming their growing popularity.

At the end of 2008, Fleet Foxes was rated album of the year by Billboard's Critic's Choice and in Metacritic's end of year best album round-up it appeared in 17 lists, topping six of them. Furthermore, it had sold over 408,000 copies in North America and over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom, making it the first gold certificate record for UK label Bella Union. Their growing profile enabled the band to make televised appearances, playing on Vincent Moon's La Blogotheque in December 2008 and on Saturday Night Live the following January. In 2009, they toured in Europe to favorable reviews; the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said their show in Paradiso induced goosebumps. In 2008 and 2009, the band played globally ending the tour in September with a final European leg.

Helplessness Blues (2009–12)
Pecknold said that he would have liked the album to be released in 2009; however, the band's touring schedule delayed rehearsals of the new songs until February 2009. These sessions took place in a rented house outside Seattle, but were mostly scrapped, losing the band $60,000 of their own money. Further delays ensued because the drummer, Tillman, was scheduled to play a solo tour in Europe and North America throughout the 2009–10 winter. Pecknold later sent some demos to producer Phil Ek and expressed the hope that the second LP would emerge in late 2010.

In December 2009, Pecknold said he wanted the new LP to sound ""less poppy, less upbeat and more groove-based"". He referenced the 12-string guitar sound from Roy Harper's folk album Stormcock, saying, ""That will be the primary sonic distancing from the last record."" He wanted the band to record very quickly, with ""vocal takes in one go, so even if there are fuck-ups, I want them to be on there. I want there to be guitar mistakes. I want there to be not totally flawless vocals. I want to record it and have that kind of cohesive sound. Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, to me, is the best-sounding album because it sounds like there were only six hours in the universe for that album to be recorded in. So I want it to have that feeling."" The band eventually began recording in April 2010 in various locations (including West Hurley, New York) under the label Reciprocal Recording and decided to scrap the earlier idea of a fast recording (though according to the band many of the initial vocals were done in one take). The album features a new six-piece band line up, with the addition of the former Blood Brothers bassist Morgan Henderson on upright bass and woodwind instruments.

The album, Helplessness Blues, was released on May 3, 2011 with a cover illustrated by the Seattle artist Toby Liebowitz and painted by Christopher Alderson. The title track was released via free download on January 31, 2011, and the album's fourth track, ""Battery Kinzie"", was premiered in the UK on Zane Lowe's radio show on March 22, 2011. The Sub Pop record label released a downloadable music video of the track ""Grown Ocean"", with footage of the album's recording, on its website in support of the album. A 12"" vinyl double A-side single of ""Helplessness Blues"" and ""Grown Ocean"" was released for Record Store Day on April 16, 2011. On November 1, 2011, Pecknold's brother, Sean Pecknold, released the official music video for ""The Shrine / An Argument"".

Helplessness Blues was nominated as Best Folk Album at the 2012 Grammy Awards, held February 12, 2012.

Departure of Tillman and hiatus (2012–2016)
On January 18, 2012, after the band had finished touring for the album, drummer Tillman announced that he had left the band. He would go on to reinvent himself and record several albums as Father John Misty, notable for his ironic sense of humor in lyrics and media as well as often criticizing both the record industry and society in interviews and on stage.

In October 2020, Pecknold reflected on Tillman's departure during a Reddit AMA: ""[Josh] ""quit"" the band after recording drums for Helplessness, got into narcotics and made his first Father John Misty album while I was making Helplessness in Seattle. Then Sub Pop offered to put out his album, but only if he delayed it for a year or so and toured Helplessness with us. Which we all weakly agreed to going through with, but it quickly became obvious he'd rather have just been doing that project instead, and I would have rathered that as well. So that tour I had to endure being around a lot of substance abuse, sabotaged shows, just general ill treatment, shit-talking, all while paying him for songs he didn't have anything to do with. It sucked!""

On June 15, 2013, an image of a home recording set-up–including a laptop computer, microphone and guitar–was posted on the Fleet Foxes Facebook page with the caption ""Step one"". On June 16, 2013, an image of a broken mandolin with the caption ""Step two"" was posted. These images were later deleted, but led to speculation that the group was working on a new project, possibly a third studio album. On April 23, 2014, Robin Pecknold posted to the band's Facebook page that he had moved to New York to get his undergraduate degree at the Columbia University School of General Studies, a liberal arts college of Columbia University in New York City.

Crack-Up (2016–2018)
On May 18, 2016, while answering fan questions on his Instagram account, Pecknold confirmed that Fleet Foxes were working on new material with drummer and frequent collaborator Neal Morgan, best known for his work with Joanna Newsom and Bill Callahan. Describing Morgan as a ""full Fox"", Pecknold also admitted he ""had to up my songwriting game for homeboy."" However, when Pecknold posted a photo of the band minus Morgan on Instagram, he clarified that Morgan was one of three drummers involved in the new album, and that for the time being Fleet Foxes would consist of Pecknold, Skjelset, Wescott, Wargo, and Henderson as a ""five-piece 'core band'"", but they would still use a drummer for live performances and additional musicians for certain shows. Pecknold also said that the new material would be ""a different vibe"" compared to Fleet Foxes' previous output. On November 14, 2016, the band confirmed (via their Facebook account) that their new album was nearly complete.

On December 25, 2016, Pecknold posted a photo on his Instagram account which showed four albums in the Fleet Foxes' queue in his iTunes library: the first studio album Fleet Foxes; the Sun Giant EP; the second studio album Helplessness Blues; and an unknown third album entitled Ylajali. This led to speculation that the band's third album would: 1) be named after a character from Knut Hamsun's novel Hunger; 2) contain a photo from Japanese photographer Hiroshi Hamaya as the cover art; and 3) be released through Nonesuch Records, since the label's logo can be seen on the album cover.

In an email newsletter on January 1, 2017, production company Mason Jar Music confirmed that Fleet Foxes was working on a new album, since they contributed to the production. The album was called Crack-Up, after an F. Scott Fitzgerald essay of the same name. The album is a concept album and was recorded at Electric Lady Studios and Sear Sound in New York City.

On March 7, 2017, Fleet Foxes announced their third studio album, Crack-Up, released on June 16, 2017 via Nonesuch Records, a new label for the band. The lead single, ""Third of May / Ōdaigahara"", was released the same day. On April 4, 2017, the band posted the album trailer for the new album on YouTube. The trailer briefly presents various songs from the album and shows some images while they were recording them. The video was made by Sean Pecknold, Robin's brother.

On May 15, 2017, Fleet Foxes made their live return at the Wilma Theatre in Missoula, in which they performed nine songs from Crack-Up along with a selection of older material and a cover of ""In the Morning"" by Bee Gees. The band's current live line-up includes Matt Barrick of The Walkmen, who is also the most heavily featured of the three guest drummers who contributed to Crack-Up. Barrick has continued to play with the band, but has not become an official member. The new album also included the sounds of a brass quartet called The Westerlies.

On October 10, 2017, the band announced the release of a new EP, entitled The Electric Lady Session, for Black Friday Record Store Day 2017. The EP was released on November 24 of that year, and is a collection of live performances of four songs from Crack-Up, originally recorded for their session at Fordham University’s radio station WFUV. For Record Store Day 2018, the band released another EP, entitled ""Crack Up (Choral Version)""/""In The Morning (Live in Switzerland)"", in collaboration with the Icelandic female choir, Graduale Nobili.

Shore (2019–present)
On December 31, 2018, Pecknold teased several new demos online for an upcoming new album.

If his first projects embraced indie electro influences, he then explored soul and indie pop on his first album Hundred Fifty Roses, produced in collaboration with Crayon. This album is a turning point in Duñe's career, as he not only co-produced all the tracks, but is also the main vocalist on the whole album.

Following this release, Duñe wished to evolve towards an even more personal sound highlighting his vocals, and leaving room for his hip hop and r&b influences which were existing in a more subtle way until then. Thus, he collaborated with several artists such as Swing & Angèle, Ehla or Ichon with whom he built a strong musical universe by working on productions as well as toplines.

224,224,dewolff,78330,1512069,"DeWolff are a psychedelic rock band from The Netherlands’ deep south, formed in 2007 by brothers Pablo and Luka van de Poel and Robin Piso. 

When their psychedelic yet hard rocking, self-titled EP was released in 2008 it immediately conquered the hearts of rock music lovers all across the country and in December 2008 the band played their first show at Paradiso, a legendary venue in Amsterdam. The release of their 2009 debut album “Strange Fruits and Undiscovered Plants” was followed by a successful tour through the Netherlands and Germany. In 2010, then still aged 15, 18 and 19, DeWolff played in front of an audience of 10,000 at Europe’s oldest music festival Pinkpop.

In late 2010 DeWolff recorded their second album “Orchards/Lupine”. This record was released in January 2011 and immediately made it to #11 in the Dutch album charts, a huge accomplishment for a young alternative rock band in nowadays’ musical climate. The tour that followed the release of “Orchards/Lupine” completely sold out and in August 2011 DeWolff played in front of an audience of 15,000 at the Hungarian Sziget festival and in front of 30,000 people at the Dutch Lowlands festival.

A film crew had followed the band from the release of their debut album until the Sziget performance and in May 2012 the resulting documentary “DeWolff” was premiered at the Amsterdam International Documentary Festival. One month later DeWolff’s third studio album, entitled “DeWolff IV”, was released. As well as some electrocuted, hard rocking tunes, this album also featured a twenty-minute rock opera. DeWolff’s live reputation grew bigger and bigger and their highly energetic concerts, which by now had lead them to France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Russia and even Australia, proved DeWolff to be one of the best and wildest live bands in their league. 

In search of the sexy Southern swagger to be heard on those old Southern Rock and soul records that by now had become a great influence on DeWolff’s new material, the band travelled to Valdosta, Georgia in early 2014 to record their next album with Grammy award-winning producer Mark Neill. The resulting album GRAND SOUTHERN ELECTRIC sounds like a classic: this album shows a perfect blend of great songwriting and next level riffery on a foundation of some of the grooviest drum grooves known to man and topped by a great vocal performance reminiscent of Leon Russell in his early days.

After the three founding members originally met in high school, a bassist and a drummer were found, and they all moved to a house in Silver Lake in 2008 to record their album. Their debut album as Local Natives, ""Gorilla Manor"", was released in the UK on November 2nd, 2009, and saw a US release date of February 16th, 2010. The band's sound has been described as ""afropop-influenced guitars with hyperactive drumming and hooky three-part harmonies"". They started to attract the attention of the music press after playing nine shows at the 2009 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Initial reviews of Local Natives have drawn favourable comparisons to Arcade Fire, Fleet Foxes and Vampire Weekend.

Utilizing lots of vocal harmonies and drifting, dreamlike melodies, Local Natives have an intricate sound based around the delicate interconnectedness of all of their parts. This gives the band a sound that is able to be orchestral while still feeling understated, evoking the carefully assembled pop of Grizzly Bear. Their debut, Gorilla Manor, arrived in 2009 through U.K. label Infectious Records (with a domestic release coming by way of Frenchkiss in 2010). In 2011, Andy Hamm left Local Natives, leaving them to continue on as a quartet. In 2013, the band returned with its sophomore album, Hummingbird, featuring the single ""Breakers"".

238,238,loyle carner,433581,16206841,"Loyle Carner is an emcee from South London has been causing quite a stir following the release of his debut EP 'A Little Late’  in September of 2014. All but one track on the EP was produced by Loyle’s right hand man and live partner Rebel Kleff. The two of them create reminiscent old school hip hop with their own UK and modern influences. 

After first appearing in 2013 on Rejjie Snow’s ‘Rejovich’ EP on track ‘1992’, Loyle’s name started to make the rounds, not least to mention the track being picked up by Majestic Casual and has racked up over 700k views to date. Following the release of the ‘A Little Late’ EP, Loyle has gone on to work with the likes of Kae Tempest, Maverick Sabre, Tom Misch and multiple others, all in preparation for releases in 2015. 

With two successful UK tours now under his belt with Joey Bada$$ and Atmosphere, Loyle is set to make some serious moves on the UK circuit and abroad, with strong support coming from all over Europe, the US and Australia. Support in the UK has come from all areas, being championed on Radio 1Xtra by DJ Semtex and Phil Taggart, Huw Stephens and Lauren Laverne at Radio 1. His latest single with Kate Tempest was added to 6Music’s B-list and then bumped up to the A-List immediately after a week and has not stopped being played.

Carner released his third studio album, 'hugo', in October, 2022.

In 'hugo', there’s a central question that Loyle Carner keeps coming back to: “I’m young, Black, successful and have a platform - but where do I go next?” The answer is explored in this epic scream of a third album. With urgent delivery and gloriously widescreen production, Carner confronts both the deeply personal (“You can’t hate the roots of a tree, and not hate the tree. So how can I hate my father without hating me?) and the highly political (“I told the black man he didn’t understand I reached the white man he wouldn’t take my hand”). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Loyle+Carner"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

239,239,caloncho,125921,2089312,"Óscar Alfonso Castro (born December 20, 1986 in Obregón, Sonora), better known as Caloncho, is a Mexican musician and singer.

As a child, Caloncho lived in Guadalajara where his favorite activity was playing the drums, until he later decided to experiment with melody. At the same time, he started playing the guitar that his grandfather had left for him years before, and soon learned to play songs from artists such as Bob Marley and Sublime.

Based on his own confession, Caloncho was the name his grandfather and step-sister, Angélica, used to call him when he was very little and since the name never annoyed him, he decided to use it as his musical stage name.

His first EP ""Homeotermo"" was recorded in 2011, and soon after, he started working with músician Siddhartha (a former-teacher and friend). He asked him to be his producer and Siddhartha agreed, saying about him: ""Caloncho is a newly born musician, he is being newly discovered, both by himself and by those around him. He sent me a sample of his music and I immediately felt it was a musical obligation to help extract the sweet juice from his fruitful melodies."" (Caloncho's website).

Caloncho then released his second EP, titled ""Fruta"" (Fruit), in September 2013. This production mixes his unique musical style with rhythms and stories of Mexican national folk, beaches, and forest rhythms, as well as urban sounds. All these sounds are used to retell different situations from his own life.

""We experimented a lot during the creation of the EP. We used organic sounds and objects that are not considered musical instruments, such as water, fruit, seeds, lighters, etc. I love it and I want to hear it"", he said.

Calancho has admitted that thanks to music, he has been able to live his life through all his senses. Music has also allowed him to feel completely connected with his family. ""My dad would write and play songs for us, and he would invite us to build on them, as a way to be in communion with each other,"" he's said.

In 2015 he published the LP, ""Fruta Vol. II"" (Fruit Vol. II), a production worked with certain arrangements.

He was nominated for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.

242,242,molchat doma,859002,25758240,"Молчат Дома (English translation: The Houses Are Silent)  is a Belarusian post-punk band with lyrics sung in Russian. Currently a trio with Egor Shkutko on vocal duties, Roman Komogortsev on guitar, synths, and drum machine, and Pavel Kozlov on bass and synths. The trio have been dubbed “the Belarusian New Order of our generation”, but that’s not quite right – they have far more in common with the gloomy nihilism of that band’s forebearer, Joy Division, a bleak, claustrophobic quality that’s like sinking into a pool of tar. Formed in 2017, in their hometown of Minsk, the trio take inspiration from early 80s post-punk and new wave, a visceral, intense mix of metallic drums, ominous synths, and melancholic bass lines. Some tracks sound like they were conceived using basic Casio keyboard presets; others borrow from Krautrock’s motoric grooves. But all burn with a deep seated despair and frustration, Yegor Shkutko’s vocals sounding anguished and distant. The sparse, cold production of second album Etazhi also sounds oddly futuristic, the crushing soundtrack to some dank, cyberpunk dystopia.Their second LP, Этажи (pronounced Etazhi, meaning “Floors”) was released in 2018 on Berlin-based Detriti Records. It has sold out four times and is currently on its fifth repressing due to outstanding demand. Этажи has garnered over one million views on Youtube. Despite playing to packed clubs in Warsaw, Helsinki and Berlin, they are still flying under the radar in their native Belarus. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Molchat+Doma"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

257,257,henry jamison,207032,1743239,"Vermont singer/songwriter Henry Jamison comes from an ancestry of writers and composers, making him a natural fit for the brand of thoughtful, literate indie folk he creates. Throughout the latter half of the 2010s, the New Englander delivered a succession of well-received singles and independent albums like 2017's The Wilds and 2019's Gloria Duplex. Taking a more collaborative approach, he began working with artists like Darlingside on 2020's ""I Forget Myself"" and Maisie Peters on 2022's ""Make It Out.""

Growing up in Burlington, Jamison was surrounded by music from a young age. His father is a classical composer and one of his ancestors is the popular Civil War era songwriter George Frederick Root. After stints in college, folk choirs, and various bands, Jamison set about demoing a handful of solo songs on an old Korg 8-track recording his father gave to him. After a bit of polish, those demos became his debut EP, 2016's The Rains, a warm set that melded folk guitar, lyrical introspection, and understated electronic flourishes. Jamison returned in early 2017 with a pair of singles, offering a new original tune, ""The Jacket,"" as well as his modern take on Gordon Lightfoot's ""If You Could Read My Mind."" In October of that year, he delivered his first full-length release, The Wilds, which was followed in early 2018 by The Wilds Quartets, an EP of three songs from that album arranged with a string quartet. Throughout the early part of 2019, Jamison issued a string of thoughtful singles like ""Gloria"" ""Boys,"" both of which appeared on his sophomore album Gloria Duplex, later that year.

Heading into the next decade, Jamison called on an array of collaborators from the folk and indie rock world to help with his next project. The result was 2020's Tourism, a five-song EP that featured contributions from artists like Darlingside, Joseph, and Fenne Lily. The collaborations continued, first with 2021's ""To Ash"" featuring Nico Muhly, and 2022's ""Make It Out"" with Maisie Peters. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Henry+Jamison"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

258,258,peach pit,875549,34947682,"There are at least 2 bands sharing the name Peach Pit.

1) Peach Pit are a pop band from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The band is led by singer and rhythm guitarist Neil Smith, lead guitarist Christopher Vanderkooy, bassist Peter Wilton, and drummer Mikey Pascuzzi. They describe their own music as ""chewed bubblegum pop"", whereas critics have described their sound as ""sad pop and surf rock"" and has a soft spoken vocal style with guitar driven rock melodies. The band's music videos are produced by videographer Lester Lyons-Hookham. The band have sported the same clothes for every live performance since buying them for their first music video shoot.

The group formed when high school friends, Neil Smith and Chris Vanderkooy, decided to collaborate on a musical project in 2014. Peter Wilton and Mikey Pascuzzi joined them on bass and drums. In June 2016, the band released its debut EP, Sweet FA, produced and recorded by Smith's former roommate Harley Small at The Space Studios in Vancouver BC. They quickly began work on their follow up release and debut LP, Being So Normal. The album was again recorded by Harley Small at The Space Studios  and was released in September 2017 on the Vancouver indie label Kingfisher Bluez.

Vocalist/rhythm guitarist Neil Smith was formerly part of the folk band Dogwood and Dahlia. Smith and bassist Peter Wilton formerly worked as Amazon delivery drivers, guitarist Christopher Vanderkooy worked at a local Vancouver brewery, and drummer Mikey Pascuzzi worked as a carpenter. The band quit their jobs to go on their first tour of North America, Europe and Asia from 2017-2018. They have been touring steadily ever since the release of their debut album.

Peach Pit performed at Bonnaroo, Shaky Knees Music Festival, CBC Music Festival, and Capital Hill Block Party in 2019 and opened for Two Door Cinema Club in a tour of the U.S. and Canada in 2019. The band has mentioned in interviews and during shows that they have recorded a new album.

2) Peach Pit is a 4-piece math/post rock band from Croatia formed in 1994.

The idea of making a band was started by Bruno Vidović and Mihael Bele in 1994, and after few parties, name Peach Pit (after an odd restaurant in the 90210) emerged as a name for a band that would create noise rock on the heritage of Big Black, Killdozer, Scratch acid and others. Peach Pit's first lineup was formed in the autumn of 1994 and it consisted of Mihael Bele on guitar, Bruno Vidović on drums and Branko Beðtak on bass.

First concerts which promoted early materials that featured vocals were loud and genuinely violent and often featured stage acts such as firecrackers, feedback and stage diving, for which they were often discarded as juvenile and abrupted by sound engineers by pulling out of electricity or even police.

By 1996, Peach Pit turned completely instrumental under influence of new music from across the water, and also played a lot of shows, some of them with noted names such as Zeni Geva. In the spring of 1997, Franjo Gluðac (previously from Liquid Light, also instrumental) joined Peach Pit on the second guitar, and his coming also marked departure of Beðtak which left Peach Pit as a three-piece with Franjo and Mihael on guitars and basses and Bruno on drums. Along with that, first compilation appearances were made, and Peach Pit was now open to audiences outside of Zagreb and started making materials for the first release.

Tricky Slaughter Operation cd-r (burned in 100 copies) was issued in the spring of 1998 and featured Tomica Ðãavina of Brassneck on bass (who left after the album was recorded and a short tour) and also Beðtak's guest appearance on one song. It was recorded live during a six month period in Kozmo. During that period Mihael and Franjo were also the guitar part of the Lunar with which Peach Pit shared a practice room.

Next self-release was Autom csep, which was mostly recorded by overdubbing in Kozmo in summer of 1998 and was issued along with Christmas greeting card ep which was recorded later that year. It was followed by a short concert break which was used for making of a first official album, Suspicios Cargo which was recorded in june of 1999 and was issued nine months later on Ivica Barièeviã's Earwing records. Bara also became promotor for most of the Peach Pit's concerts during that period.

Finishing of Suspicious cargo also marked Bruno Motik being recruited on second guitar, which created current lineup that exists since 1999. His coming brought complexity to songwriting and a step toward exploring new techniques which became our trademark since then.

In the summer of 2000, material for a second album (Music for the Fruitcake Generation) was recorded but was lost. That period was marked with heavy concerting which, along with a album material failure brought some problems to the band after which Peach Pit decided to take a one year break in 2001 after which a short European tour in 2003, that featured five-piece with Branko Beðtak(again) on bass, and Bruno Motik on second drums and guitar, took place. Also, Peach Pit also named a genre for the music which they are playing, sport-rock.

Later, in 2004 some of the songs from the lost material were re-recorded in Kozmo using live recording technique directly to tape and are to be released on Interstellar records Supernova 2 compilation. Four new Sport Rock songs have been recorded (26mins) in january 2006 in Kozmo, and are awaiting mix. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Peach+Pit"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2,2,the weeknd,4460501,820723188,"Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, popularly known as The Weeknd (born February 16, 1990 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), is a Canadian R&B/hip-hop musician, singer-songwriter and record producer. He chose his stage name in tribute to when he was 17 years old, when, along with his friend La Mar Taylor, he dropped out of high school, took his mattress, and ""left one weekend and never came home"". However, his estranged former producer Jeremy Rose claims the name was his idea. The letter E was excluded to avoid trademark problems with the Canadian band The Weekend.

The Weeknd gained widespread critical acclaim for his three mixtapes: House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence, which he later compiled to make a remastered, three-disc album titled Trilogy after signing his record deal with Republic. In 2013, he released Kiss Land, which was considered to be his debut studio album.

In 2014, he dropped “Often,” a remix of Beyonce’s “Drunk In Love,” and “King of the Fall.” The Weeknd released two songs in collaboration with the film Fifty Shades of Grey, with Earned It becoming his solo breakout hit.

His second studio album became highly-anticipated, with riveting singles like  The Hills and Can’t Feel My Face leaving fans hungry for more. Beauty Behind the Madness was released on August 28, 2015.

His third studio album, Starboy, was released on November 25, 2016. The Daft Punk-assisted title track led the project as its first official single, released on Wednesday, September 21, 2016, before becoming his third number one track in the United States, as also his home country, Canada. The effort was a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 albums chart with over 348,000 copies sold in its first week, all eighteen tracks debuting on the Billboard Hot 100, receiving a GRAMMY Award for the Best Urban Contemporary Album, category at the 60th annual ceremony, overall for the second time in his music career and being ranked as the third most popular album of 2017 in the U.S.

Next came the My Dear Melancholy EP, released on March 30, 2018 and revolving around his breakups with Bella Hadid during summer of 2016 and Selena Gomez in October 2017. With the lead single, Call Out My Name, the Canadian singer earned the largest first-day Spotify stream count of any song released in 2018 at that time and his eighth Top 10 entry on Hot 100.

Tesfaye’s fourth studio album (and his first in three years), After Hours was officially released on March 20, 2020, and is named after a 1985 movie directed by his idol, Martin Scorsese. It was primarily supported by November 2019-released singles Heartless and Blinding Lights, with the pair becoming his fourth and fifth #1 singles in the US and the latter his first #1 single in the UK. The title track and In Your Eyes were also released as singles.

Although widely expected to receive multiple nominations for After Hours, Tesfaye failed to receive any nominations for the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021). Tesfaye took to his social media to criticize the Recording Academy, claiming corruption. Speculation arose that the announcement of his then-upcoming Super Bowl performance as well as the discrepancy of being nominated as pop music versus R&B contributed to the snubs. On February 5, 2021 The Highlights was released, as his second greatest hits album. Tesfaye performed at the Super Bowl LV halftime show on February 7, 2021 after announcing he would perform in November 2020. He reportedly spent $7 million on his performance at the show. Despite having a mixed response, the show resulted in a surge in streaming and downloads for Tesfaye's After Hours album as well as for the seven other songs he performed.

His fifth album, Dawn FM was released on January 7, 2022, continuing the writing and production work with Swedish pop svengalis Max Martin and Oscar Holter. The album was preceded by the single Take My Breath in August 2021, with Sacrifice announced as the second single. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The group was led by singer, songwriter, and guitarist Pau Donés, whose death in 2020 caused the band to break up.

Pau Donés, born and raised in Barcelona, worked for various groups before being able to take on his current project, Jarabe de Palo. He began at age 15 with his brother Marc, with whom he formed a group known as J.& Co.Band and later another one named Dentaduras Postizas. During this period, he completed his musical tracks in Barcelona with a job at an advertising firm.

His greatest success came to him after a trip to Cuba, where he was inspired to write La Flaca which became the title of his first album, ""La Flaca,"" in 1996. A year later came the big surprise: millions of albums were sold around the world, and ""La Flaca"" became the song of the summer in 1997.

After this great success on his first album, Pau was determined to show that the band would not be a one-hit wonder, and with this idea, he launched Depende (1998), which was produced by Joe Dworniak in Moody Studios in London over two months. This album featured collaborations with the likes of Ketama and continued with Jarabe de Palo's ironic and ingenious lyrics, which managed to connect with the Hispanic public and even made inroads among Italians.

In 2001 they released De vuelta y vuelta, their most conceptual album. It showed a change in the band with the first music video of the album, in which Pau appears shaving his head, shedding his long-haired features. This album featured collaborations with the likes of Antonio Vega, Jovanotti, Vico C, and Celia Cruz.

In 2003 the band tried to show a change to more positive songs with their album Bonito, which featured the likes of Los Mártires del Compás, the singer-songwriter Elena Andujar, and their Italian friend, Jovanotti.

In the autumn of 2004, the band announced that they would go on tour with their new album, 1 m2 (Un metro cuadrado (A Square Meter)) featuring the likes of Jorge Drexler, Lucrecia, and Chrissie Hynde (The Pretenders).

The group has received great awards such as Premios de la Música, Premio Ondas, and Grammy nominations. They have collaborated with La Vieja Trova Santiaguera, Antonio Vega, Vico C and Celia Cruz (soundtrack of El milagro de P. Tinto). Pau has also composed tracks for Ricky Martin and starred in a music video with Alanis Morissette.

On 9 June 2020, Donés died near Barcelona after five years of dealing with colon cancer, causing the band to split up shortly after. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Jarabe+de+Palo"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Dua Lipa began to write her name in the music industry. Lipa gained attention from the specialized media as an artist after the release of her debut album in 2017,  ""Dua Lipa"" (self-titled). It won the third position on the UK Albums Chart and featured eight singles. ""New Rules""  and ""IDGAF"" have become global hits, reaching the number 1 position in countries such as Australia, Belgium, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, as well as reaching the top ten positions in more than 30 countries, including the USA for ""New Rules"" . The album featured the hits ""One Kiss"" with Calvin Harris, ""Be The One"", ""Scared To Be Lonely"" with Martin Garrix, ""No Lie"" with Sean Paul and many others.  It later received 5 nominations at the BRITs Awards, the most important British awards ceremony in music. She also won with her debut album two Grammys, ""Best Dance Recording"" for her song ""Electricity"" with Silk City, and moreover the ""Best New Artist"" award. ""Dua Lipa"" (self-titled) is the most streamed female album of all-time on Spotify.

But Lipa's great success would even come in her second album ""Future Nostalgia"", which made the promising young woman a true pillar of world pop music. Having hits such as ""Don't Start Now"", ""Break My Heart"" and ""Levitating"" , the album is currently the most played female album of the 2020's decade on Spotify and secured a Grammy at the 2021 ceremony for ""Best Pop Vocal Album"" and was present among the nominations for ""Album of the Year"".

""Don't Start Now"" became her most streamed hit on Spotify, nominated for ""Record of the Year"" at the Grammys. It was the biggest female song of the year 2020.

The British phenomenon has captured an all-time record on the Billboard Hot 100, all thanks to the success of ""Levitating"". The track became the longest-charting female song on the chart, with 77 weeks, being the 4th song overall to reach this astonishing feat. The same track became the biggest hit of 2021 in the United States and globally without ever reaching #1, proving once and for all that the disputed #1 position on the Billboard Hot 100, that she still doesn't have reached, doesn't define the success of an artist. For Lipa, it seems that longevity is more important than an instant success.

Her song, ""Cold Heart""  with  Elton John and  PNAU, was one of the biggest hits of 2022. She had during that year a sold-out global stadium and arena tour with ""The Future Nostalgia Tour"", marking her as a definitive icon of the beginning of the 2020's decade, especially in the European continent, her main music market.

She began her third album cycle in 2024, while also making her acting debut that year with ""Barbie"" and ""Argylle"" in 2024.

Dreamland reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and number seven on the US Billboard 200, driven in part by the massive success of “Heat Waves.” The song, which became a global hit through TikTok, eventually topped charts worldwide, including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and achieved over two billion Spotify streams by 2022. The album was promoted with singles like “Tokyo Drifting” featuring rapper Denzel Curry and “Your Love (Déjà Vu)”.

21,21,taylor swift,5034995,2858332274,"Taylor Alison Swift is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise.

Swift rose to mainstream prominence with her sophomore studio album, Fearless (2008), a country pop record with crossover appeal. Aided by the top-five singles “Love Story” and “You Belong with Me”, Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Swift's third studio album, Speak Now (2010), blended country pop with elements of rock and featured the top-ten singles “Mine” and “Back to December”.

Drawing inspiration from various pop, rock, and electronic genres, Swift's fourth studio album Red (2012) saw her transcending her country roots. She completely moved to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), and expanded the electropop sound on her next two studio albums, reputation (2017) and Lover (2019), which respectively embraced urban and retro styles. The four albums spawned a string of international top-five singles, including “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”, “I Knew You Were Trouble”, “Shake It Off”, “Blank Space”, “Bad Blood”, “Look What You Made Me Do”, “ME! (feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco)”, “You Need to Calm Down”, and “Lover”.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift experimented with folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums, folklore and evermore (both 2020), whose lead singles “cardigan” and “willow” topped charts around the world. She also released the critically acclaimed documentaries Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions that year. Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights (2022), marked her triumphant return to pop after two folk albums. The album set the record for biggest first day and first week ever on Spotify, spawned the hits Anti-Hero and Lavender Haze, and sold over 1.5 million copies in its first week becoming not only the biggest debut of the decade but also Swift's biggest debut ever. She would make history by becoming the first artist to occupy the entire top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 with tracks from Midnights.

Additionally, Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020 as a result of a publicized dispute with talent manager Scooter Braun and her former label Big Machine, regarding the acquisition of the masters of her back catalog. In April 2021, Swift released a re-recorded issue of her 2008 album Fearless, titled Fearless (Taylor's Version). It debuted at number one in the US. Swift continued releasing re-recorded versions of her back catalog in November, 2021 with the release of Red (Taylor's Version), a 30 track re-issue of her 2012 critical smash. The album debuted at #1 in the US, spawned the #1 hit All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From the Vault), and broke the record at the time for biggest first day for a female album on Spotify. Red (Taylor's Version) was a critical and commercial hit, and proved that Swift's ambitious, yet ongoing plan to re-record her first 6 albums was well worth it.

Along with the release of Red (Taylor's Version) came All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), Swift's filmmaking debut. The 15 minute romantic drama was based on the lyrical content from Swift's 2012 fan favorite “All Too Well” starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien. It had a limited theatrical release in major cities, and Swift held special screenings of the film throughout 2022 at various film festivals. In December, 2022 Taylor announced that she would be making her feature directorial debut with Oscar-winning studio Searchlight Pictures.

Following the release of Midnights, Swift would embark on her first tour in five years, The Eras Tour—a retrospective tour covering the entirety of her discography. During her ongoing tour, Swift would release her next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) in July and 1989 (Taylor's Version) in October of 2023. The former of which would land Swift as the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand. The latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, her largest album sales in a week span. “Is It Over Now? (Taylor's Version)”, the lead single for 1989 (Taylor's Version), would peak at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.

At the 66th annual GRAMMY Awards, Taylor Swift surprised viewers by announcing her eleventh studio album, THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT. On April 19, 2024, the album was released globally, breaking records: it became the first ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week and sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US. Swift dominated the charts, monopolizing the top 14 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 and securing the top 10 positions on Australia’s ARIA Singles Chart. The lead single, Fortnight, featuring Post Malone, quickly soared to the number-one position on the Hot 100. Additionally, just two hours after the album’s release, Swift surprised fans with a reissue titled THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY, which included 15 extra songs.

Swift has released several songs for film soundtracks.

She also contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: “Safe & Sound - from The Hunger Games Soundtrack”, co-written and recorded with The Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, and “Eyes Open”. “Safe & Sound” won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In 2013, Swift recorded “Sweeter than Fiction”, a song she wrote and produced with Jack Antonoff for the One Chance film soundtrack, which received a Best Original Song nomination at the 71st Golden Globe Awards. Swift and English singer Zayn Malik, mononymously known as Zayn, released a single together, “I Don't Wanna Live Forever”, for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). She also recorded an original song called “Beautiful Ghosts”, which she wrote with Andrew Lloyd Webber for the Cats's soundtrack (2019). In 2020, Swift's documentary Miss Americana featured the song “Only the Young” which was written after the 2018 United States elections. In 2022, she released an original song titled “Carolina” for Where The Crawdads Sing (2022) inspired by the novel written by Delia Owens.

With sales of over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is a best-selling music artist. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, including four Album of the Year wins, which makes Swift the artist with the most awards for that category in history, two Brit Awards (including a Global Icon award), an Emmy Award, 28 Guinness World Records, 32 American Music Awards (the most wins by an artist), and 23 Billboard Music Awards (the most wins by a woman). She ranked eighth on Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists Chart (2019) and was listed on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015). Swift has been included in various power rankings, such as Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2010, 2015 and 2019) and Forbes Celebrity 100 (placing first in 2016 and 2019).

The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several world tours.

The group initially formed as teenagers under Big Hit Entertainment and released their debut single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. Billboard 200 entries The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 (2015), The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016), and Wings (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. Wings became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea.

Born and raised in the outskirts of Barcelona, she has been described as an ""untypical pop star"" due to her genre-bending musical styles. After being enthralled by Spanish folk music at age 13, she studied musicology at Catalonia College of Music while also performing at musical bars and weddings. She completed her studies with honors by virtue of her collaborative cover album with Raül Refree, Los Ángeles and the baccalaureate project El Mal Querer. Reimagining flamenco by mixing it with pop and hip-hop music, it spawned the singles ""Malamente"" and ""Pienso en Tu Mirá"", which caught the attention of the Spanish general public, and were released to universal critical acclaim. Recipient of the Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year and listed in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, El Mal Querer started the ascent of ROSALÍA into the international music scene.

ROSALÍA explored urbano music with her 2019 releases ""Con Altura"" and ""Yo x Ti, Tu x Mí"", achieving global success. She gave reggaeton an experimental twist on her third studio album MOTOMAMI, departing from the new flamenco sound of its predecessor. The album caught international attention with its singles ""La Fama"" and ""Saoko"" and became the best-reviewed album of the year on Metacritic.

Throughout her career, ROSALÍA has accumulated ten number-one singles in her home country, the most for a local artist. She has also won a Grammy Award, eleven Latin Grammy Awards (including two Album of the Year wins), four MTV Video Music Awards, an MTV Europe Music Award, two UK Music Video Awards, and two Premio Ruido awards, among others. In 2019, Billboard gave her the Rising Star Award for ""changing the sound of today's mainstream music with her fresh flamenco-influenced pop"", and became the first Spanish-singing act in history to be nominated for Best New Artist at the Grammys. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Rosal%C3%ADa"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

51,51,drake,5929297,831656803,"Aubrey ""Drake"" Graham (born October 24, 1986) is an Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and businessman. Drake was an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s. Intent on pursuing a career in music, he left the series in 2007 after releasing his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.

Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum. His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same, were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late and collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of which earned platinum certification in the U.S. His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records. The dancehall-influenced album sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over 10 years. The album's second single, ""One Dance"", topped the charts in several countries, and became his first number-one single as a lead artist. That year, Drake led both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts simultaneously for eight weeks.

Views achieved quadruple platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. It became Drake's best-selling album to date. Its lead single ""Hotline Bling"" peaked at number two on the Hot 100 and received Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song, as well as ""One Dance"" which was proclaimed the song of the summer in 2016. In 2017, he released the ""playlist"" More Life. It became his seventh consecutive number one on the Billboard 200, and set multiple streaming records. A year later, he released the double album Scorpion, which also broke several streaming records, and contains the Grammy Award winning number-one single ""God's Plan"", and the bounce-infused number one singles ""Nice for What"" and ""In My Feelings"".

Among the world's best-selling music artists, with over 170 million records sold worldwide, he is ranked by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) as the world's highest-certified digital singles artist. Drake holds several Billboard chart records. He has the most charted songs (205) among solo artists in the history of the Billboard Hot 100, the most simultaneously charted Hot 100 songs in a single week (27), the most time on the Hot 100 (431 weeks) and the most Hot 100 debuts in a week (22). He also has the most number one singles on the Hot Rap Songs, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay and Rhythmic Charts. Drake has also won four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, twenty-seven Billboard Music Awards and three Juno Awards. As an entrepreneur, Drake has founded the OVO Sound record label with longtime collaborator 40 in 2012.

Early life
Drake attended both Forest Hill Collegiate Institute (left) and Vaughan Road Academy (right) during high school.
Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practicing Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Drake's mother, Sandra ""Sandi"" Graham (née Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. His parents met after Dennis performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he first interacted with Sandra, who was in attendance. He is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day school, and formally celebrated becoming a Bar Mitzvah in a religious service.

Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Dennis' limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the United States until Drake's early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, however, Dennis would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer. His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song titled ""Drake's Dad"". Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell records, which Drake vehemently denies.

Drake was raised in two Toronto neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end until grade six, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighborhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move, Drake replied, ""[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement; my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.""

He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school. He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighborhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighborhood, Drake described the school as ""not by any means the easiest school to go to."" Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background, and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school. He later graduated in October 2012.

Career - 2001–2005: Degrassi: The Next Generation
At 15, eager to begin as an actor, a high school friend introduced Drake to his father, who was an acting agent. The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks a basketball star who became physically disabled after a classmate shot him. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, ""My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV"". He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, returning for sporadic appearances until his character graduated from school. Overall, Drake appeared in a total of 145 episodes.

2006–2009: Early mixtapes and So Far Gone
Lil Wayne, the founder of Young Money Entertainment, would sign Drake to the label in 2009.
After becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as ""pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it."" The mixtape was released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies. In 2007, he released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single ""Replacement Girl"", featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever-unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with ""Replacement Girl"" being featured on the channel's ""New Joint of the Day"" segment on April 30, 2007. The song also saw Drake sample ""Man of the Year"" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including ""Ransom"", ""Forever"", and a remix to ""Brand New"". Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.

In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles ""Best I Ever Had"" and ""Successful"", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs ""I'm Goin' In"" and ""Fear"". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.

Due to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as ""one of the biggest bidding wars ever"". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album titled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means.

Drake then joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of ""Best I Ever Had"" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He underwent surgery later that year.

2010–2012: Thank Me Later and Take Care
Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.

On March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single ""Over"", which peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, ""Find Your Love"", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[76] The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, ""]Care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image]."" The third single and fourth singles, ""Miss Me"" and ""Fancy"" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.

Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.

It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire on May 8, and he had also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.

Beginning his second effort in fall 2010, Drake announced his intentions to allow for Noah ""40"" Shebib to handle most of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me Later, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and others. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be Take Care. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, ""I didn't get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed many of the songs and sonically I didn't get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round."" Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.

In January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie, to focus on the album. ""Dreams Money Can Buy"" and ""Marvins Room"" were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track listing, while ""Marvins Room"" gained Gold certification by the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio. Drake would soon release the song's music video on June 28.

""Headlines"" was released on August 9, acting as the lead single for Take Care. It was met with positive critical and commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12. It was eventually certified Platinum in both the United States and Canada. The music video for the single was released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game in January 2012. ""Make Me Proud"" was released as the album's second single, on October 16. It was the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number nine the following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88. ""Make Me Proud"" soon became Drake's fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.

Prior to the album's release, Drake had planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne, however, it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne. He had also begun collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled Y.O.L.O., but the duo decided against the project, in favor of increased concern for their respective studio albums.

Take Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. John McDonnell of NME dubbed it ""an affecting masterpiece"" and commended its ""delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive lyrics."" Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal found Drake's ""technical abilities"" to be improved and stated, ""Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up."" Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice called it ""a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West."" Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented the depth of Drake's ""moral psychodramas"" and stated, ""the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying power."" It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial success, eventually being certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the US.

The album's third and fourth singles, ""The Motto"" and Take Care"", were released on November 29, and February 21, 2012 respectively. Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with ""The Motto"" credited for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States. The music video for ""Take Care"" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, ""None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] - make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it."" The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year. The song was also featured on the channel's ""Pop Songs You Must Hear"" list of 2011. ""HYFR"" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified Gold. It would later win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video in 2012, and the channel also ranked him at number two on their ""Hottest MCs in the Game"" list.

In promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip-hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million. He then returned to acting, starring in Ice Age: Continental Drift as Ethan.

2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and commercial mixtapes
During the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer's influence over his next album. Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics prevalent previously.

In January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off of his third album at the conclusion of the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of his third album. The album's second single, ""Hold On, We're Going Home"", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful single off of the album, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song's music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the video. Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing the album's third single, ""Too Much"", alongside featured artist Sampha.

Nothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favorable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in 808s & Heartbreak. The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further promoted by the ""Would You like a Tour?"" throughout late 2013, to early 2014. It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million. Drake then returned to acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night Live, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what ""kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters"". Drake also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city. In late 2014, Drake announced that he had begun recording sessions for his fourth studio album.

In 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the Romeo Santos song Odio. He also appeared on a remix of Tuesday by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard's Rhythmic chart and number twelve on the ""Hot 100"", and released ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"" as a non-album single. The latter went double platinum in the United States.

On February 12, 2015, Drake released If You're Reading This It's Too Late onto iTunes, with no prior announcement. Despite debate on whether it is an album or a mixtape, its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money Records, a scheme that was rumored to allow Drake to leave the label. However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and If You're Reading This It's Too Late sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall. Drake proceeded If You're Reading This It's Too Late with a collaborative mixtape with Future, which was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week.

What a Time to Be Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Drake the first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the same year since 2004. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units. Drake also appeared on the cover of The Fader for their 100th issue.

2016–2017: Views and More Life
Drake announced in January 2016 that his fourth studio album would be launched during the spring, releasing the promotional single ""Summer Sixteen"" later that month. The album was originally titled Views from the six, but would later be shortened to Views. ""Summer Sixteen"" debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip-hop to more tenured artists. This move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as ""goodly brash"" or ""conventionally disrespectful."" It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake popularizing the term ""The Six"" when referencing Toronto. Drake also crashed a Bat Mitzvah in New York City on February 20, performing at the event.

Drake soon released the album's lead singles, ""Pop Style"" and the dancehall-infused ""One Dance"", on April 5. Both debuted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with ""One Dance"" becoming Drake's first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist. The single also became Drake's first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed the album's release date of April 29, and followed it up with various promotional videos. On October 15, ""One Dance"" became Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016.

Views was previewed in London, before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being made available to various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later to release a short film titled Please Forgive Me, starring frequent collaborators, Swedish twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta. As of 2019, Views remains Drake's best-selling album.

Drake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as the show's musical guest. Later, Drake was named as a member of the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury. During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the music video for ""Child's Play"" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics. On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views. At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Drake received the most nominations, with 10, winning the awards for Album of the Year and Best Hip-Hop Video. Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the course of the tour in Europe. Seven additional dates were added a day later due to overwhelming demands.

Soon after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed he would be releasing a project titled More Life in December, however he later pushed the date back to the new year. The project was described as a ""playlist of original music"", rather than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album. He was later revealed to be Spotify's most streamed artist for the second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion streams for all projects on the service, which is more than double the amount of streams he had in 2015. Drake later secured his second and third Grammy Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony. Despite multiple setbacks, Drake announced More Life would be released on March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials released through Instagram. Upon release, More Life received mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200, earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It also set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever streamed album in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music alone. The album also garnered 61.3 million streams on Spotify, dethroning Ed Sheeran's ÷ as the highest opening on the service in a single day. He later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins in a single show. Billboard also reported Drake had been present on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has the most recorded entries by a solo artist.

He then released the single ""Signs"" on June 24, as well as reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset. The singles marked his first releases since More Life, with ""Signs"" was initially released as a collaboration between Drake and French fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the ""Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2018"" fashion show. The event also had a playlist exclusively from OVO Sound, curated by label co-founder Oliver El-Khatib. Drake later hosted the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of Virginia Black. Drake then appeared in The Carter Effect documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince Carter, who was the first superstar player to appear for the Toronto Raptors since the franchise's inception in 1995. The documentary also featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and LeBron James.

2018: Scorpion and return to television
After rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer Pi'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017. Two songs would later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on January 20, 2018, marking Drake's first solo release since More Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring on a remix of the Jay-Z song ""Family Feud"" with Lil Wayne, as the lead single of the latter's Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape. Scary Hours featured the songs ""Diplomatic Immunity"" and ""God's Plan"", which both debuted within the top-ten, with the latter eventually breaking various streaming records as it debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was Drake's second as a solo artist to reach number one.

Drake earned his 70th top 40 hit after featuring on the Migos song ""Walk It Talk It"", which debuted at number eighteen, and peaked at number ten. He later featured on BlocBoy JB's debut single, ""Look Alive"", which was released on February 9, 2018. The song's entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper with the top 10 hits on the Hot 100, with 23. He then featured on a remix to ""Lemon"", a song originally released as collaboration between band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, Drake announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was releasing a single later that night. On April 6, ""Nice for What"" was released, alongside a music video, which featured several female celebrities.

After ""Nice For What"" replaced his own ""God's Plan"" on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace their former number-one debut, Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion, with a planned release date of June 29, 2018. He then released ""I'm Upset"" on May 26, as the album's third single. Scorpion was then released as a double-album, and marked Drake's longest project, with a run-time of just under 90 minutes. The album broke both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it gained 132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming service, respectively. It eventually sold 749,000 album equivalent units in its first week of sales, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.

Shortly thereafter, Drake collaborated with British hip hop promotion Link Up TV on July 7, releasing a freestyle as a part of the promotion's 'Behind Barz' segment, before releasing another freestyle a week later after featuring on Charlie Sloth's long-running Fire in the Booth program on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Drake then earned his sixth number-one hit with ""In My Feelings"" on July 21, which also spawned the viral ""#InMyFeelingsChallenge"" or ""#KiKiChallenge"". The success of ""In My Feelings"" also made Drake the record holder for most number one hits among rappers. Soon after, he released the music video for ""Nonstop"", which was filmed in London during his surprise performance at the Wireless Festival.

He then appeared on the album Astroworld, featuring uncredited vocals for the song ""Sicko Mode"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Drake announced in July 2018 that he planned to ""take 6 months to a year"" to himself in order to produce television and films, including Euphoria. He then began the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour with co-headliners Migos on August 12. This preceded collaboration with Bad Bunny titled ""Mia"", which featured Drake performing in Spanish. He later received the award for Hot Ticket Performer at the 2018 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 16. During a performance in Edmonton on November 7, Drake announced his intention to begin composing his next project in early 2019.

2019–present: Upcoming album
In February 2019, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rap Song, for ""God's Plan"", at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. During his speech, producers abruptly cut to a commercial break, leading viewers to speculate they were censoring his speech during which he criticized The Recording Academy. A legal representative for the Academy then released a statement stating ""a natural pause [led] the producers [to] assume that he was done and cut to commercial,"" and added the organization offered him an opportunity to return to stage, but he declined.

On February 14, Drake re-released his third mixtape, So Far Gone, onto streaming services for the first time to commemorate its 10-year anniversary, and later collaborated with Summer Walker on a remix of Walker's song ""Girls Need Love"", marking his first release of 2019. On April 10, 2019 during a London performance on his Assassination Vacation Tour, the OVO leader told the crowd he was working on his new album before the show. On June 8, Drake appeared on Chris Brown's single ""No Guidance"". On June 15, Drake released two songs, ""Omertà"" and ""Money in the Grave"", on his EP The Best in the World Pack to celebrate the NBA Championship win of the Toronto Raptors. On August 2, he released the compilation album Care Package, consisting of songs released between 2010 and 2016 that were initially unavailable for purchase or commercial streaming; it debuted at number one.

Artistry - influences
Drake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West, Jay Z, and Lil Wayne, while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah, and Usher. Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his ""biggest inspirations"".

Musical style
Drake has credited Kanye West (left) and Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical influences. Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism. His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as ""ting"", ""touching road"", ""talkin' boasy"" and ""gwanin' wassy"". Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip-hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing. He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.

The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional or boastful. However, Drake is often revered for incorporating ""degrading"" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between ""pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata."" Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as ""hyper-reality rap"", which is characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as being distinct from the ""real world.""

Public image
The Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States, with his single, ""The Motto"", which includes, ""You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO."" Drake later popularized the term ""The Six"" in 2015 in relation his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city. Furthermore, the subject matter of his artistry often revolving around relationships, have had widespread impact on social media through photo captions commonly used to reference emotions or personal situations. However, his lyrical contents have had a negative reception from fans and critics deeming him as sensitive; a trait that is understood as being antithetical to hip hop culture. June 10 was declared ""Drake Day"" in Houston, Texas. In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines, in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance. In 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States. He would also donate $200,000 in order to aid relief efforts in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey. In February 2018, following the single ""God's Plan"" debut at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Drake donated $50,000 to a Miami homeless shelter and giving a University of Miami student $50,000 to help with her tuition. Drake then ""kept up the spending spree"" by donating the rest of the song's video budget, $996,631.90, to several charitable causes and regular people across Miami.

The music video for ""Hotline Bling"" went viral, due to Drake's eccentric choices in dancing. The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake's unconventional nature on the song, causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, spawning several parodies. Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exampled by the video for ""Hotline Bling"". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6"" Classic Boots. This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose, in which various items of clothing were produced. Drake had also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the ""Air Jordan OVOs"". Moreover, his style and dress sense have caused GQ magazine to describe him as ""[one of] the most stylish men alive"".

Controversies - legal issues
In 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on ""Marvins Room"". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties. Despite Drake's legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling ""Jimmy Smith Rap"", a 1982 single by jazz musician, Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who stated Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on ""Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2"", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop. Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement. Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics on when collaborating with YG on the song ""Who Do You Love?"". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year. In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.

In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel ""Chubbs"" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also says the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering. The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu, after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference; the judge ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense.

Feuds
Drake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident and released a song criticizing Drake weeks later. Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute.

In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe magazine. Drake would later respond on ""6 God"" and ""6PM in New York"", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment.

Further controversy arose in July 2015, when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during recording sessions for ""RICO"", one of the lead singles off of Mill's second studio album. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller. Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for ""R.I.C.O."". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for ""R.I.C.O."", ""10 Bands"", and ""Know Yourself"". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, titled ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back"", in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with ""Wanna Know"", before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later. Despite subliminal disses from either artist, the feud has not been officially reignited. Drake would further seek to denounce Funkmaster Flex during his Madison Square Garden shows on the Summer Sixteen Tour. Following Meek Mill's sentencing of two to four years for probation violation, Drake stated ""Free Meek Mill"" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on ""Family Feud"". Pusha T would also use the same rationale to criticize Drake on ""Infrared"" in 2018, prompting Drake to respond with the ""Duppy Freestyle"" diss track on May 25. Pusha T would directly respond to the track through ""The Story of Adidon"" on May 29, which presented several claims, including an accusation of Drake fathering a secret child. The pair is considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, with Drake yet to respond to ""The Story of Adidon"".

In 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through ""4PM in Calabasas"", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on ""No Shopping"" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song. However, French Montana claimed that Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake, he has yet to officially respond to Budden. In the same year, Drake mocked Kid Cudi for his mental health, drug use and suicidal urges on ""Two Birds, One Stone"" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter. Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.

In mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator, Kanye West. In an appearance on the talk show The Shop in October, Drake recounted several business meetings with West, who voiced his desire to ""be Quincy Jones"" and work with him, in order to replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson. West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, which was agreed to as Drake ""felt a genuine vibe"" from West, and after West gifted him the beat to ""Lift Yourself"", which inspired Drake to begin writing to the instrumental. West then requested Drake to travel to Wyoming to continue working, and arrived a day after close friend 40. 40 said West was working on an album; contradictory to his previous aim of just wanting to ""give [Drake] beats"". Drake responded by saying West stated he would release in late 2018, and they should continue on. However, upon his arrival in Wyoming, Drake ""[spent] the majority of time working on [West's] music"", only exploring his own after playing the producer the song ""March 14"", which addresses Drake's relationship with his newborn son and co-parent. This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T. West would also release ""Lift Yourself"", and produce ""Infrared""; actions that greatly displeased Drake. This prompted him to denounce West in several songs and live performances. West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018.

Drake has purported to have been in reported feuds with DMX, Kendrick Lamar, Common, The Weeknd, XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez, and Ludacris, although the latter three have been reported to be resolved.

Business ventures - Endorsements
Prior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient. In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger King and Whataburger. Business magazine Forbes commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships ""combined heavily"" for Drake's reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the highest-paid celebrities during that period.

Main article: OVO Sound
During the composition of Nothing Was the Same, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, and business partner, Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the trio to team up to form OVO Sound. The name is an abbreviation derived from the October's Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects. Warner Bros. Records currently distribute the label.

Drake, 40 and PartyNextDoor were the label's inaugural artists. The label houses artists including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, OB O'Brien, Roy Woods, dvsn, Plaza, and Kash Doll, as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Mike Zombie, Nineteen85, and Future the Prince. OVO Sound has released six albums, with two certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Toronto Raptors
On September 30, 2013, at a press conference with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke, Drake was announced as the new ""global ambassador"" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. This would also be the setting where Drake was given The Key to the City. In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities, beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary. He began by hosting an annual ""Drake Night"" segment with the organization, which began in 2013.

Apple Music
Following the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million. This saw all future solo releases by Drake becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers. Drake had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted More Life. Drake's partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform's sharp success, as it attained 10 million subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists, such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services. Through signing with the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before the smartwatch saw public release.

Virginia Black
Two months prior to the release of Views, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based whiskey. This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring's Restaurant in Toronto. The beverage was created and also distributed alongside Proximo Spirits, as well as with Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008. The company described the partnership as ""fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey.""

The product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically. The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music and various tours, such as being part of the ""Virginia Black VIP Lounge"" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016. The company later aired commercials with Dennis Graham, which featured the tagline of ""The Realest Dude Ever"" (in reference toward ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to various European countries in 2017.

Personal life
Drake lives in Hidden Hills, California, since 2012. He also owns a property in Toronto, which was built from the ground-up in 2017, and a Toronto condo adjacent to the CN Tower. He owns a Boeing 767 airplane.

Drake's paternal uncles are bass guitarist Larry Graham and musician Teenie Hodges. Graham achieved both critical and commercial success as a member of the band Sly and the Family Stone, while Hodges featured as the lead guitarist and songwriter for Al Green, and contributed heavily on much of his work in the 1970s, including the hits ""Take Me to the River"", ""Love and Happiness"", and ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"".

Drake is a father to one son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French artist Sophie Brussaux. Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumors after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017; Drake eventually confirmed his fatherhood on the album Scorpion in 2018.

Drake dated singer Rihanna off-and-on from 2009 to 2016. He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums, and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said ""she's a woman I've been in love with since I was 22 years old."" On becoming a single parent, he mused on the talk show The Shop:

As life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don't have the fairy tale, like, 'Oh, Drake started a family with Rihanna and this is like so perfect.' It looks so good on paper. By the way, I wanted that too at one time.

The group debuted in August 2016 with their single album SQUARE ONE which featured ""WHISTLE"" and ""BOOMBAYAH"".

Dubbed the ""biggest girl group in the world"", they are considered the most successful Korean girl group internationally and one of the leaders of the Korean Wave. They are stylistically associated with the ""girl crush"" concept in K-pop—exploring themes of self-confidence and female empowerment.

BLACKPINK released their debut single album, SQUARE ONE, on August 8, 2016, consisting of tracks ""BOOMBAYAH"" and ""WHISTLE"".

53,53,black eyed peas,5209628,122077643,"Black Eyed Peas is an American hip hop/pop group formed in Los Angeles in 1995. The group's current line-up consists of will.i.am, Taboo and apl.de.ap. Black Eyed Peas have so-far sold an estimated 56 million albums and singles worldwide.

Black Eyed Peas went to centenary state high school and got their start in 1988 when will.i.am (born 1975 William James Adams Jr.) and apl.de.ap (born 1974 Allan Pineda) began rapping and performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to Ruthless Records (run by Eazy-E) after catching the attention of the nephew of Jerry Heller (Eazy-E's manager). Along with Mookie Mook (Burning Star), Dante Santiago & DJ Motiv8, they called their group A.T.B.A.N. Klann. Their debut album, 'Grass Roots', was not released originally because Ruthless did not consider the social themes reflected in the group's music to be marketable to their audience. A single ""Puddles of H2O"" was released in 1994 but no album was released (until it leaked onto the Internet in the mid 2000s). 

After Eazy-E died of an AIDS related illness in 1995, they changed their name to Black Eyed Peas; will.i.am explained on the front cover of the Monkey Business album that ""Black Eyed Peas are food for the soul"", hence the name. will.i.am has cited the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an influence and said he named his band after a food, like them. They replaced their original third member Mookie, with Dante Santiago the Peas original singer. Then Taboo (born Jaime Gomez) joined the group. Dante Santiago took on a role as a guest vocalist in the band and featured frequently on various tracks for their first four albums. 

In 1996, they produced and appeared on a song entitled ""That's Right"" for Brian Austin Green's hip-hop album One Stop Carnival. Later, they began using Kim Hill as a steady background singer. Unlike many hip-hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a musical and clothing style that differed wildly from the ""gangsta rap"" sounds of other Los Angeles-based hip-hop acts at the time. Through the mid-'90s, they performed in the local club circuit alongside fellow acts such as Ozomatli and Jurassic 5.

The group were signed to Interscope Records and released their debut, ""Behind the Front"", in 1998. The album won the group (and their accompanying live band, the Bucky Jonsons) critical acclaim. The album featured the single ""Joints & Jams"", which was included on the Bulworth soundtrack. Their second album, ""Bridging the Gap"", was released in 2000; it featured the single ""Request + Line"" featuring Macy Gray.

After replacing their female background singer with Fergie, the group released their breakout album, ""Elephunk"", and their 2005 album, ""Monkey Business"", which featured the hit singles ""Pump It"", ""Don't Phunk With My Heart"", ""Don't Lie"" and ""My Humps"".

""The E.N.D. (The Energy Never Dies)"", their fifth album, was released worldwide in June 2009 and has managed to sell 5 million copies in 8 months (Elephunk: 7 million, Monkey Business: 10 million). It already spawned 2 of the most downloaded singles of all time: ""Boom Boom Pow"" and ""I Gotta Feeling"", both were downloaded 5 million times only in the USA. The 3rd single ""Meet Me Halfway"" was downloaded 2 million times and the 4th ""Imma Be"", which was just released, already sold 1 million. ""Rock That Body"" is the 5th single.

54,54,danna paola,232386,7612761,"Danna Paola Rivera Munguía (born June 23, 1995). Beginning at the age of four, Mexico's Danna Paola has lived in the pop-culture spotlight. The winner of many acting and singing awards, Paola began her career as a member of the Mexican television cast of Sesame Street, then at age six won her first leading role in the children's telenovela María Belén and cut her debut album, Mi Globo Azul. The irrepressible youngster with the killer dance moves became a pop sensation at nine with the charting Océano, even as she claimed lead roles in the telenovela Amy, La Niña de la Mochila Azul and the stage production Anita la Huerfanita. As her singing voice deepened, she became even more successful. By the time she was 17, she had issued five full-length albums and a handful of singles amid her dizzying pace as an actress. Paola retreated from actively pursuing pop music for a time before releasing a trilogy of singles in 2018. She returned to Latin pop in earnest with 2019's hit SIE7E EP.
Born in 1995, Mexican telenovela star and pop singer Danna Paola Rivera Munguia (aka Danna Paola) has been working since she was four years old when she and her sister were taken by her mother to audition for Mexico City's television production of Sesame Street. They appeared in several episodes, but Paola proved talented enough for producers and agents to see her captivating charm exploding from the screen. In 2000, she won a high-profile role in the childhood telenovela Rayito de Luz. A year later, she was cast the lead role in María Belén, which she played for a whopping 95 episodes, going to school on set. Though she made guest and single-episode appearances in other television shows and films, Paola also continued to sing. In 2001, age six, the same year she won the lead in María Belén, Paola issued her debut album, Mi Globo Azul, singing children's songs with slick pop arrangements. Though the record didn't chart, it raised her profile nationally. There was no time to tour, but the singer promoted the album with appearances on television variety shows.
Over the next three years, Paola continued with María Belén, as well as select theater appearances. In 2004, at age nine, she issued her sophomore long-player, Océano, and won the lead role in the series Amy, La Niña de la Mochila Azul -- she played it for 115 episodes. The success of the series and the album fed one another; the long-player registered well inside the radio airplay charts Top 40. For the next five years, Paola's acting and musical careers intersected. In 2005, she took on another (additional) weekly role: that of Andrea Saavedra in the telenovela Pablo y Andrea, yet managed to issue her third studio outing, Chiquita Pero Picosa, and undertake a short tour. Given the intensity of her acting career --including making her film debut in 2008's Tear This Heart Out -- Paola continued to record but could not tour. In 2009, her twin careers fused when she signed on to a role in the teen telenovela Atrévete a Soñar, and cut her first true pop record (with the same title) that purposely emerged out of her character's role. Though the album only charted marginally, the series was a smash, and Paola appeared in 261 episodes of Atrévete a Soñar. She would go on to many other television and film roles, and was featured in a Spanish version of Winnie the Pooh released in 2011.
The following year, Paola's career, as if not active enough already, went into overdrive. While the filming schedule for Atrévete a Soñar was grueling, she also took on voice-over roles in several films. However, Paola was also seriously considering music. With her vocal range still expanding, she released a self-titled outing during the late summer of 2012. Its first single, ''Ruleta,"" went to number 20 on the radio charts, while the second, ""Todo Fue un Show,"" peaked at number six, pushing the album well into the Mexican Top 40. That same year, she auditioned to play the role of Elphaba in a Spanish-language stage production of the musical Wicked. Paola won the role. She issued a Top 20 single, ""No Es Cierto,"" with Noel Schajris before going on the road with the musical for the next two years. She released only one more single for the next several years, a 2014 cover of ""Take a Chance on Me"" for the Universal compilation Dancing Queens: Un Tributo Para ABBA.
In 2015, Paola took on a main role of Paloma Hernández in the telenovela ¿Quién Es Quién?, playing it for 115 episodes, and later that year, claimed the lead role in the musical Hoy No Me Puedo Levantar thru 2016, when she secured a key role in the first season of the Telemundo series La Doña. After the first season, she played a recurring guest-starring role over the next four years. Paola appeared in 115 episodes yet still managed to appear in films and in the first 11 episodes of the dramatic series José José, El Príncipe de la Canción in 2018; she also signed on to play Lucrecia ""Lu"" Montesinos Hendrich in the ongoing Spanish-speaking Netflix series Elite. 
Paola chose 2018 as the year to return to recording as well. She issued the provocative modern salsa single ""So Good,"" followed by the Latin pop ballad ""Lo Que No Sabes"" and the steamy electro-Cumbia track ""Final Feliz."" While the singles reached only the bottom rungs of the charts, between Paola's television appearances and interviews, they created anticipation. In 2019, she issued the video single for ""La Fama""; it registered some 250 million views and marked the first of five singles to appear that year. The others included ""Know Me Too Well"" with New Hope Club and the gold- and platinum-certified ""Oye Pablo."" She also issued a ""Siento Amor,"" a disco-fied salsa cover of Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love."" At year's end, Paolo released the seven-track EP SIE7E, which featured HRVY's remix of ""So Good"" and ""Mala Fama."" 
In February 2020, Paola was as active musically as she was onscreen. She released SIE7E+, an expanded edition of the previous year's EP that included its seven tracks appended by an additional five. It peaked at 16 on the Latin Pop Albums Chart. She subsequently released four singles including the chart-topping cuarentena hit ""Sodio,"" and ""TQ Y YA"" and ""Contigo."" The latter two were chosen as unofficial anthems of Brazil's annual LGBTQ+ Pride Parade. In late July, Paola issued ""No Bailes Sola,"" a duet with Sebastian Yatra, and it entered the Latin singles chart at 16. ~ Thom Jurek & Chris True <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Danna+Paola"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Singles followed, including her savvy 2022 cover of Hole's ""Celebrity Skin"" 2022's ""Vegas"" off the Elvis soundtrack, and 2023's trip-hop-inflected ""Attention"" all of which spotlighted Doja's adventurous, genre-crossing sensibilities. The latter track and ""Paint the Town Red"" appeared on her fourth album, 2023's Scarlet, which found her digging deep into her rap and hip-hop roots and became her third consecutive album to hit the Top Ten of the Billboard 200. Doja Cat was born Amala Zandile Dlamini in 1995 in Tarzana, California, the daughter of South African actor Dumisani Dlamini and painter Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer. After moving to New York for a few years, she returned to California with her mother. As a child, she studied piano and took tap, ballet, and jazz dance lessons. She also discovered surfing and breakdancing. By her teens, she was teaching herself to sing and listening to an eclectic mix of hip-hop, indie rock, R&B, and electronic music. Doja also began recording songs on her computer and in 2014 released her debut EP, Purrr! She quickly found herself with a viral hit with the track ""So High"" More singles followed, including the languid ""Nunchucks"" and ""No Police"" each one grabbing attention online. Another single, ""Mooo!"" arrived in 2018 and quickly went viral. On the heels of that success, Doja Cat issued her full-length debut album, Amala, which found her expanding upon her dreamy, meme-friendly sound with more hip-hop-, pop-, and R&B-infused tracks, including ""Candy"" and ""Roll with Us"" In 2019, she issued an expanded version of Amala that added the singles ""Juicy"" and ""Tia Tamera"" featuring Rico Nasty. Her sophomore album, Hot Pink, was quick to follow; with features from Smino, Gucci Mane, and Tyga, the 2019 LP leaned more into the sexually wry aspects of her ever-shifting persona. A Top Ten hit on the Billboard 200, the album's fifth single, ""Say So"" pushed her even further up the charts. After making a steady rise in the Hot 100 at the start of 2020, the multi-platinum track finally hit number one in May, boosted by a Nicki Minaj remix. After picking up a couple of American Music Awards, Doja carried the momentum from her breakout year into 2021. She began appearing alongside established celebrities more frequently, adding a guest feature to Saweetie's single ""Best Friend"" contributing to an Ariana Grande remix with Megan Thee Stallion, and releasing the SZA-assisted single ""Kiss Me More"" All of this led up to the June 2021 release of her third full-length studio album, Planet Her. It featured guest spots from Young Thug, The Weeknd, JID, and others, and its cover art was shot by photographer David LaChapelle. The album, which reached number two on the Billboard 200 and topped the R&B albums chart, also garnered Grammy nominations for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album. In February 2022, Doja hit number 18 on the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart with a cover of Hole's ""Celebrity Skin"" which featured lyrics reworked by her and Courtney Love. That same year, she reached the Top Ten of the Hot 100 with ""Vegas"" her contribution to the soundtrack to director Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic. In June 2023, she debuted the '90s trip-hop-inspired ""Attention"" as the first track released off her fourth studio album, Scarlet. Another song, ""Paint the Town Red"" followed that August as the official first single. Arriving that September, the album found Doja balancing her pop-R&B style with tracks that embraced her rap and hip-hop roots. It featured production by a handful of artists, including Earl on the Beat, D.A. Got That Dope, and Y2K, among others. A Top Five album on both the Billboard 200 and Rap Albums charts, Scarlet also earned several Grammy nominations, including Best Pop Solo Performance for ""Paint the Town Red"" and Best Rap Song for ""Attention"" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Doja+Cat"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Ana Barbara would become a beauty queen before she reached stardom as a singer: in 1988, she became ""Miss San Luis Potosí"", going on to represent her state in the Miss Universe-sponsored Miss Mexico beauty contest. She lost in her bid to become Miss Mexico, however.

In 1993, Ana Bárbara was proclaimed the ""Ambassador of Ranchera Music"", and she also earned the Rostro Bonito de El Heraldo (""El Heraldo's Beautiful Face"") award. In 1994, she signed with Televisa's musical company, Fonovisa. Under the Fonovisa label, she launched her first CD, the self-titled ""Ana Bárbara"". Her song, ""Sacúdeme"" (""Shake Me""), became a hit in Mexico.

Ana Bárbara reached international fame after the death of Mexican-American singer Selena in 1995. When Ana Bárbara's self-titled CD was released to Hispanic listeners in the United States, it was advertised on television as a dedicatory to Selena. A song also named ""Selena"" was added to the CD prior to its American release.

On November 3 of 2005, Ana Bárbara was awarded a Latin Grammy Award.

She is known for her image reinventions and musical versatility. Gaga began performing as a teenager, singing at open mic nights and acting in school plays. She studied at Collaborative Arts Project 21, through the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, before dropping out to pursue a career in music. After Def Jam Recordings canceled her contract, she worked as a songwriter for Sony/ATV Music Publishing, where she signed a joint deal with Interscope Records and KonLive Distribution, in 2007. Gaga had her breakthrough the following year with her debut studio album, The Fame, and its chart-topping singles ""Just Dance"" and ""Poker Face"". The album was later reissued to include the EP The Fame Monster (2009), which yielded the successful singles ""Bad Romance"", ""Telephone"" and ""Alejandro"".

Gaga's five succeeding studio albums all debuted atop the US Billboard 200. Her second full-length album, Born This Way (2011), explored electronic rock and techno-pop and sold more than one million copies in its first week. The title track became the fastest-selling song on the iTunes Store, with over one million downloads in less than a week. Following her EDM-influenced third album, Artpop (2013), and its lead single ""Applause"", Gaga released the jazz album Cheek to Cheek (2014) with Tony Bennett, and the soft rock album Joanne (2016). She ventured into acting, winning awards for her leading roles in the miniseries American Horror Story: Hotel (2015–2016) and the musical film A Star Is Born (2018). Her contributions to the latter's soundtrack, which spawned the chart-topping single ""Shallow"", made her the first woman to win an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award and Grammy Award in one year. Gaga returned to dance-pop with her sixth studio album, Chromatica (2020), which yielded the number-one single ""Rain on Me"". She followed this with her second collaborative album with Bennett, Love for Sale, and a starring role in the biopic House of Gucci, both in 2021.

Having sold an estimated 170 million records, Gaga is one of the world's best-selling music artists and the only female artist to achieve four singles that each sold at least 10 million copies globally. Her accolades include 13 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, 18 MTV Video Music Awards, awards from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Council of Fashion Designers of America, and recognition as Billboard's Artist of the Year (2010) and Woman of the Year (2015).

Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2010 and 2019 and placed her on their All-Time 100 Fashion Icons list. Her philanthropy and activism focus on mental health awareness and LGBTQ+ rights; she has her own non-profit organization, the Born This Way Foundation, which supports the wellness of young people.

67,67,wiz khalifa,3395400,70149407,"Cameron Jibril Thomaz (born September 8, 1987 in Minot, North Dakota), better known by his stage name Wiz Khalifa, is an American rapper based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, signed to Rostrum Records. According to the Black and Yellow Songfacts, his stage name is derived from khalifa, an Arabic word meaning ""successor"", and wisdom. His nickname growing up was ""Wizard"" which was shortened to Wiz when Khalifa was fifteen.

In 2005 he released his first official mixtape, Prince of the City: Welcome to Pistolvania, and later in 2006 he released his first full length street album entitled Show and Prove. Since then he has released a further six mixtapes and a collaboration mixtape titled How Fly with friend Curren$y. He released his debut album, Deal or No Deal, in November of 2009, it reached #1 on the iTunes hip hop chart, and then reached the top ten on iTunes' overall album chart the week it was released. Previously signed to Warner Bros. Records, he left the label in July 2009 after numerous delays in releasing his planned debut album for the label, First Flight. Khalifa stated to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that, ""I learned a lot during my time there and matured as an artist during the process. I'm happy to be moving on with all of my material and having the chance to be in control of my next moves"".He is also the founder of the rap crew Taylor Gang, which includes friends Kev Tha Hustler, Ekko, Smallz Money and Gene Stovall. They derived the name from the fact they always used to wear Chuck Taylor shoes.

Khalifa was born on September 8, 1987 in Minot, North Dakota to a mother and a father serving in the military. The family moved to Pittsburgh when Khalifa was the age of two. His parents' military service caused the family to move on a regular basis. 
Over the next thirteen years, he would move between Pittsburgh and South Carolina, Georgia, Oklahoma, Germany, Japan, and England as his parents were reassigned to different posts. In October of 1990 Wiz was separated from his mother,who left him in the hands of her sister while she served in Operation Desert Storm.

During his travels, Wiz was forced to mature quicker than his peers. He was constantly faced with new surroundings, new schools, and new sets of friends, and he found it difficult to become attached to anyone outside his family roots. This nomadic life gave Wiz an opportunity, though, to broaden his mind and offered him many experiences from which to draw inspiration. He began to perceive the world differently than most kids, and he would write his thoughts down every day.These thoughts would become the foundation for his future recordings.

By the age of 14, with a few songs under his belt, Wiz was already drawing comparisons with his commanding voice and witty wordplay. While he has been influenced by artists such as Jay-Z, Camron, and the Notorious B.I.G., Wiz was determined to create his own identity that would, one day, be loved and revered by fans.

Ready to take the next step, Wiz began his search for a recording studio to record new songs. He found one, ID LABS, where owner Eric Dan immediately recognized Wiz's talents. Along with Chad Glick of ID Management, they began to network Wiz to another Pittsburgh native, Benjy Grinberg of Rostrum Records. Benjy realized the raw talent that Wiz possessed, and immediately brought him into the Rostrum family in 2002.

Soon after, Wiz Khalifa began his ascent into the music scene in the Pittsburgh area. He has been hailed by the award winning Pittsburgh Post-Gazette pop music critic, Ed Masley, as having “the skills, the looks, the confidence, the drive, and the charisma for the job.” The New Pittsburgh Courier says, “The combination of a young, charismatic M.C. with a slew of stop-and-rewind rhymes together with a local independent label with major industry connections has set the stage for a hip-hop artist representing Pittsburgh to reach superstar status for the first time ever.

In 2010, with the success of Kush and Orange Juice still present, Wiz Khalifa signed with Atlantic Records. Wiz's style along with his production team, Johnny Juliano, Sledgren, and E. Dan make this a winning combination for success. 

He is also well known for his debut single for Atlantic, ""Black and Yellow"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. His debut album for the label, Rolling Papers, was released on March 29, 2011. He followed that album with O.N.I.F.C. (abbreviated for mainstream markets from ""Only Nigga In First Class"") on December 4, 2012 which was backed by the singles ""Work Hard, Play Hard"" and ""Remember You"". O.N.I.F.C. debuted at number two with 131,000 in first week sales.

Pittsburgh City Council declared 12-12-12 (December 12, 2012) to be Wiz Khalifa Day in the city. Khalifa graduated from Pittsburgh's Taylor Allderdice High School and in January 2012, purchased a home in nearby Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.

In April 2013, Khalifa revealed that after having his son he decided to work on a new album that he was planning to release in 2013. On April 17, 2013, Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y announced that they will drop their collaboration EP Live in Concert on April 20, 2013. The EP featured seven new songs. On June 24, 2013, he announced that his fifth studio album would be titled Blacc Hollywood and would be released in 2013. On September 3, 2013, Khalifa revealed he had recorded songs with Miley Cyrus, Adele and Juicy J for Blacc Hollywood. In October 2013, Mannie Fresh confirmed that he provided production for the album. On February 11, 2014, Khalifa released Blacc Hollywood's first single titled ""We Dem Boyz"". The album was then supported by the singles ""KK"", ""You and Your Friends"", ""Stayin Out All Night"", ""Promises"" and ""So High"". 

Khalifa released an EP with TY Dolla $ign on March 31, 2015, entitled ""Talk About It In the Morning"". That same month, Wiz released the lead single for the film ""Furious 7"" called ""See You Again"" as a tribute to Paul Walker. The single has since gone on to global success. ""See You Again"" spent 12 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, tying for the longest-running rap number-one hit in the US. 

On January 23, 2015, Khalifa was featured on a remix release of the Fall Out Boy song ""Uma Thurman"". On May 18, they performed the song together on the 2015 Billboard Music Awards show. In the summer of 2015, he began touring the United States with Fall Out Boy and Hoodie Allen in a tour titled ""The Boys of Zummer Tour"". The tour featured performances of ""Uma Thurman"" by Fall Out Boy and Khalifa. Later that year, on December 15, 2015, Wiz released the mixtape ""Cabin Fever 3"". During the Golden Globes on January 10, 2016, Wiz announced that his next album, titled Khalifa, would be released on the 22nd of that month. However, the album was released on February 5, 2016. On May 24, 2016, he released ""Pull Up"", a standalone single in promotion of his sixth album, Rolling Papers 2, which was released on July 13, 2018.

On April 20, 2020, Khalifa released, The Saga of Wiz Khalifa. The album included collaborations with Tyga, Logic, Mustard and Ty Dolla $ign. In May 2020, Khalifa featured on the song ""Drums Drums Drums"" with Travis Barker.

In 2021, Khalifa competed in season five of The Masked Singer as ""Chameleon"". He finished in third place. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Wiz+Khalifa"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
68,68,duke dumont,924238,12483497,"Before 2012 Duke Dumont was known as a ‘producer’s producer’. He was the name on a 12” record the DJ knew to reach for when he wanted to please the crowd, without them knowing who had constructed the mesmerising sonic confection they were dancing to.

In 2012, two EPs on Tiga’s Turbo Recordings (with whom Duke has had a long standing relationship) changed all that. ‘For Club Play Vol. 1 & 2’ offered up sweet ecstatic deep house & UK bass cuts that have united people across the spectrum of music, from early club adopters like Annie Mac, Erol Alkan, Diplo, Martyn and Jackmaster to Fearne Cotton on daytime Radio 1, Trevor Nelson on 1xtra and even podcasts by Tiesto and Avicii. On some nights in Duke’s beloved Fabric London, you would hear the anthemic ‘The Giver’ being played in all three rooms at the same time.

Duke’s early career was mentored by Switch (last sighted producing for Beyoncé) and he made his name as the ‘go-to’ man to remake a pop song for the dance floor (Lily Allen and Bat For Lashes were notable clients). In 2011, he moved out of London to the countryside (Hertfordshire, where his studio overlooks a forest) to focus on his original material.

Synthesizing his influences from techno to UK garage and house he brought back goodies from this zen-like exile. ‘For Club Play Only Vol. 1’ was released in April 2012 on Turbo. With ‘Street Walker’ and ‘Thunderclap’ on there, it alerted the heads to the Duke movement and received support from the likes of Jamie Jones and Simian Mobile Disco.

Remixes for AlunaGeorge and Santigold quickly followed, then in August ‘For Club Play Only Vol.2’ featuring ‘No Money Blues’ and ‘The Giver’ made Duke the man to watch. ‘The producer’s producer’ had become the ‘people’s producer’.

‘Need U (100%)’ features 17 year-old starlet A*M*Eon singing duties. With a chunky low-end, funky stabs and silky vocals this is like an early 90s house classic couched in 2013 techno techniques. In 1988 Inner City would have been jealous of this one.

Co-written by teenage wonder-kid MNEK (who recently sung on Rudimental’s ‘Spoons’ with [artistSyron[/artist]) the Duke released ‘Need U (100%)’ in March 2013 on his newly minted Blasé Boys Club label, where it topped the UK charts for two weeks.

She gained recognition with her lead roles on the Disney television programs Bizaardvark and High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. After signing with Geffen and Interscope Records, Rodrigo released her debut single ""drivers license"" in 2021, which broke various records and became one of the best-selling songs of the year, propelling her to mainstream fame. She followed it up with the singles ""deja vu"" and ""good 4 u"".

Rodrigo's debut studio album,  SOUR, topped the charts globally and was met with widespread critical acclaim. She was nominated in seven categories at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist, Album of the Year for  SOUR, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year for ""drivers license"". Time named her the 2021 Entertainer of the Year and Billboard named her the 2022 Woman of the Year.

Rodrigo signed with Interscope Records and Geffen Records in 2020. She negotiated the record deal to secure for herself ownership of the masters of her music. On January 8, 2021, she released her debut single, ""drivers license"", which she co-wrote with producer Dan Nigro. Within the week of its release, ""drivers license"" was critically acclaimed, and broke Spotify's record twice for most daily streams ever for a non-holiday song with over 15.7 million global streams on January 11 and over 17 million global streams the next day.

SOUR, her debut studio album, was released on May 21, 2021, to critical acclaim. Charlie Gunn of The Forty-Five called it ""the greatest coming-of-age album since early Taylor Swift or Lorde"". Slate's Chris Molanphy said its first three singles alone established Rodrigo's ""early status as Gen-Z's most versatile new artist"". According to Clash critic Robin Murray, Rodrigo is regarded as one of Generation Z's finest artists, while Variety dubbed her ""the Voice of her Generation"" in its cover story of Rodrigo.  SOUR debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and spent a total of five weeks at the spot, becoming the longest-reigning number-one album by a female artist in 2021.

In June 2021, Rodrigo premiered  SOUR Prom, a prom-themed concert film on YouTube. On December 6, 2021, Rodrigo announced a world tour, including tour stops in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Three days later, she was named Entertainer of the Year by Time. In an Instagram post on December 24, 2021, Rodrigo uploaded a snippet of a Christmas song called ""The Bels"" that she wrote and recorded at age five. According to Billboard, Rodrigo closed 2021 as the best-selling singles artist worldwide, placing eight songs on the year-end Global 200 chart, including ""drivers license"" at number four, ""good 4 u"" at number nine, and ""deja vu"" at number 27. In the US and UK,  SOUR was respectively the third and fourth best-selling album of 2021. SOUR and ""drivers license"" were also respectively Spotify's most streamed album and song globally. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) ranked Rodrigo as the tenth best-selling artist of 2021 and SOUR as the second best-selling album of 2021.

On February 17, 2022, Rodrigo announced and released the trailer of her Disney+ documentary film 'Olivia Rodrigo: driving home 2 u', which was released on March 25, 2022.

On June 30, 2023, Rodrigo released the lead single to her sophomore album, ""Vampire."" The single would debut at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and several other countries' music charts, and her record GUTS released on September 8, 2023. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 among other countries' charts, and its singles ""Bad Idea, Right?"" and ""Get Him Back"" debuted in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 — making Rodrigo the first female artist to chart all of her singles in the region. GUTS was nominated for six GRAMMYs — Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, with ""Vampire"" being nominated for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance, and ""Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl"" being nominated for Best Rock Song. The record was promoted through a Tiny Desk contest, RSD exclusive vinyls, among other mediums.

Rodrigo would also release the single ""Can't Catch Me Now"" as the soundtrack song for ""The Hunger Games: Ballads of Songbirds and Snakes,"" which was met with critical acclaim for its lyricism, imagery, and connection to the novel and film. The song was performed at select ""GUTS World Tour"" dates as well as the shows she headlined for iHeartRadio's annual Jingle Ball, which included venues she would later tour on the ""GUTS World Tour,"" such as Los Angeles' Kia Forum and New York City's Madison Square Garden.  

The ""GUTS World Tour"" would kick off on February 23, 2024 in Palm Springs, California, with Chappell Roan as its special guest. The tour was met with virality and critical acclaim for Rodrigo's vocals, stage presence, and visuals — dubbed as one of the most impressive arena tours to date. The tour featured songs from GUTS  SOUR and the  GUTS (spilled) track ""obsessed,"" which was only available on vinyl at the time. On tour, Rodrigo announced GUTS (spilled), a deluxe edition of GUTS which released March 22, 2024 and included five additional tracks. The five tracks debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 — to date, each song in Rodrigo's discography has appeared on the chart.

In April 2024, Rodrigo was a special guest to No Doubt's Coachella performance. The pop star continued her ""GUTS World Tour"" throughout 2024, where she performed six nights in Los Angeles, being the first woman to headline Intuit Dome, and is set to close off the tour internationally in Asia. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Olivia+Rodrigo"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

72,72,forest blakk,198886,1942347,"Growing up in Montreal, with time spent in Florida and Jamaica, the singer/songwriter first took up guitar as a refuge from his chaotic home life, then spent years learning to channel his most complex emotions into song. With his breakthrough single “If You Love Her” —a fall 2020 release that marks his Billboard debut— Blakk has brought his heart-on-sleeve songwriting to a whole new level of resonance, again proving music’s power to transform both audience and artist.
Starkly arranged and deceptively simple, the song unfolds with a raw intensity as Blakk pays tribute to a former partner, infusing every line with his soul-stirring vocals.

With its intricate detail and lucid self-expression, “If You Love Her” reveals the lyrical finesse Blakk first cultivated by writing poems as a kid. At age 15, he began exploring his musical side by learning to play a guitar given to him by his grandmother. By that point, Blakk had endured a lifetime’s worth of trouble: born in Montreal, he spent much of his childhood with his mother (who struggled with addiction) and his stepfather (a notorious drug dealer), moving around constantly and finding himself on and off the streets after his stepdad went to prison. Soon after moving to Calgary at age 21, he formed a band that later earned a JUNO nomination. In the years following the band’s dissolution, Blakk experienced a period of profound change, ultimately embracing the more soulful and folk-leaning sound that defines his music today. One of the first songs embodying that sound, “Love Me” earned attention from heavyweights like Pete Ganbarg (president of A&R at Atlantic Records) and legendary music exec Seymour Stein, paving the way for Blakk’s signing to Atlantic in 2015. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Forest+Blakk"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

82,82,ellie goulding,3340724,125387323,"Ellie Goulding (born Elena Jane Goulding, 30 December 1986 in Hereford, England) is an English singer-songwriter. Having caught the public's attention in 2010 with her singles ""Starry Eyed"" and ""Guns and Horses,"" British vocalist Ellie Goulding quickly rose to the top of the charts with her infectious electronic pop sound. Although she started out writing songs in a folk-inflected style, she eventually grew into a more electronic-influenced artist, touching upon dance music and ambient synth pop. With her unique soprano warble and knack for writing catchy yet emotionally earnest songs, Goulding, much like her predecessors Kate Bush and Imogen Heap, stands at the forefront of contemporary mainstream music and arty, independent-minded pop.

Born in Hereford, England, she later moved to the country's east coast to study drama at the University of Kent. Goulding had developed a love for folk music as a teenager, and her time at university also exposed her to electronica. After two years, she took a break from her studies and moved to West London, where she pursued a career as an alternative singer/songwriter and befriended producers like Starsmith and Frankmusik, who gave her songs an electro-pop twist. In 2009, Goulding began building an audience via the Internet, where early tracks like ""Starry Eyed"" and a cover of Sam Sparro's ""Black & Gold"" were posted on tastemaking MP3 blogs such as Discodust. Goulding soon graduated from the blogosphere to print media, gaining praise from mainstream publications like The Guardian and fielding offers from record labels. She ultimately signed a major-label deal with Polydor Records and began making preparations to release her debut album. In the meantime, she penned songs for Diana Vickers, Gabriella Climi, and others.

During the final weeks of 2009, Goulding topped the BBC's Sound of 2010, a poll conducted by British music critics and industry insiders to identify new talent. Building on that momentum, she released Lights -- a sparkling debut album that splashed Goulding's vocal flutter across a landscape of acoustic and synthesized instruments -- in March 2010. Lights topped the U.K. charts during its first week and spun off ""Starry Eyed"" as a Top Five single (it also charted well in Ireland and New Zealand). Later that year, the album was re-released as Bright Lights, featuring seven new recordings (including a cover of Elton John's ""Your Song,"" which peaked at number two).

In 2012, Goulding returned with her sophomore album, Halcyon, which showcased an even more sonically adventurous, electro-pop-infused sound. In 2013, a deluxe reissue featuring ten extra songs was released; entitled Halcyon Days, it acted as a supplement to the original release. Two of its new songs, ""Burn"" and ""How Long Will I Love You,"" were among her biggest hits. The following year, she was featured on Calvin Harris' Top Ten U.K. hit ""Outside,"" participated in Band Aid 30's update of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?,"" and entered the U.K. Top Ten once more with ""Beating Heart,"" a song released on the soundtrack for Divergent. Another soundtrack single, ""Love Me Like You Do,"" added to the success of Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015.

That same year, Goulding released her third studio album, Delirium, which featured collaborations with Max Martin, Greg Kurstin, and others. The pop-leaning Delirium included the single ""On My Mind"" and peaked at number three on the U.S. and U.K. charts. Goulding returned in 2017 on ""First Time,"" a collaboration with electronic producer Kygo.

In 2018, Goulding joined Tap Management after almost a decade with First Access Management.[107] She appeared on a collaboration with Sean Paul on his Mad Love the Prequel EP titled ""Bad Love"", released on 29 June 2018.[108]

Goulding collaborated with Diplo and Swae Lee on the single ""Close to Me"", which was released on 24 October 2018.[109] On 1 January 2019, The Guardian reported that she has been working on her fourth album, set to release in the same year.[110] On 1 March, she released the next single ""Flux"".[111] She said regarding the album, ""It's very much written by me"".[112]

On 12 April 2019, Goulding released the single ""Sixteen"".[113] Goulding said of the single, ""...That age was such a pivotal year for me in many ways and this song is so close to my heart.

91,91,voilà,176315,5010616,
92,92,alejandro fernández,387474,6476354,"Artista mexicano, hijo de Vicente Fernández. Excelente interprete de rancheras y musica melódica latina.
Comenzó interpretando temas con mariachi y música tradicional mexicana. Últimamente canta también música pop.

Alejandro Fernández (born April 24, 1971) is a popular Latin Grammy-winning Mexican singer nicknamed as ""El Potrillo"" (""The Little Colt"") by the media and his fans. ] Alejandro originally specialized in traditional, earthy forms of Mexican folk and country music, such as mariachi and ranchera. However, his more recent work has focused on mainstream pop music. He is the son of Vicente Fernández, also a popular Mexican country singer. His nickname ""El Potrillo"" (The Little Colt) was given to him by the media and his fans because of his being the son of Vicente, who is considered the most popular charro in Mexico.


Career

Born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, he trained as an architect but turned to singing in 1991, encouraged by his father. A year later, he released his first album, titled Alejandro Fernandez. Since then, he has recorded 18 albums and sold a reported 15 million records, working with producers such as Emilio Estefan, Jr. and Kike Santander. His first public appearance was in 1976, when his father presented him on one of his shows, he was meant to perform the song ""Alejandra"". In the middle of the song he forgot the lyrics, started crying and suffered a panic attack, but then, his father got on stage and helped him singing along the song, making it a very touching moment between Alejandro and his father.

In 1992, Alejandro Fernández released his debut, self-titled album, launching one of the most prolific, successful and memorable careers in Latin music. Since then, the son of legendary ranchera singer Vicente Fernández has done what few progeny of famous parents have ever been able to achieve: He’s followed in his father’s footsteps, but at the same time, he’s carved out his own, separate path, thanks to his skilled vocals and an unparalleled stage presence. Fernández also has portrayed the lead role in zapata: El sueño del héroe, a 2004 movie about the Mexican revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata by filmmaker Alfonso Arau, which proved to be one of the greatest disappointments in the Nuevo Cine Mexicano era, spending 7 million dollars in production and publicity but faring poorly at the box office.

While most Latin acts talk about crossovers from Spanish to English, Alejandro is one of only a handful of artists that have managed to become a superstar by crossing over from the world of traditional ranchera music to the world of pop. That duality began in 1997 with Me Estoy Enamorando, a collaboration with producer Emilio Estefan that sold 3 million copies worldwide and established Alejandro as an international star. In 1998, Alejandro performed along with the operatic tenor Placido Domingo and the French singer Patricia Kaas in Christmas in Vienna VI.

In 2004, A Corazón Abierto reunites Alejandro with Grammy-winning producer and songwriter Kike Santander, who penned his greatest hits from ""Me Estoy Enamorando"". But it also finds him singing the songs of a bold new generation of songwriters, including Gian Marco, Leonel García (one half of pop duo Sin Bandera), Reyli Barba (former member of pop band Elefante) and Mexican group Tres De Copas.

""A Corazón Abierto"" is about love, but it’s hardly a staid album. Quite the opposite. Under the guidance of producers Kike Santander and Aureo Baqueiro, the sound of this record is taken beyond the traditional and is an album rich in instrumentation—rippling guitars, flowing strings and mariachi lines—that treads on folk, rock and ranchera elements with organic ease and conviction. The superb emotional and musical interpretations are the clincher. At times exuberant, ""A Corazón Abierto"" can also be an album of subtle understatement, unafraid to bare the singer in every sense of the word.

""Romanticism is something that will never die"", says Alejandro Fernández, explaining his choice of songs on ""A Corazón Abierto"", his breakthrough recording about lost love, love that is never forgotten and the capacity to always love again. ""I’m super, ultra passionate. We’re releasing an album that’s an x-ray of myself. That’s why it’s titled ""A Corazón Abierto"". It was something very honest. Not naked, but something deeper than that"".

In 2005, Alejandro launches México - Madrid: En Directo Y Sin Escalas (in English: Mexico - Madrid: Nonstop). Featuring 13 tracks including one new song, this album is Fernández at his best - live and in concert! ""Produced by Aureo Baquiero and filmed in front of a live audience at Spain’s Palacio de Congresos IFEMA, the production features Fernández performing some of his biggest hits accompanied by a 28-piece orchestra and some of Spain’s most important voices on three of the songs: Amaia from La Oreja de Van Gogh joins him on ""Me dediqué a perderte""; Malú duets with him on ""Contigo aprendí"", and with flamenco star Diego El Cigala perform a moving version of ""Como quien pierde una estrella"", accompanied on cajon by famed Flamenco guitarist Niño Josele. That same year, Alejandro was chosen to sing along with the tenors Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo in a special concerto celebrating the opening of the ""Forum Internacional de las Culturas"" in Monterrey. Alejandro's performance was praised by the audience. He also recorded a duet song with the tenor Mario Frangoulis called ""Hay Más"" from the album Follow Your Heart.

In 2007, launches Viento A Favor features tunes written by Leonel García and Noel Schajris (better known as emotive Latin-pop duo Sin Bandera) and Mexican singer Reyli Barba. They're all taken to wuthering heights by Fernandez's stellar vocal range, which goes from hushed whispers to booming intensity. First single ""Te Voy A Perder"" is an epic romance, and ""Amor Gitano"", a duet with performer Beyoncé Knowles. Closing tune ""Cuando Estamos Juntos"" is another surprise, an acoustic-flavored ode to simple joy.

He has five children, (Alejandro, Jr. and the twins, América and Camila) with his ex-wife, Mexican América Guinart, and two (Emiliano and Valentina) with his now ex-girlfriend, Colombian model Ximena Díaz.

102,102,the neighbourhood,3214820,281608725,"The Neighbourhood is an American alternative rock/dark pop band that formed in Newbury Park, California, USA in August 2011. The band consists of Jesse Rutherford, Jeremy Freedman, Zach Abels, and Mikey Margott. Brandon Fried (drums) was kicked out of the band on November 15 2022 after groping allegations. Bryan Sammis (drums) left the group in January 2014.

The band released their first EP, I'm Sorry... in January 2013, where their single Sweater Weather reached #1 in the U.S. Alternative Tracks and #8 on the U.S. Rock Tracks and #33 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also charted at #68 in Canada. Their first album, I Love You. was released on April 23, 2013. 

In early 2012 a mysterious band appeared online. The group, The Neighbourhood, revealed no biographical information, no photos and no backstory, offering only a moody track titled ""Female Robbery."" Fans and the press were confounded, scouring the Internet for any information that might lead them to the identity of these musicians. Pieces of the puzzle, some reflecting reality and some not so much, began to emerge. The Neighbourhood were a quintet. They were from California despite the British spelling of their name. They had a second track, ""Sweater Weather,"" which had an accompanying -- and equally dark -- video.

Although The Neighbourhood's identity remained hazy, it became clear that the music they were making felt transformative to critics and fans alike. The evocative combination of rock instruments with R&B and hip-hop aesthetics seemed, in many ways, revelatory, a reimagining of sounds that seemed to make people clamour for more information with even greater fervour. In April, BBC Radio One DJ Zane Lowe, an early champion of the group, let it slip that The Neighbourhood was the handiwork of musician Jesse Rutherford, a resident of Newbury Park, CA. By early May, as the band unveiled a free, self-released EP titled ""I'm Sorry,"" it became understood that the identity of this young band was, ultimately, secondary to the music itself.

So who is The Neighbourhood? In essence, the group, which was formed in August 2011, is a collection of five friends who make music together. They're headed by Rutherford, a 21-year-old singer who has dabbled in various genres, including hip-hop, before crafting the merge of sounds that categorizes The Neighbourhood's style. Their debut EP was produced by Justyn Pilbrow, who brought Emile Haynie on board to collaborate on ""Female Robbery."" The EP, recorded at the end of last year, is composed of shadowy, emotional music with visuals to match. And it's all part of the band's master plan.

""I always have a strong vision before I go into anything,"" Rutherford says. ""I don't know how to make music any other way. It was all in my head, and that vision for the music was to make hip-hop beats with guitars and I was going to sing and rap over them. We wanted to do that hip-hop aesthetic on an indie platform.""

""I'm Sorry,"" a five-song disc, is a precursor to the band's debut album, which is also being produced by Pilbrow and Haynie. The album, expected out in March 2013, will expand the group's moody sensibility, which pairs brooding layers of instrumentals with Rutherford's hip-hop-inspired croon. The style, which the band has dubbed ""black and white"" due to its confident inspirations, is based largely on rhythm, as evidenced by the EP. ""When I started in music I started doing drums and then I started doing vocals,"" Rutherford explains. ""And then I combined the two together because to me rapping is just rhythmic vocals. I think the rhythm of hip-hop is really what got me into it. It's not just words being said; it's about how the words are said.""

In the end, all you need to know about The Neighbourhood is in that music and in those words. There are more facts, more pieces of the puzzle, more information to unveil. But what's the fun in being given the full picture when you can slowly discover it for yourself? It's better to leave some mystery lingering. Because, after all, it's that unknowing that brought The Neighbourhood to people's attention to begin with. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Neighbourhood"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

106,106,stellar,379723,7837274,"There are multiple artists named Stellar:

1. Stellar (스텔라)  was a South Korean girl group whose final lineup was composed of Minhee, Hyoeun, Soyoung and Youngheun. Formed in 2011 by The Entertainment Pascal, the group attracted attention as they were initially produced by Eric Mun of the boy band Shinhwa (신화). Following an unsuccessful debut with the single ""Rocket Girl"" in August 2011, Stellar underwent a line-up change and released ""UFO"" in February 2012, which fared similarly. The group began working with the production team MonoTree in July 2013 and released ""Study"", which experienced modest success and became their first single to chart in the top 100 of the Gaon Digital Chart.

Stellar gained notoriety in February 2014, when they adopted a more ""provocative"" image for the release of their first extended play Marionette. The album's title track peaked at number thirty-five on the Gaon Digital Chart, making it their most commercially successful single. This stylistic change in direction would be maintained in Stellar's subsequent releases ""Vibrato"" in 2015 and their second extended play Sting in 2016. With the addition of new member Soyoung, the group released their third and last extended play Stellar Into the World and its title track ""Archangels of the Sephiroth"" on June 27, 2017. On February 25, 2018, the group announced their disbandment in a fan-meeting after deciding to not renew their contracts with their agency.

2. Stellar is  from a small town outside of Lowell, Massachusetts. His career launched on August 6th, 2019 with the release of his debut mixtape Bipolar. Almost a year later Stellar established himself as an upcoming artist with the release of his breakout Dark Pop single 'Ashes'. Stellar represents the city of Boston, trying to further the prominence of the city's sound in Hip Hop, R&B, and Pop. Some of Stellar's major influences range from the late rapper Juice WRLD, to the highly coveted pop band Maroon 5.

3. Stellar is a band formed in 1995 in Rio de JaneiroBrazil with the end of the bands: Second Come, Drivellers and Stellarblast. The band members are: Fábio Leopoldino (ex-Second Come), Beatriz Lamego (ex-Drivellers), Cadu (ex-Drivellers) and Leandro Ferreira. They recorded their first demo “Thrumming Soothingly” in this year.
In 1997 Leandro leaves the band and Sol Moras (ex-Swallow 5) join the band in his place. They decided to record some new music and from that, ""Transmigrations"", their second demo was launched.
Their first full album, ""Ultramar"", was launched in 1999. In 2000 the band reunited to make their fourth show in six years. From the rehearsal for this show the band recorded their last album, ""4"". Today, 2007, some of the members are playing in shows with the band Pelvs. Official site: http://mmrecords.com.br/200705/stellar/

4. Stellar* is a band from New Zealand. In 1992, musicians Boh Runga and Andrew Maclaren moved to Auckland from Christchurch. Eventually with other musicians, initially guitarist Joel Haines they formed Stellar* in 1994. Originally a three piece they wrote their fist single Ride. This featured in a short film Headlong by Simon Raby. The band in its initial form didn't last. Later Runga and Maclaren came across bass player Kurt Shanks and reformed the band as a four piece.
In 1998 the band signed on with Sony BMG music NZ, later that year they released their first commecial single What You Do (Bastard). 1999 saw their first album release Mix, then the second-highest selling NZ album ever. The album was produced by ex-Thompson Twins singer Tom Bailey.
Mix would go on to gain Stellar* numorous accolades at New Zealand's 2000 Tui awards. It was also released in Australia, and resulted in Stellar* being a tour support for Alanis Morissette (who they got along well with) and Garbage (who they did not get along with, owing to similarities between the two bands). An extended version of Mix was also released, which featured a CD-ROM of three of their music videos.
In 2001 a follow-up album was released, Magic Line, a far more pop-rock based album than their first. After the release of a few singles from it, the band took an extended break, which due to different band members solo projects, took five years. Finally, 2006 bore release of their third album Something like Strangers.

5. Stellar began life in 1995. The origins of the band lay with Ronan O'Hanlon and Martin Carroll who had been writing and recording together since 1991, developing their songwriting, and recording demos. They moved to Liverpool in 1995, by which time Sarah Mason (vocals), Graham Tonks (bass) and Shane Johnson (keyboards) had joined the band. A demo was sent to 4AD, who responded positively and signed Stellar for a one-off deal with Detox Artifacts where they released a 4-track CD. Stellar played the launch party for Detox at Disgracelands, London in September 1996. The audience included Liz Frazer, and Andrew Weatherall. The CD came out shortly afterwards. Stellar continued for another year, gigging up North at venues such as The Hacienda, Night and Day in Manchester and Liverpool Lomax.

114,114,ritt momney,509658,6026183,"Jack William Rutter (born October 12, 1999), better known as Ritt Momney, is an American singer-songwriter from Salt Lake City, Utah. His stage name is a spoonerism of American politician Mitt Romney, who was the Republican nominee during the 2012 United States presidential election and is currently a United States Senator representing Rutter’s home state of Utah since 2019.

Beginning as an indie rock band comprised of high school friends, the project became a personal outlet for Rutter after his bandmates left on Mormon missions and his girlfriend left for college. In his bedroom, he began writing, recording, and producing his upcoming debut LP, entitled “Her and All of My Friends,” in which Rutter grapples with loss, loneliness, and a drift away from Mormon culture.

Rutter was born on October 12, 1999, in Dallas, Texas. When he was about two years old, his family moved to Salt Lake City, where he currently resides. He grew up in a heavily LDS community, influencing his early musical career. Rutter graduated from East High School in Salt Lake City.

Ritt Momney was previously the name of an indie band formed by Rutter in high school, but he became a solo artist after his bandmates departed to become LDS missionaries.

Rutter recorded a cover version of the song ""Put Your Records On"", which was released on April 24, 2020, originally independently through DistroKid and later re-released through Disruptor Records and Columbia Records. The song became a sleeper hit after gaining popularity on TikTok in September 2020. Domestically, it peaked at number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also charted in the top 40 of 15 countries and peaked in the top 10 in Australia and New Zealand.

116,116,the ronettes,1836861,15104449,"The Ronettes was a girl group of the 1960s from New York City, best known for their work with producer Phil Spector. They consisted of lead singer Veronica Bennett (a.k.a. Ronnie Spector), her sister Estelle Bennett, and their cousin Nedra Talley. Their defining album is ""Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica"" from 1963, and their most famous songs include ""Be My Baby"", ""Baby, I Love You"", ""(The Best Part Of) Breakin' Up"", and ""Walking in the Rain"".

The group's career:
Sisters Estelle (born 1941) and Veronica Bennett (born 1943), and their cousin Nedra Talley (born 1946), began singing together as teenagers in Washington Heights, Manhattan. Encouraged by their grandmother, they entered and won a talent show at the Apollo Theatre in 1959, as The Darling Sisters. Phillip Halikus saw their potential, became their manager, and promoted their early appearances at hops and charity shows.

In 1961, while standing in line at the Peppermint Lounge, they were mistaken for a singing trio that had not arrived and were ushered on stage. After performing Ray Charles' ""What'd I Say"", they were signed to appear regularly there and in Miami. Later that year, they danced in shows staged by disc jockey Murray the K, but, contrary to many sources, did not appear in the 1961 film Twist Around the Clock. They did get a record deal with the Colpix label, and, as Ronnie & the Relatives, released their first single ""I Want a Boy"". They also worked as backing singers for Bobby Rydell, Del Shannon, and Joey Dee & The Starliters. Renamed as The Ronettes, they issued several more singles with Colpix and recorded an album, unissued at the time, but had little early commercial success.

In 1963 they came to the attention of producer Phil Spector, who was looking for a new girl group to assume The Crystals' mantle. He was taken with Ronnie's voice and style, and signed The Ronettes to his Philles label. As Spector's new protégées, they were given a strong image as ""bad girls"", with beehive hairdos, heavy eyeliner, and tight skirts. Their first Philles single was ""Be My Baby"", co-written by Spector with Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, and arranged and produced by Spector. It became a worldwide hit, reaching # 2 on the U.S. pop chart, # 4 on the R&B chart, and # 4 on the UK chart. The follow-up, ""Baby, I Love You"", had an even denser arrangement, featuring Leon Russell on piano, and backing vocals from Darlene Love and Cher, among others. It was slightly less successful, reaching # 24 in the United States and # 11 in the United Kingdom. The Ronettes also featured on Spector's album ""A Christmas Gift for You"".

Early in 1964 The Ronettes toured England with The Rolling Stones and met The Beatles. They continued to have hits with ""(The Best Part Of) Breakin' Up"" (# 39 U.S., # 43 UK), ""Do I Love You?"" (# 34 U.S., # 35 UK), and ""Walking in the Rain"" (# 24 U.S.), which won a Grammy for Best Sound Effects, the only one Spector ever received. However, their LP, ""Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes featuring Veronica"", only reached # 96 and other singles were less successful; musical tastes had moved beyond the girl group sound, and the Ronettes were unable to maintain their relevance. After criss-crossing the United States and Canada as one of the opening acts for the final concert tour of The Beatles, they disbanded at the end of 1966.


Later events:
Estelle Bennett and Nedra Talley each married and, in 1968, Ronnie Bennett married Phil Spector and retired from performance for several years. In 1971, under Spector's direction, Ronnie recorded ""Try Some, Buy Some"" for the Beatles' Apple label. This was her last charting record, reaching # 77 in the spring of 1971.

In 1973, as she and Spector were about to divorce, she returned to performing at Richard Nader's ""Rock and Roll Revival"" show at Madison Square Garden. Her new version of The Ronettes at that time included Denise Edwards and Chip Fields, and they issued two singles on the Buddah label.

In 1988, the original Ronettes sued Spector for nonpayment of royalties. In 2001, a New York court announced a verdict in favor of the Ronettes, ordering Spector to pay nearly three million dollars in back royalties; however, the judgment was later overturned on appeal. On February 11, 2009 Estelle Bennett was found dead at her home in Englewood, New Jersey. She was 67.

Awards and recognition:
The Ronettes were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004.

It was believed that Phil Spector, in his capacity as a member of the Board of Governors, deliberately prevented the Ronettes (and Darlene Love) from being nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, although they had been eligible for a considerable period. The alleged reasons included the acrimonious divorce of Ronnie and Spector, in addition to the group having (unsuccessfully) sued Spector for back royalties. While Spector was awaiting trial on a murder charge and out on $1 million bail, the Ronettes were finally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at the March 12, 2007, induction ceremony held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. Keith Richards, a self-confessed longtime fan, inducted the trio. Ronnie Bennett (Spector) and Nedra Talley performed ""Baby, I Love You,"" ""Walking In the Rain"" and ""Be My Baby."" Estelle Bennett was present to accept her award but did not perform. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Ronettes"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She explained her shift to a solo career: ""I actually got made redundant from my retail job and with that money I bought an RC300 (loop station) and just started to try to figure it all out."" She busked ""up and down the east coast with her synthesizers and loop pedal, she has been building a loyal fanbase and captivating crowds with her genre-diverse style.""

In September 2017, the singer-songwriter travelled to Byron Bay in the Australian state of New South Wales to try busking there. At an early performance, she met Jackson Walkden-Brown who became her manager about a month later. Her busking success led to a greater commitment to a music career. The artist spent 2018 living between Walkden-Brown's home in the Gold Coast hinterland and in her van in Byron Bay, writing music and busking full-time. Later that year she won the Battle of the Buskers at Buskers by the Creek. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tones+And+I"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

124,124,katy perry,6120253,328910221,"Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson, known professionally as Katy Perry (born October 25, 1984 in Santa Barbara, CA) is an American singer, songwriter, and television judge. The story of who was born into a totally Christian environment and who years later would become a pop music star. Muse of those who feel different or excluded, Katy Perry got her first guitar (from the church) at the age of thirteen and dreamed of it, as many young people do. The difference is that she did it. She broke free from the shackles of faith (without ever losing it) and set out to live through songs about her experiences. The result? Aside from Michael Jackson, only she was able to place five songs from the same album at the top of the charts.

 After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name 'Katy Perry' and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.

Perry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, One of the Boys, a pop rock record containing the controversial U.S number one song ""I Kissed a Girl"" and ""Hot n Cold"". Three subsequent albums have topped the U.S. Billboard 200. The disco-influenced Teenage Dream (2010) spawned five chart-topping U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles–""California Gurls"", ""Teenage Dream"", ""Firework"", ""E.T."", and ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"" — a record tying her with Michael Jackson's ""Bad"". Its follow-up record Prism (2013) was inspired by her divorce, and incorporates pop and dance along with themes of self-reflection, everyday life, and relationships. With the music videos for its chart-topping songs ""Roar"" and ""Dark Horse"", Perry became the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on Vevo.  Her 2017 electropop album,  'Witness' featured a political subtext and a theme of liberation. Her sixth studio album 'Smile' followed in 2020.

Perry has nine U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one singles and has received various awards, including four Guinness World Records, five Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award. She has been included in the annual Forbes lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011 to 2019. Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. Perry is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 18 million albums and 125 million singles worldwide. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled ""Katy Perry: Part of Me"" in 2012, and voiced Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs and its sequel in 2013. Her Super Bowl halftime show performance is the most watched in history. Perry also began serving as a judge on American Idol in 2018. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

125,125,andrés cepeda,89698,2068807,"
Andrés Cepeda es uno de los artistas colombianos de mayor reconocimiento a nivel nacional e internacional, sus bellas composiciones lo han consagrado como uno de los cantautores mas versátiles de Latinoamérica.

Andrés Cepeda nació en Bogotá el 7 de julio de 1973; es el menor de una familia de cinco hermanos.
Su talento lo obtuvo desde niño con tan solo 5 años decide comenzar sus estudios musicales tocando el piano, luego en su adolescencia desarrolla el tema de la composición creando un sin numero de canciones que han sido todo un éxito.

El rock determinó sus primeros años de carrera artística la cual inicio en la década de los noventa formando una banda llamada Poligamia que surgió en el colegio Emilio Valenzuela; este grupo bogotano se destaco en la esfera musical por representar a miles de colegiales con canciones que expresaban sentimientos de amor y de rechazo ante diferentes situaciones. Esta nueva propuesta nació gracias a un concurso de Radioactiva que les permitió grabar el primero de cinco discos.

Cuando el grupo decide separarse, Andrés viaja a Estados Unidos a estudiar durante dos años Producción Musical, carrera que le sirvió para participar en los discos de Carolina Sabino y Marbelle. Pero definitivamente su futuro estaba sobre la tarima, así que todo lo aprendido fue usado para la creación de sus propios trabajos discográficos.

Este comienzo fue definitivo en la carrera de Andrés; quien como solista ha contado con la ayuda de sus ex compañeros y amigos, Gustavo Gordillo, Freddy Camelo y Juan Gabriel Turbay, para la producción de sus discos.

El romanticismo de Andrés ya lo había dejado ver en las canciones de Poligamia y queda reafirmado con su primer álbum como solista titulado “Sé Morir” rompe esquemas; ya que pasa de ser un artista que viene de hacer rock, a presentar un disco con mucho de despecho y romanticismo, que salió del alma y en el que este artista pudo exorcizar todas sus tristezas en el amor. Jamás esperó tanto éxito de un compilado autobiográfico de canciones que surgieron en noches de chimenea y bohemia, con sus amigos más cercanos.

“Sé Morir”, es el primer sencillo de este álbum el cual recibió los mejores comentarios de la crítica. Dos temas incluidos en este trabajo discográfico se convirtieron en las canciones más sonadas de 1.999 y 2.000, lo que le merece un doble disco de platino, por ventas superiores a las 100.000 copias.

Después de tan buena acogida, el público esperaba más, y para complacerlo llega “El Carpintero” en el 2001. Segunda producción de Cepeda que mantiene la esencia del primero. Se trata de una mezcla de son, boleros, música cubana y antillana, con letras que también le cantan al amor en todas sus etapas. Las ventas de este segundo álbum superaron al primero y consolidan la presencia del artista en la escena nacional, donde es visto como la figura de mayor proyección internacional.

Luego de consolidar el mercado nacional, Andrés decide grabar su primer DVD hecho totalmente en Colombia, un reto que emprende junto a su amigo Gustavo Gordillo, quien se encarga de la grabación del concierto.

1. LANDy is Adam Goldberg, with the likes of Steven Drozd of Flaming Lips, Aaron Espinoza of Earlimart, a host of others, and often times Goldberg very much alone. LANDy's are songs of love and loss. Renditions of contrition. If you've ever been jilted or are generally antipathetic you'll get a kick out of LANDy! LANDy's debut album, ""Eros and Omissions,"" was recorded in Los Angeles, New York, and Norman, Oklahoma, in studios, living rooms, and truck stops (not really). It began in earnest in 2002 and was completed bombastically in 2008, clocking in with 18 tunes--a little something for everyone. Or a lot of something for someone. It's a Best Of! It's a debut! It's whatever you want it to be! This LANDy is your LANDy, this LANDy is my LANDy. It's the music you've been waiting for...and waiting for... 

2. Landy was a moniker of soul singer, Londell McNeal, who also recorded as Landy McNeal and Landy McNeil. As Landy he released a string of singles in the latter half of the 1960s. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Landy"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

According to early reviews of the album from AP News, ""There’s irony there because these feel like songs both longtime listeners and newer fans will want to belt back to Kahan — not because they’re produced for stadiums or arenas, but because they’re full of nostalgic melodies that will resonate far beyond New England."" Kahan wrote this album during the pandemic which he spent back home in Vermont. Stick Season leans more into the folk genre than the rest of his older music which were more pop sounding.

136,136,dj khaled,2499029,49288287,"Khaled Mohammed Khaled (/ˈkælɪd/; born November 26, 1975),[3] known professionally as DJ Khaled, is an American DJ, record producer, and record executive. Originally a Miami-based radio personality, Khaled has since become known for enlisting high-profile music industry artists to perform on singles and albums, for which he often serves as hype man. His distinctions are his booming voice presence, ""motivational"" abstractions, and numerous catchphrases. While his musical contribution is often questioned, Khaled's role has been described as ""organization, direction, [and] promotion"".[4][5]

Khaled was born in New Orleans to Palestinian immigrant parents. He first gained recognition as a radio host in the 1990s for the radio station 99 Jamz, and translated his popularity by working with Fat Joe's hip hop collective, Terror Squad, as a DJ for their live performances. Following his production credits on the group's material,[6] Khaled enlisted several hip hop artists associated with the group and his native Miami to perform on his debut studio album, Listennn... the Album (2006). His second album, We the Best (2007), spawned the hit single ""I'm So Hood"" (featuring T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross and Plies). His two subsequent releases—We Global (2008) and Victory (2010)—both peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200; the latter was supported by the single ""All I Do Is Win"" (featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross), which received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

His fifth studio album and major label debut, We the Best Forever (2011), saw continued commercial success and brought Khaled to mainstream prominence by spawning his first Billboard Hot 100-top ten single, ""I'm on One"" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross and Lil Wayne). His following three albums—Kiss the Ring (2012), Suffering from Success (2013), and I Changed a Lot (2015)—were released to moderate critical and commercial reception.[7] Throughout 2015 and 2016, Khaled gained wider recognition as a public figure due to his social media activity. This, along with several Internet memes, foresaw the release of his ninth studio album, Major Key (2016), which was met with further critical and commercial success as it debuted atop the Billboard 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.

His tenth album, Grateful (2017), became his second consecutive number-one album and was preceded by the singles ""I'm the One"" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) and ""Wild Thoughts"" (featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller), which peaked at numbers one and two on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. His eleventh album, Father of Asahd (2019), contained the song ""Higher"" (featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend), which won Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards—Khaled's first Grammy Award win. His eponymous twelfth album (2021) and thirteenth album, God Did (2022), both debuted atop the Billboard 200. The latter's title track (featuring Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend and Fridayy) earned three nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance.

Outside of music, Khaled has gained success as a writer, with his book The Keys featuring on the New York Times Best Seller list. He has also performed as an actor for the films Spies in Disguise (2019) and Bad Boys for Life (2020). His record label, We the Best Music Group has distributed his releases since its formation in 2008, though Khaled signed other artists to the imprint including Ace Hood, Kent Jones, Mavado, Flipp Dinero, and Vado, among others. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Khaled"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1) Kim Seok-jin was scouted by Big Hit Entertainment for his looks while walking down the street. At the time Kim was studying acting and had no background in music. On June 13, 2013, Kim made his debut as one of the four vocalists in BTS with their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool. Kim released his first co-produced track, a solo single from the album Wings titled ""Awake"", in 2016. The song peaked at number 31 on the Gaon Music Chart and six on the Billboard World Digital Singles Chart. In December 2016, he released a Christmas version of ""Awake"" on SoundCloud.

Jin is also working on a project where he is planning on releasing a Cantonese album called ""ABC Jin"", where ABC stands for American Born Chinese. The album will be released internationally and ""ABC Jin"" will be rapped in all Cantonese.

Jin's style of rapping consists of strong punchlines, and used this skill in the battles he won. His punchlines hardly ever uses metaphors that require much thought to decipher, and his bars are clean cut and powerful when used in battles. Such battles against Verse, Shells, RK, and his 106 & Park battles are great examples of his style of rapping and battling.

After they went to college in separate states, they broke up, and new music writing stalled. Tenenbaum, the studious one, went to the University of Pennsylvania, where she studied communications and performed with an all-female sketch comedy troupe; Lewin attended Northeastern, where he pursued a music business track, despite having no interest in eventually wasting away at a label. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/MAGDALENA+BAY"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

159,159,piso 21,271455,4678795,"Juan David Castaño (el llanero), David Escobar (Dim), Juan David Huertas (El profe) y Pablo Mejía (Pablito), son los integrantes del grupo que ahora suena en las emisoras de la ciudad de medellin, Piso 21.

El mayor tiene solo 26 años y el menor 21. Son jóvenes, sí, pero ya son conscientes de su éxito y más que un grupo, ellos se consideran una familia, pues lo más importante, antes de cantar, es la unión y la lealtad a su amistad.

Todo comenzó en junio del año 2007 cuando se conocieron en un asado que organizó un amigo que tenían en común. Conversando se dieron cuenta de que los cuatro eran músicos y terminaron cantando hasta las 6 de la mañana.

Días después El Profe buscó a Dim y al Llanero y les propuso formar un grupo, pero Dim dijo que sí con la condición de que también incluyeran a Pablito, quien estaba de viaje en ese momento en Contadora, Panamá.

Fue tanta la emoción y la ansiedad por crear el grupo que inmediatamente llamaron a Pablito a Panamá y el aceptó sin dudarlo.

Paso a paso
Su segundo encuentro, o mejor dicho su primer ensayo, fue en el club house de un amigo del edificio San Mitchel, en el piso 21, desde donde se podía ver la ciudad d medellin completa. Este se convirtió durante varios meses en su ensayadero oficial y era allí donde pasaban noches enteras montando las canciones.

""Durante esas noches soñábamos con que algún día escucharían nuestras composiciones en todas esas casa que veíamos desde allá"", cuenta Dim.

""Y creo que lo estamos logrando, pero ahora la idea es que también nos escuchen en aquellas de las que solo veíamos la luz, arriba en las montañas"", continúa El Profe.

Su nombre
A la hora de pensar en cómo se llamarían, dieron muchas vueltas y hasta lo consultaron con sus familias y sus profesores.

Al principio le buscaron por el lado de sus iniciales o pensaron en jugar un poco con los nombres de David y Pablo, pero luego de intentarlo por muchos lados, se les ocurrió Piso 21, pues fue a esta altura donde realmente conformaron el grupo.

Pero a este nombre también le han encontrado una metáfora, pues según ellos, indica que para arriba es adonde quieren llegar, dando pasos lentos, pero seguros y muy largos.

Precisamente antes de empezar cada concierto, el grupo se reúne para gritar su frase favorita ""Piso 21, vamos pa'arriba papá"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Piso+21"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Before this opportunity, she was a member of her high school band, puffing on her trombone near the back of the orchestra. It was at this point that Savage gazed through the rows of musicians and realized that her destiny is to be positioned in the spotlight; singing in front of the orchestra.

A blossoming star, folks about town in London started to take notice and she was soon performing at local talent shows. Cementing her fate as an infectious musical force Savage went on to sing backup for Mary J. Blige, Chaka Khan, Emma Bunton (Spice Girls), Kelly Clarkson, Blu Cantrell, Andreas Bocelli and has shared the stage with the likes of Sting, 50 Cent, The Black Eyed Peas, Eminem, Robbie Williams, and Destiny’s Child to name a few.

On the business end Tiwa set her own 323 imprint with entrepreneur Tunji ""Tee Billz"" Balogun and currently signed to Sony ATV as a songwriter. Savage will embark on a solo career and will release her debut album in early 2011. She has also collaborated with Chuck Harmony (Rihanna, Mary J. Blige), Warren ""Oak"" Felder (Chris Brown and Jennifer Lopez), and producer So Sick (Da Grin) just to name a few, on her debut. Weaving an eclectic collision of influences on her record, the Nigerian native says her album will blend ""songs in my native language Yoruba and some straight up R&B soulful pop records.""

An avid songwriter since the age of 15, she has recorded with industry heavyweights such as Babyface, The Underdogs (Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears), Brian Kennedy (Jennifer Hudson, Kid Sister) and Red One (Lady Gaga, Kylie Minogue) led to Savage writing hits like Jaicko's ""Oh Yeah,"" which features Snoop Dogg, Kat Deluna's ""Push Push"" featuring Akon and with production by David Guetta, Fantasia's ""Collard Greens & Cornbread,"" from the album Back to Me, records on Letoya Luckett’s upcoming album and with background vocal credits on Whitney Houston’s album “I look to you.”

Although being a songwriter for such prominent artists was a great opportunity and experience, writing for herself has been more rewarding. ""I have political songs like 'Middle Passage,' which is about the struggles of African men in a foreign country,"" says the scholarship recipient and graduate of Berklee College of Music.

167,167,ado,452248,39445542,"There are several artists with this name:

1) Ado (born October 24, 2002 in Tokyo, Japan) is a Japanese singer and Utaite and is often considered to be one of the most promising and popular young singers in Japan. 

In 2014, Ado took an interest in music after the video-sharing website Niconico was released on the Nintendo 3DS. She began watching videos on the small screen of said handheld game console, and was impressed by the cover singers on Niconico who sang without showing their faces. In 2017, she began singing as an utaite on Niconico after uploading a video of herself singing a cover of ""Kimi no taion"" (Your Heat) on January 10, 2017.

In 2020, at the age of 17, she made her debut with the digital single titled Usseewa. The song peaked at number 1 on Billboard Japan Hot 100, Oricon Digital Singles Chart, Oricon Streaming Chart, and Spotify Viral 50 Japan. The music video of the song on her YouTube channel reached 100 million views in 148 days after its release. Reaching 100 million plays on Billboard Japan after 17 weeks from charting-in was the sixth fastest in history and the youngest for a solo singer.

Despite the popularity of her debut song and singles shortly after it, she has always remained anonymous in public and still to this day, her face is still mostly unknown. She has been an Utaite (mostly anonymous cover artists) and a fan of Hatsune Miku and other Vocaloids throughout her life which could be assumed to be a reason why alongside simple privacy reasons. 

2022 is regarded as a very significant year in her career. She released her first two Albums: Kyougen (January 2022) and the album dedicated to One Piece: Film Red (August 2022 / More info down below), getting to create two theme songs for the Live Action Movie, ""Karada Sagashi"" as well as having live performances and other collaborations and events throughout the year. 

In the Summer of 2022, She played a major role in the movie One Piece: Film Red for the very popular anime series One Piece as she released an album dedicated to the movie. The album was a big success and appeared everywhere on domestic musical charts and broke numerous records throughout the process. Notably, every song in the album all individually placed very highly on every Japanese musical chart including Spotify, Billboard and Apple Music. the very latter of which saw her have seven songs take up the top seven spots on August 14th. Impressively, she is the only Japanese Artist in history to occupy all the top 5 spots on a musical chart with songs from the same album. 

In 2023, Ado continued releasing singles, released her third album as well as  the announcement of her first world tour. Notable singles this year include ""Show"" and ""Kura Kura"". The former quickly solidifying itself as one of her most popular songs with the latter being used as the opening song for the anime ""Spy x Family"", becoming her first TV anime opening. 

Her third album, ""Ado's Utattemita Album"" was released in December of 2023 which is a cover album featuring various Vocaloid and J-pop songs, which fans voted on for her to cover.

On April 20, 2024, Ado announced her second studio album, ""Zanmu"". The album released on July 10, 2024, alongside a live CD from her first world tour ""Wish"" recorded at Peacock Theater, California.

2) Adolfo Makuntima Makwiza (aka Ado and  Ado Makuntima) contributed to the African music scene in Toronto for over ten years. In fact, he was the first African-Canadian to found an African musical group there. Although he admitted that it's challenging to live as an artist in Canada, he had won support across the country, mostly from African music lovers seeking another opportunity to put on their dancing shoes.

Despite social, political and economic difficulties in the Democratic Republic of Congo, dance and celebration are central to emotional expression. Thus, it comes as no surprise that Ado knew how to enjoy life and that his music is a reflection of it. The hip-swinging rhythms and electrifying guitar of African rumba and Soukous define his classic Congolese style.

He died on Dec 29th, 2017 of a heart attack.

(G)I-DLE are known to be directly involved in the creation of their music, and have been regarded as one of the most successful South Korean girl groups that do not hail from the ""big three"" record labels.

(G)I-DLE reached significant popularity in a short timeframe, receiving their first-ever music show win on SBS MTV's The Show on May 22, 2018, twenty days after their debut. With only one mini-album and two singles, the group earned several rookie awards at major year-end music award shows, including the Asia Artist Awards, Gaon Chart Music Awards, Genie Music Awards, Golden Disc Awards, Korea Popular Music Awards and Melon Music Awards. As a result, many dubbed (G)I-DLE as the ""monster rookies"" of 2018. Their participation in the League of Legends' virtual girl group project K/DA further increased their popularity globally.

After two more Korean releases, (G)I-DLE made their debut in the Japanese market on July 31,2019. Later that year, the group participated in Mnet's Queendom, a survival show where six groups competed to have the highest charting singles. As the rookies amongst older groups, (G)I-DLE finished in 3rd place.  In early 2020, their first world tour I-Land: Who Am I was announced. Originally planned to span 32 cities around the world, the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and an online concert was held in its place on July 5. Both Miyeon and Soyeon returned to reprise their roles as Ahri and Akali for the K/DA songs  ""THE BADDEST"" and ""MORE"".

On January 11, 2021, (G)I-DLE released  I Burn, which quickly became the best-selling album under Cube Entertainment, surpassing Fiction and Fact by B2ST after 10 years with over 200,000 copies sold. Simultaneously, ""HWAA"" topped domestic charts, achieved 10 music show wins, and was awarded a triple crown. On March 4, Soojin was announced to go on hiatus following bullying accusations.  The group continued to promote, releasing ""Last Dance"" as a collaboration with the platform UNIVERSE on April 29.  

For the remainder of the year, the members focused on solo activities, with Yuqi debuting as a soloist with A Page, and Soyeon making her solo comeback with Windy. Miyeon landed MC, acting, and singing opportunities, Minnie made her debut as an actress in So Not Worth It, while Shuhua participated in the Taiwanese variety program Mr. Player.  On August 14, it was announced that Soojin would officially leave (G)I-DLE, with them to continue as a five-member group.

They made their first performance as five on January 17, 2022 during Expo 2020 in Dubai. On February 24, they announced their first full-length album I Never Die, which was released on March 14 to critical acclaim. ""TOMBOY"" became the group's first chart-topper in South Korea on both the Gaon Digital Chart, the K-pop Hot 100 as well as South Korea's Billboard, where it remained for three weeks straight, which earned the group 167 Perfect All-Kills. ""MY BAG"" additionally became the group's highest charting b-side, peaking at twenty-two on the weekly Gaon Digital Chart, thirty-four on the K-pop Hot 100, and nine on South Korea's Billboard chart. On April 27, Miyeon debuted as a soloist with  My. (G)I-DLE then began their first world tour, Just Me ( )I-dle, starting in South Korea, the United States, Chile, Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan and Singapore.

Since their debut, the group has released nine mini-albums: I Am (2018), I Made (2019), Latata (2019), I Trust (2020), Oh My God (2020),  I Burn (2021), I Love (2022), I feel (2023), and HEAT (2023).

Durk is best known for his involvement in the drill wave that took the music world by storm in the 2010s. He is the founder of his own record label, Only the Family (OTF).

Durk’s early career was, like many drill artists, plagued with legal issues and accusations of violence. These issues eventually led to his shows being canceled.

In 2012, his career took off with the release of “L’s Anthem” and its French Montana-featuring remix. In 2013, he continued his hot streak with “Dis Ain’t What U Want,” a conscious reflection on his perception in the media and throughout his city. In 2015, he released his debut studio album Remember My Name and the viral sensation, “My Beyoncé” with DeJ Loaf.

Between 2016 and 2020, Durk went on to drop several new installments of his series Signed to the Streets and Just Cause Y’all Waited. At the same time, he faced renewed legal challenges stemming from an Atlanta shooting. Regardless of the circumstances, he persisted, gaining yet another viral hit as a feature on Drake’s “Laugh Now Cry Later.” He also gained traction with the Lil Baby and Polo G assisted “3 Headed Goat.”

The scars of violence run deep in Durk’s discography, particularly stemming from the loss of OTF members Nunu (Nuski) and King Von at the hands of gunfire. Both artists are memorialized on his album The Voice, for which a deluxe version was released in 2021. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Durk"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She has since taken the stage at Toronto’s Yonge & Dundas Square for Canada’s Walk Of Fame Festival, and played one high profile event after another, wowing audiences with her heart-wrenching lyrics and magnetic stage presence.

Switching seamlessly between composing songs in English and French, Faouzia follows her well-tuned instinct when songwriting. Her first single “Knock On My Door” found its way onto regular rotation at Canadian radio, and the follow up “My Heart’s Grave” is already seeing adds in both Canada, and her native Morocco. Another accolade that the teen can add to her already impressive résumé is that of an award-winner. In early 2017, Faouzia became the first Canadian in history to win the Grand Prize award for the International Songwriting Competition, besting over 16,000 entries from137 countries, and a few short months later, was awarded the Grand Prize for the Unsigned Only Music Competition (6,000 entries from 90 countries). Faouzia was the first ever teen to win each award.

Influenced by hours spent listening to traditional Arabic music in her parents’ minivan, the songbird’s voice embodies a unique range, taking on subtle trills and stylings that combine effortlessly with contemporary pop hooks or Francophone lyrics.

2008: Debut
IU debuted on a Korean music program called M! Countdown in September 18, 2008.

Half-teacher, half emcee, all hustle. A 12-year rhyme veteran, Philadelphia native and Phoenix transplant, Random speaks to the everyman through creative stories and concepts.

It all started with ""The Call."" Released by RAHM Nation Recordings in 2006 to rave reviews, it helped to establish Ran as one of underground hip-hop's up and comers.

""The Call"" has been utilized in university curriculum and has propelled Random all over country, selling thousands of copies and encouraging young, old, rich and poor alike.

Now you are just as likely to catch Random spitting his clever, poignant rhymes at an anime convention as at an underground Hip-Hop spot. 

Okayplayer called ""Mega Ran"" 'one of the most creative releases this year,' and Random's music has gone on to be profiled by media outlets such as Wired Magazine, IGN, Complex Magazine, Blender Magazine and more.

Random released the conceptual ""The 8th Day,"" on August 8, 2008 featuring guest appearances by Naledge of Kidz in the Hall, LMNO of the Visionaries, MC Frontalot and many more, in addition to competing in the world-famous SCRIBBLE JAM MC Battle and landing a feature story in Blender Magazine.

221,221,anne-marie,1013988,17700326,"Essex, England-born Anne-Marie Nicholson was no stranger to performing by the time her debut EP dropped in 2015, having shared the stage as a 12-year-old with none other than Jessie J in a West End production of Whistle Down the Wind. She also auditioned for Les Misérables without telling her parents, and was offered a part. It was a risk that paid off, as it served to open her parents' eyes to her singing ability. Aside from West End commitments, the intervening years between her days as a child star and the advent of her career as a pop singer were spent becoming a world karate champion no fewer than three times, an art form she credited with teaching her discipline and focus, two essential traits of becoming a successful musician.

After a chance meeting with an aspiring singer/songwriter, she managed to secure some studio time in Elton John's Rocket Studios, and, after hearing what she could do, she was subsequently picked up by Elton's management company Rocket Music. Anne-Marie released a demo in 2013 entitled Summer Girl, which drew some attention to the singer, most notably garnering a fan in Ed Sheeran. Despite the encouraging start to her solo career, things were put on hold to give her more time to develop as an artist.

Having guested on tracks by dubstep supergroup Magnetic Man, London-based garage duo Gorgon City, and progressive house trio Raized by Wolves, Anne-Marie caught the attention of Brit and MOBO award winners Rudimental. She was featured alongside Dizzee Rascal and Will Heard on two tracks from their second album, 2015's We the Generation, and spent two years touring with the band, playing some of the world's biggest stages and best-known festivals.

The summer of that year also saw the release of Anne-Marie's debut EP on Rudimental's then-new record label, Major Tom's. The aptly titled Karate EP featured three tracks and a Chloe Martini remix, and producers Josh Record and Two Inch Punch worked with her on the record. Both the lead single ""Karate,"" a slick fusion of electro-grime and R&B, and the follow-up ""Gemini,"" garnered some very positive reviews and led Anne-Marie to gigging as a solo artist. In early 2016, the single ""Do It Right"" reached the U.K. charts, and several months later ""Alarm"" hit the Top 40 in several charts around the world.

In 2017, Anne-Marie scored a hit single when she featured on Clean Bandit's multi-platinum ""Rockabye"" with Sean Paul. The song topped the charts across Europe and in Australia, breaking into the Top Ten in Canada and the U.S. She followed with the solo singles ""Ciao Adios"" and ""Heavy,"" which both charted in the U.K. and Ireland. Both tracks appeared on her debut full-length, Speak Your Mind, which saw release in April 2018.

1) yama is a Japanese singer. She is known for her blue hair, her signature mask and her soft yet powerful voice, yama is also a member of BIN, along with tomato (illustrator) and T (producer).
2) Yama has many meanings. Yama is the god of Death and Illusion in Tibetan vedism, the Japanese word for mountain, Papiamento for shouting and Sanskrit for ban or prohibition. Now we can add a meaning in Dutch as well: the stoner/doom colossus from Tilburg, home of Roadburn. Yama draws deeply from eastern mysteries, warps them into fuzz driven loudness, and drives them home with riffs and grooves the size of mountains. 

The last two years have seen Yama off to one hell of a start. The Seaquake demo EP got raving reviews from reviewers around the world and quickly sold out twice: first as a self-released demo EP and another run released through Mind Flare Media.After a couple of local shows Yama soon shared the stage with bands like Saint Vitus, Graveyard and Orange Goblin, and performed at the renowned Yellowstock and Freak Valley festivals. 

In 2013, Yama recorded their debut album: ANANTA. Ananta is a showcase of Yama's sound as well as song writing. Delving deep into doom, stoner and grunge, Yama has a taste for heaviness and a feel for the psychedelic. Heavy riffs and grooves to keep your head banging, with twists to keep you on your toes. Songs that get their heart and soul in jam sessions, and their balls by distilling them down to their core. Ananta will be released in 2014.

3) Yamai (ヤマイ), officially known as ""KANAN"", is an utaite well-known for her powerful Megurine Luka-like voice with a distinct huskiness and her ability to balance both high and low notes. Her most popular cover is currently of ""E? Aa, Sou.""Nv with over 3 million views as of September 2014.

Già con I Blume, Brunori Sas sviluppa un percorso personale, riallacciandosi alla pura e semplice canzone all’italiana (Da Gaetano a Graziani, da Ciampi a Santercole), forgiandosi di rimandi provinciali e ricordi sbiaditi.

244,244,freeze corleone,76328,7873474,"Freeze Corleone, pseudonyme de Issa Lorenzo Diakhaté, né le 6 juin 1992 aux Lilas, en Seine-Saint-Denis, est un rappeur, auteur-compositeur-interprète et producteur français. Il est également le fondateur du collectif 667 (Ligue des Ombres, la Secte ou Mangemort Squad) et du CFR (en trio avec Norsacce et Osirus Jack). Il a vécu une partie de sa vie au Canada et habite à Dakar au Sénégal. 

Freeze Corleone est né dans la ville des Lilas en Seine-Saint-Denis (Île-de-France), d'un père sénégalais et d'une mère italienne. Il passe ses premières années à Pantin, puis déménage à Dakar, capitale du Sénégal, où il rencontre les futurs membres de son collectif, le 667, également surnommé la Ligue des Ombres.

Il a également vécu à Montréal, et est influencé par la culture nord-américaine. Il évoque avoir travaillé en 2012 sur le M.I.N à Rungis. 

À la recherche de la daillance, son premier projet, sort le 20 avril 2010. Il est composé de 16 titres, essentiellement ego-trip, avec de nombreuses références aux jeux vidéos, au basket, aux dessins animés et à la science fiction. Il y fait plusieurs dédicaces au Roi Heenok, rappeur québécois au style décalé, avec qui il collaborera 8 ans plus tard, et qu'il invitera sur son l'album LMF en 2020. 

Il utilise beaucoup d'expressions anglaises (et les transforme souvent en français, influencé par le rappeur Roi Heenok) comme « S/O » (« shout out » en anglais) ou encore « lin » qui désigne la lean, boisson codéinée à visée psychotrope, considérée comme une drogue. Il est d'ailleurs un grand amateur de cette boisson, qui l'inspire beaucoup pour ses chansons. Il multiplie également les références aux théories du complot, comme en témoigne le nom de sa mixtape Projet Blue Beam, la prétendue richesse des Juifs ou encore à Adolf Hitler et à l’Allemagne nazie. Il répète souvent l'expression « Killu » qui est un diminutif du projet The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory de Tupac Shakur. Ces références sont présentes dans les titres Sacrifice de Masse Part 1 et 2 en featuring avec Osirus Jack dans lequel il énonce un grand nombre de complots et de scandales de ces cent dernières années comme l'esclavage en Libye (cité également dans le titre Baton Rouge) mais encore la négrophobie, le trafic d'organes, les réseaux pédophiles, etc. Pour Paul Didier, le rap de Freeze Corleone est « totalement politique » et s'exprime au premier degré que ce soit pour parler des victimes de la traite négrières, de son soutien à la famille d’Adama Traoré, de la mémoire de Rosa Parks ou encore pour encourager ceux qui « [cassent] le nez des sculptures ».

Il est aussi proche d'Alkpote et son entourage se compose d'autres rappeurs de la scène underground, tels que Luv Resval, avec qui il a fait un featuring, ainsi que de Savage Toddy, le frère de ce dernier. 

Il collabore beaucoup avec le groupe lyonnais Lyonzon, apparaissant à plusieurs reprises des clips solos de chaque artiste du groupe. En septembre 2018, il sort un clip avec deux membres du 667, Slim C 667 et Doc OVG 667, accompagnés de Mini Gouap, Ashe 22, Gouap, Kpri et Noma, membres de Lyonzon, sur le titre 669. Le nom du groupe lyonnais vient d'ailleurs des membres du groupe 667 qui surnommaient la ville de Lyon Lyonzon quand ils s'y rendaient. Noma et Gouap, rappeurs du collectif Lyonzon, ont révélé plus d'un an plus tard que Freeze Corleone était lui-même le compositeur de la production. 

Desiigner, le premier extrait de LMF (La Menace Fantôme), tourné dans les studios Colors, a atteint la 73e place du top singles réalisé par le syndicat national de l'édition phonographique (SNEP). Après une semaine, la vidéo cumule plus de 1,5 millions de vues sur YouTube, ce qui en fait le clip de Colors le plus vu en une semaine en 2020 (après celui de Denzel Curry) et permet à l’artiste d’étendre sa communauté avant la sortie de LMF. 

Le 11 septembre 2020, Freeze Corleone sort son premier album studio LMF, pour « La Menace Fantôme », porté par le titre Freeze Raël, qui le propulse à la deuxième place des charts français. Trois semaines après sa sortie, il est certifié disque d'or, le premier de la carrière de Freeze Corleone.

À la suite de la sortie de cet album, la Ligue internationale contre le racisme et l'antisémitisme (LICRA) pointe de nombreux propos jugés antisémites dans ses textes notamment son « obsession pour les juifs ». Le 17 septembre 2020, après le signalement fait par le délégué interministériel à la lutte contre le racisme, l'antisémitisme et la haine anti-LGBT Frédéric Potier, le parquet de Paris annonce ouvrir « une enquête portant sur différents clips vidéos et chansons de Freeze Corleone des chefs de provocation à la haine raciale et injure à caractère raciste ». Le 18 septembre 2020, le distributeur Universal annonce cesser sa collaboration avec le rappeur.

En Suisse, en septembre 2020, la coordination intercommunautaire contre l’antisémitisme et la diffamation interpelle les organisateurs du Beat festival à Genève pour lequel le chanteur devait se produire en 2021.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Freeze+Corleone"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 2013, she had her breakthrough when she placed fifth in the Norwegian version of Pop Idol called Idol - Jakten på en superstjerne. 

Growing up in a small town (Berkåk, Norway), Astrid got into music at an early age and at six she started to play the piano. Not long after she was also playing several instruments, in addition to sing and write songs. At the age of 16 she participated in the Norwegian version of Pop Idol in 2013. During her time in the competition, she released her single ""Shattered"" as Astrid Smeplass. The single was written by her, Lars K. Hushoft and Melanie Fontana. ""Shattered"" has been streamed over 5 million times and sold to gold in just one week. It is therefore the most popular single from the last five finalists. Astrid got signed to Playroom Artist after placing as number five in Pop Idol. She released her first single 2AM under her new artist image at the age of 18 on Universal Music. ""2AM"" was released in the USA in 2015. She also released a cover-version of the single FourFiveSeconds which has been doing well on radio in Norway in 2015.

In 2015 she featured the Canadian artist Shawn Mendes on the song Air on his album Handwritten that placed at number 1 in the Billboard 200 chart in April 2015.

Astrid released her track “Hyde” produced by the raging popular Lido (The Weeknd, Alt-J, Bastille, Banks) and co-produced by the Swedish duo Cal Maui & Blisse. The track was premiered on Fader Magazine and represents the first new music from Astrid S since her debut hit single “2AM” and her appearance on Avicii’s July 2015 “Waiting For Love” remix EP.

Astrid won her first MTV EMA award as Best Norwegian Act, got two out of four awards at P3 Gull and was nominated for Best Song (“2AM”) at the Norwegian Grammy Awards.
During the winter, she has been working on finalizing her highly anticipated debut EP, which is due out this spring (May 20). Meanwhile, the latest single, Matoma x Astrid S - “Running Out,” has been picking up traction across the world and has passed 50 million streams on Spotify alone.

264,264,what's up,11200,105290,"Ever since the first Advantage album featured covers of classic Nintendo tunes with the grit and muscle of underground rock, I’ve been hoping they might attempt a record of original compositions in the same vein. Yet for some time now, mirroring the rise of stylized recording techniques, highly melodic contrapuntal works have been out of fashion. There’s a sense in the rock world that, harmonically and melodically at least, everything’s been done; many bands react with musical simplicity alongside textural overload. The newly formed Portland-based group What’s Up?, despite their unfortunate name, succeed in channeling overtly composed songs through a bare, distorted sound, and the results end up relatively fresh by comparison.

Founded by The Advantage’s Robby Moncrieff (who helped produce Dirty Projectors’ Bitte Orca), What’s Up? obviously understand the impact of melodic constructions and seem focused on abstracting notions about complicated rock music through their raw recording style. At various times titled prog, art, and math rock, What’s Up?’s ""genre"" has gone through many makeovers, but its broader definition is always based on two general elements: composition and quality of sound. While a wide variety of composition styles have importantly mingled together during the last century, an album’s production has only recently risen to equal prominence. If Content Imagination had been recorded by some slick neo-prog band’s engineer, it would probably never get past our editor’s mailbox. There is an undeniable — if slightly ambiguous — litmus test between indie press outlets and listeners alike that determines what gets covered, and a band like What’s Up?’s acceptance into the bubble is worth noting.

To put it simply, the quality of a record’s sound plays a large role in determining its credibility. It’s not something I explicitly cheer on, but the notion of timbre, fidelity, and ""style"" being barometers of cool isn’t exactly new. In fact, it has pervaded rock ’n’ roll since its inception; just think of the cultural difference between a clean guitar chord and a heavily distorted one. Which made kids lose their shit in the ’60s? The same concept is now being applied to entire records instead of single instruments. In 2009, if your song appears strained and handmade, it likely connects to a time when lo-fidelity recordings were an artist’s only option. Early records signified purity — less concerned with perfection and perception, and more in tune with the moment at hand. We see value in this sense of authenticity, and a large demographic of young musicians has tried to mimic it, often through pop or folk music. What’s Up? smartly pilfer the aesthetic, presenting their sound as a stylistic choice rather than an act of necessity.

Content Imagination remains charming because most comparable instrumental music is presented either through a compressed, metallic sheen or the prism of video game music. And while What’s Up? are undeniably indebted to 8-bit compositions that came before them, it’s nice to hear an aesthetically-minded band grab the torch. With rock drums and distorted keyboards, they cast off the trappings of chiptune bands — namely nostalgia — and let each song sink or swim based on its own internal logic. Removed from the culture surrounding their music, What’s Up? simply know their way around a melody and how to present it in a relevant way, which counts for a lot these days.

274,274,yoasobi,662236,39557021,"YOASOBI (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese music duo composed of vocaloid music producer Ayase and vocalist Ikura (幾田りら/Lilas Ikuta). The group has released four music videos, all of which are based on short stories posted on Monogatary, a website operated by Sony Music Japan, later also from various novels and book tie-ups.

The name ""YOASOBI"" originates from the Japanese word 夜遊び, meaning ""nightlife"". Ayase, who is a producer of the group said he named it as a wish that he could take on various playful challenges by comparing the appearance of acting as an individual to the appearance of daytime and the appearance of two people acting as YOASOBI as the appearance of the night.

The group has a slogan ""novel into music"" (小説を音楽にする, shōsetsu o ongaku ni suru), , which goes along with their amazing ability to create songs with incredibly meaningful lyrics, especially when it comes to their themes for various anime and games.

2019-2020: Formation and rising up with ""Yoru ni Kakeru""
Both members of YOASOBI had active music careers prior to forming the group. Ayase gained a following on the video hosting site Niconico since his first upload on 24 December 2018, a song titled Sentensei Assault Girl (先天性アサルトガール). On 23 November 2019, he released an EP, Yūrei Tōkyō (幽霊東京), which reached third on iTunes' album chart. Ikuta, performing under the name Rira Ikuta (幾田りら), had already released two EPs: Rerise in 2017 and Jukebox in 2019.

The first song released by the duo was ""Yoru ni Kakeru"", based on Mayo Hoshino's short story ""Thanatos no Yūwaku"" hosted on Monogatary. The music video was released first on 16 November 2019, where it broke 10 million views in five months on YouTube as well as being popular on TikTok. It was subsequently released as a single on 15 December 2019, where it topped the popularity charts on both Spotify and Line Music. More than five months after its release, the single would top the Billboard Japan Hot 100 on 1 June 2020.

Following the success of their first release, on 18 January 2020, YOASOBI released their second single, ""Ano Yume o Nazotte"", this time based on Sōta Ishiki's ""Yume no Shizuku to Hoshi no Hana"". On 20 April 2020, Yoasobi released a teaser for their third single, ""Halzion"", which is based on Shunki Hashizume's ""Soredemo, Happy End"". ""Halzion"" marked the first time that YOASOBI collaborated with a professional novelist, whereas the first two were amateur writers. The single was released as a promotional project by Suntory to advertise their new energy drink named Zone. The single was official released on 11 May 2020.

In the second half of the year, Yoasobi released their fourth song, ""Tabun"", on July 20. The song was based on the short story of the same name by Shinano.[15] Their fifth song, ""Gunjō"" was released September 1. The song collaborated with a manga, Blue Period for Bourbon's Alfort Mini Chocolate advertisement. The song was based on Alfort's television advertisement story text Ao o Mikata ni.[16] On December 18, the duo released their sixth song, ""Haruka"", based on Osamu Suzuki's novel, Tsuki Ōji.[17]

On December 31, 2020, they debuted in 71st NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen and performed ""Yoru ni Kakeru"", which is also their first live performance. 

2021–present: The Book
On January 6, 2021, Yoasobi released their first extended play and first physical release The Book, which included the six previous songs and three new songs, ""Encore"" as a lead single, ""Epilogue"" as an intro, and ""Prologue"" as an outro.[19] The duo also released their seventh song, ""Kaibutsu"", on the same day.[20] The song has been featured as the opening theme song for the second season of the anime television series Beastars.[21] The anime's ending theme song and duo's eighth song, ""Yasashii Suisei"", was released on January 20.[22] Both were released as a double A-side single in physical format on March 24.[23]

On January 20, the duo opened their fan club website ""Club Yoasobi"" (CLUB 夜遊)[24] and announced that they would hold their first concert, Keep Out Theater on February 14[25] at the inside of the building under construction at the former site of Shinjuku Milano for an online audience of 40,000 people.[26]

The duo released the ninth song for the Fuji TV's morning show Mezamashi TV, titled ""Mō Sukoshi Dake"" on May 10, and was based on a novel Meguru, which won the Yoasobi Contest Vol.3 with Mezamashi TV by Chiharu.[27] ""Sangenshoku"", an upcoming tenth song for the advertisement for the NTT Docomo's mobile service Ahamo, was based on a novel RPG by scriptwriter Yūichirō Komikado.[28] It will be released in the early summer of 2021.

Proud natives of Mobile Alabama, Gary Stanton and Charlie Muncaster started Muscadine Bloodline in early 2016. From the first time they took stage, Nashville started talking... so now, with two Billboard charting critically acclaimed EP’s under their belt, it’s no surprise the rest of the music world is quickly catching on. The duo’s reputation for high-energy live experiences has resulted in a schedule full of shows spanning from coast to coast. Charlie’s contemporary vocals complimented by Gary’s harmonies and masterful guitar licks make MB a powerfully refreshing mix of talent, passion and unfiltered authenticity. Infamously undaunted by the big stage, their sound intertwines the brash irreverence of early southern rockers with the seductive quality of 90s country love songs. Captivating hooks heard in songs like “Movin' On” and the aggressively anthemic “WD-40” stand as a testament to MB’s wide ranging music-making capability.

7,7,eminem,6916471,454938914,"Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972 in St. Joseph, MO), known professionally as Eminem (stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is credited with popularizing hip-hop in Middle America and is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. His success is considered to have broken racial barriers to the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as influencing many musical artists. His most successful songs on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 include ""The Real Slim Shady"", ""Without Me"", ""Lose Yourself"", ""Not Afraid"", ""Love the Way You Lie"", ""The Monster"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Houdini"".

After the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2002. After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry with the releases of Relapse (2009) and Recovery (2010), the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2010. He then released the U.S. number-one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018), Music to Be Murdered By (2020), and The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) (2024).

Eminem was also a member of the hip-hop groups New Jacks, Soul Intent, Outsidaz, and D12, and has collaborated with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9"" as the duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem starred in the 2002 musical drama film 8 Mile playing a dramatized version of himself. ""Lose Yourself"", a song from its soundtrack, topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 weeks—the most for a solo rap song—and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making him the first hip-hop artist ever to win the award. He also co-founded Shady Records, which helped launch the careers of artists such as D12, 50 Cent, and Obie Trice, and established his own Sirius XM Radio channel, Shade 45.

Eminem is amongst the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States for the 2000s, placing third for the 2010s. He was the first artist to have ten albums consecutively debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and has had five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits (2005), ""Lose Yourself"", ""Love the Way You Lie"", and ""Not Afraid"" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. Billboard named him the ""Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)"", and Rolling Stone named him one of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"" and ""100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time"". In 2022, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Early life

Marshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah ""Debbie"" (née Nelson). His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him. Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before they separated. His father abandoned his family when Eminem was a year and a half old, and Eminem was raised only by his mother, Debbie, in poverty. He wrote letters to his father, but Debbie said that they all came back marked ""return to sender"".

By the age of twelve, Eminem and his mother shuttled between states, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and mostly living with family members, moved several times and lived in St. Joseph, Savannah, Missouri, Kansas City, Warren, Michigan and Roseville, Michigan before settling in Detroit. For much of his youth, Eminem and his mother lived in a working-class, primarily black, Detroit neighborhood. He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten several times by black youths. His mother had a son named Nathan ""Nate"" Kane Samara.

Eminem frequently fought with his mother, whom a social worker described as having a ""very suspicious, almost paranoid personality"". When he was a child, a bully named D'Angelo Bailey severely injured Eminem's head in an assault, an incident which Eminem later recounted (with comic exaggeration) on the song ""Brain Damage"". Debbie filed a lawsuit against the public school for this in 1982. The suit was dismissed the following year by a Macomb County, Michigan, judge, who said the schools were immune from lawsuits.

Eminem was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic book artist before discovering hip-hop. He heard his first rap song (""Reckless"", featuring Ice-T) on the Breakin' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie's half-brother, Ronnie Polkingharn. His uncle was close to the boy and later became a musical mentor to him. Following Polkingharn's suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking publicly for days and did not attend his funeral.

At age 14, Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names ""Manix"" and ""M&M"", the latter evolving into ""Eminem"". Eminem snuck into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles. On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile Road, considered ""ground zero"" for the Detroit rap scene. Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip-hop audiences. When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable. Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes.

In 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Anne ""Kim"" Scott to stay at their home. Several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott. After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades, 17-year-old Eminem dropped out of Lincoln High School. Although interested in English, Eminem never explored literature, preferring comic books, and he disliked math and social studies. He states that he later received a GED.Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills, one of which was at Little Caesar's Pizza in Warren. He later said she often threw him out of the house anyway, often after taking most of his paycheck. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.

Alter egos

Eminem uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter, including Slim Shady and Ken Kaniff, among others.

Slim Shady is the controversial and rebellious alter ego of Eminem, introduced in his 1997 extended play The Slim Shady EP. Conceived during a period of personal and professional struggle, Slim Shady allowed Eminem to express his darker, more aggressive thoughts through exaggerated and often violent lyrical content. This persona embodies the chaotic, satirical side of Eminem's music, pushing boundaries with provocative, sometimes offensive, themes, which blend fiction and reality. The use of Slim Shady is shown in The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Encore, Relapse, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, Kamikaze, Music to Be Murdered By, and The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce).

Slim Shady's influence on Eminem's career is significant. His shock-value content helped skyrocket the rapper to fame, but also attracted criticism and legal challenges, particularly due to songs like ""'97 Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""Kim"", where he addresses deeply personal and often disturbing subjects, such as family conflicts and imagined violence. Despite the controversy, the Slim Shady character is credited with much of Eminem's early success, but over time, the persona also contributed to the rapper's personal struggles, including substance abuse.

Another character is Ken Kaniff, a gay man who pokes fun at Eminem's songs. Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on The Slim Shady LP, where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem. An argument after the album's release prompted Eminem to use the Kaniff character on The Marshall Mathers LP and later albums (except Encore and Recovery). Aristotle, angry with Eminem's use of his character, released a mixtape in his Kaniff persona ridiculing him.

Acting Career

After small roles in the 2001 film The Wash and as an extra in the 1998 Korn music video for ""Got the Life"" (during which he gave the band a demo tape), Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the semi-autobiographical 2002 film 8 Mile. He said it was a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including ""Lose Yourself"" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running No. 1 hip-hop single in history). Eminem was absent from the ceremony and co-composer Luis Resto accepted the award.

Eminem voiced an aging, corrupt, AAVE-speaking police officer in the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof and guested on the Comedy Central television show Crank Yankers and a Web cartoon, The Slim Shady Show He was signed to star in an unmade film version of Have Gun – Will Travel, and was considered for the role of David Rice in the 2008 film Jumper. Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with Ray Romano, in the 2009 film Funny People. In a 2010 interview with Jonathan Ross, he stated ""You know, I love music so much. This is my passion, this is what I want to do. Not saying that I won't do a movie ever again, but this is me.""

He played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale ""Lose Yourself"" with Christina Aguilera. Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because director Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit. Eminem had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2014 film The Interview. During an interview with the main character, Dave Skylark (James Franco), Eminem satirically comes out as gay.

Books and memoirs

On November 21, 2000, Eminem published Angry Blonde, a non-fiction book featuring a commentary of several of his own songs, along with several previously unpublished photographs.

On October 21, 2008, his autobiography The Way I Am was published. The book was first published on October 21, 2008, by Dutton Adult. It is a collection of Eminem's personal stories, reflections, photographs, original artwork, and original lyric sheets from ""Stan"" and ""The Real Slim Shady"". It details his struggles with poverty, drugs, fame, heartbreak, family and depression, along with stories about his rise to fame and commentary on past controversies. The book is illustrated with never before published photos of Eminem's life. It also contains original drawings, previously unpublished lyric sheets, and other rare memorabilia. The autobiography is named after his 2000 song ""The Way I Am"".

An autobiography of Eminem's mother (My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem) was published the following month, in which Debbie Nelson describes her childhood and adolescence, meeting Eminem's father and her son's rise to (and struggles with) fame.

22,22,don toliver,1782081,138932580,"Caleb Zackery “Don” Toliver (born June 12, 1994), is a rapper, singer, and songwriter from Houston, Texas. Toliver began his musical career in May 2017, releasing the collaborative mixtape Playa Familia with friend and fellow rapper Yungjosh93.

Don Toliver’s solo debut came just a few months later, with the debut singles “I Gotta” and “Diva” dropping in November and December, respectively. The singles quickly caught the ear of Atlantic Records, which signed Toliver to the label in March 2018. Under Atlantic, he released his major-label debut album, Donny Womack.

While working on the tape, Toliver caught the attention of fellow Houston native Travis Scott, who invited the young rapper to Hawaii to work on a song on his then-upcoming third studio album, ASTROWORLD. Eagerly accepting, the sessions landed Toliver a feature on the album’s thirteenth track, “CAN’T SAY” by Travis Scott, as well as inspiring him to record much of the material for Donny Womack.

On August 3, 2018, the same day as Travis released his album, he gave a major cosign to Toliver on Twitter:
Coincidentally, on August 2, 2018, Toliver dropped his own project Donny Womack the day before ASTROWORLD.

Genius caught up with the rising Houston artist just a few days before ASTROWORLD’s release to discuss his relationship with Travis, going to Hawaii for the ASTROWORLD sessions, and his hopes for Donny Womack, as his profile gets a dramatic boost.

When Genius asked him about how he met Travis and his relationship with him, he replied:

""When I first started linking up with Travis, somebody from my camp reached out to somebody in his camp. I sent them music and videos and it got to Travis and he was feeling it. He came back and we were able to link up and vibe.""

In May 2019, he released his single “No Idea”, the lead single of his March 2020 debut studio album, Heaven Or Hell. “No Idea” got its popularity from the viral social media app, TikTok, on all the lip-sync and dance videos on the app.

In December 2019, JACKBOYS (Cactus Jack Records members) and Travis Scott released their compilation album, JACKBOYS. On the album, Toliver has a track, titled “Had Enough” (also on Heaven Or Hell), featuring Quavo and Offset from the hip-hop trio Migos. He was also featured on another track by JACKBOYS and Travis, titled “WHAT TO DO?” from the album. He, Travis, and Luxury Tax provided vocals on another track by JACKBOYS and Sheck Wes, titled “GANG GANG”.

On January 17, 2020, Toliver took another big leap in his career. American rapper Eminem released his eleventh studio album, Music to Be Murdered By, in which Toliver featured on the eighteenth track, “No Regrets”. The song’s producer, D.A. Doman, recruited Toliver to record and sing the chorus at the “last minute”.

On March 13, 2020, Toliver released Heaven Or Hell, his debut studio album through Cactus Jack Records and Atlantic Records. It contains features from Travis Scott, Kaash Paige, Quavo, Offset, and Sheck Wes.

Drake has also won four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, twenty-seven Billboard Music Awards and three Juno Awards. As an entrepreneur, Drake has founded the OVO Sound record label with longtime collaborator 40 in 2012.

Early life
Drake attended both Forest Hill Collegiate Institute (left) and Vaughan Road Academy (right) during high school.
Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practicing Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Drake's mother, Sandra ""Sandi"" Graham (née Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. His parents met after Dennis performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he first interacted with Sandra, who was in attendance. He is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day school, and formally celebrated becoming a Bar Mitzvah in a religious service.

Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Dennis' limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the United States until Drake's early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, however, Dennis would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer. His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song titled ""Drake's Dad"". Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell records, which Drake vehemently denies.

Drake was raised in two Toronto neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end until grade six, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighborhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move, Drake replied, ""[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement; my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.""

He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school. He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighborhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighborhood, Drake described the school as ""not by any means the easiest school to go to."" Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background, and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school. He later graduated in October 2012.

Career - 2001–2005: Degrassi: The Next Generation
At 15, eager to begin as an actor, a high school friend introduced Drake to his father, who was an acting agent. The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks a basketball star who became physically disabled after a classmate shot him. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, ""My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV"". He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, returning for sporadic appearances until his character graduated from school. Overall, Drake appeared in a total of 145 episodes.

2006–2009: Early mixtapes and So Far Gone
Lil Wayne, the founder of Young Money Entertainment, would sign Drake to the label in 2009.
After becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as ""pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it."" The mixtape was released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies. In 2007, he released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single ""Replacement Girl"", featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever-unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with ""Replacement Girl"" being featured on the channel's ""New Joint of the Day"" segment on April 30, 2007. The song also saw Drake sample ""Man of the Year"" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including ""Ransom"", ""Forever"", and a remix to ""Brand New"". Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.

In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles ""Best I Ever Had"" and ""Successful"", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs ""I'm Goin' In"" and ""Fear"". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.

Due to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as ""one of the biggest bidding wars ever"". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album titled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means.

Drake then joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of ""Best I Ever Had"" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He underwent surgery later that year.

2010–2012: Thank Me Later and Take Care
Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.

On March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single ""Over"", which peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, ""Find Your Love"", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[76] The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, ""]Care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image]."" The third single and fourth singles, ""Miss Me"" and ""Fancy"" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.

Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.

It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire on May 8, and he had also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.

Beginning his second effort in fall 2010, Drake announced his intentions to allow for Noah ""40"" Shebib to handle most of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me Later, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and others. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be Take Care. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, ""I didn't get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed many of the songs and sonically I didn't get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round."" Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.

In January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie, to focus on the album. ""Dreams Money Can Buy"" and ""Marvins Room"" were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track listing, while ""Marvins Room"" gained Gold certification by the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio. Drake would soon release the song's music video on June 28.

""Headlines"" was released on August 9, acting as the lead single for Take Care. It was met with positive critical and commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12. It was eventually certified Platinum in both the United States and Canada. The music video for the single was released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game in January 2012. ""Make Me Proud"" was released as the album's second single, on October 16. It was the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number nine the following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88. ""Make Me Proud"" soon became Drake's fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.

Prior to the album's release, Drake had planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne, however, it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne. He had also begun collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled Y.O.L.O., but the duo decided against the project, in favor of increased concern for their respective studio albums.

Take Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. John McDonnell of NME dubbed it ""an affecting masterpiece"" and commended its ""delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive lyrics."" Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal found Drake's ""technical abilities"" to be improved and stated, ""Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up."" Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice called it ""a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West."" Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented the depth of Drake's ""moral psychodramas"" and stated, ""the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying power."" It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial success, eventually being certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the US.

The album's third and fourth singles, ""The Motto"" and Take Care"", were released on November 29, and February 21, 2012 respectively. Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with ""The Motto"" credited for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States. The music video for ""Take Care"" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, ""None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] - make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it."" The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year. The song was also featured on the channel's ""Pop Songs You Must Hear"" list of 2011. ""HYFR"" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified Gold. It would later win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video in 2012, and the channel also ranked him at number two on their ""Hottest MCs in the Game"" list.

In promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip-hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million. He then returned to acting, starring in Ice Age: Continental Drift as Ethan.

2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and commercial mixtapes
During the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer's influence over his next album. Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics prevalent previously.

In January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off of his third album at the conclusion of the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of his third album. The album's second single, ""Hold On, We're Going Home"", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful single off of the album, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song's music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the video. Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing the album's third single, ""Too Much"", alongside featured artist Sampha.

Nothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favorable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in 808s & Heartbreak. The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further promoted by the ""Would You like a Tour?"" throughout late 2013, to early 2014. It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million. Drake then returned to acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night Live, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what ""kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters"". Drake also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city. In late 2014, Drake announced that he had begun recording sessions for his fourth studio album.

In 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the Romeo Santos song Odio. He also appeared on a remix of Tuesday by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard's Rhythmic chart and number twelve on the ""Hot 100"", and released ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"" as a non-album single. The latter went double platinum in the United States.

On February 12, 2015, Drake released If You're Reading This It's Too Late onto iTunes, with no prior announcement. Despite debate on whether it is an album or a mixtape, its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money Records, a scheme that was rumored to allow Drake to leave the label. However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and If You're Reading This It's Too Late sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall. Drake proceeded If You're Reading This It's Too Late with a collaborative mixtape with Future, which was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week.

What a Time to Be Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Drake the first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the same year since 2004. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units. Drake also appeared on the cover of The Fader for their 100th issue.

2016–2017: Views and More Life
Drake announced in January 2016 that his fourth studio album would be launched during the spring, releasing the promotional single ""Summer Sixteen"" later that month. The album was originally titled Views from the six, but would later be shortened to Views. ""Summer Sixteen"" debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip-hop to more tenured artists. This move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as ""goodly brash"" or ""conventionally disrespectful."" It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake popularizing the term ""The Six"" when referencing Toronto. Drake also crashed a Bat Mitzvah in New York City on February 20, performing at the event.

Drake soon released the album's lead singles, ""Pop Style"" and the dancehall-infused ""One Dance"", on April 5. Both debuted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with ""One Dance"" becoming Drake's first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist. The single also became Drake's first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed the album's release date of April 29, and followed it up with various promotional videos. On October 15, ""One Dance"" became Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016.

Views was previewed in London, before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being made available to various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later to release a short film titled Please Forgive Me, starring frequent collaborators, Swedish twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta. As of 2019, Views remains Drake's best-selling album.

Drake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as the show's musical guest. Later, Drake was named as a member of the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury. During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the music video for ""Child's Play"" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics. On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views. At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Drake received the most nominations, with 10, winning the awards for Album of the Year and Best Hip-Hop Video. Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the course of the tour in Europe. Seven additional dates were added a day later due to overwhelming demands.

Soon after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed he would be releasing a project titled More Life in December, however he later pushed the date back to the new year. The project was described as a ""playlist of original music"", rather than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album. He was later revealed to be Spotify's most streamed artist for the second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion streams for all projects on the service, which is more than double the amount of streams he had in 2015. Drake later secured his second and third Grammy Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony. Despite multiple setbacks, Drake announced More Life would be released on March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials released through Instagram. Upon release, More Life received mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200, earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It also set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever streamed album in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music alone. The album also garnered 61.3 million streams on Spotify, dethroning Ed Sheeran's ÷ as the highest opening on the service in a single day. He later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins in a single show. Billboard also reported Drake had been present on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has the most recorded entries by a solo artist.

He then released the single ""Signs"" on June 24, as well as reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset. The singles marked his first releases since More Life, with ""Signs"" was initially released as a collaboration between Drake and French fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the ""Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2018"" fashion show. The event also had a playlist exclusively from OVO Sound, curated by label co-founder Oliver El-Khatib. Drake later hosted the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of Virginia Black. Drake then appeared in The Carter Effect documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince Carter, who was the first superstar player to appear for the Toronto Raptors since the franchise's inception in 1995. The documentary also featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and LeBron James.

2018: Scorpion and return to television
After rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer Pi'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017. Two songs would later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on January 20, 2018, marking Drake's first solo release since More Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring on a remix of the Jay-Z song ""Family Feud"" with Lil Wayne, as the lead single of the latter's Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape. Scary Hours featured the songs ""Diplomatic Immunity"" and ""God's Plan"", which both debuted within the top-ten, with the latter eventually breaking various streaming records as it debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was Drake's second as a solo artist to reach number one.

Drake earned his 70th top 40 hit after featuring on the Migos song ""Walk It Talk It"", which debuted at number eighteen, and peaked at number ten. He later featured on BlocBoy JB's debut single, ""Look Alive"", which was released on February 9, 2018. The song's entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper with the top 10 hits on the Hot 100, with 23. He then featured on a remix to ""Lemon"", a song originally released as collaboration between band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, Drake announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was releasing a single later that night. On April 6, ""Nice for What"" was released, alongside a music video, which featured several female celebrities.

After ""Nice For What"" replaced his own ""God's Plan"" on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace their former number-one debut, Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion, with a planned release date of June 29, 2018. He then released ""I'm Upset"" on May 26, as the album's third single. Scorpion was then released as a double-album, and marked Drake's longest project, with a run-time of just under 90 minutes. The album broke both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it gained 132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming service, respectively. It eventually sold 749,000 album equivalent units in its first week of sales, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.

Shortly thereafter, Drake collaborated with British hip hop promotion Link Up TV on July 7, releasing a freestyle as a part of the promotion's 'Behind Barz' segment, before releasing another freestyle a week later after featuring on Charlie Sloth's long-running Fire in the Booth program on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Drake then earned his sixth number-one hit with ""In My Feelings"" on July 21, which also spawned the viral ""#InMyFeelingsChallenge"" or ""#KiKiChallenge"". The success of ""In My Feelings"" also made Drake the record holder for most number one hits among rappers. Soon after, he released the music video for ""Nonstop"", which was filmed in London during his surprise performance at the Wireless Festival.

He then appeared on the album Astroworld, featuring uncredited vocals for the song ""Sicko Mode"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Drake announced in July 2018 that he planned to ""take 6 months to a year"" to himself in order to produce television and films, including Euphoria. He then began the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour with co-headliners Migos on August 12. This preceded collaboration with Bad Bunny titled ""Mia"", which featured Drake performing in Spanish. He later received the award for Hot Ticket Performer at the 2018 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 16. During a performance in Edmonton on November 7, Drake announced his intention to begin composing his next project in early 2019.

2019–present: Upcoming album
In February 2019, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rap Song, for ""God's Plan"", at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. During his speech, producers abruptly cut to a commercial break, leading viewers to speculate they were censoring his speech during which he criticized The Recording Academy. A legal representative for the Academy then released a statement stating ""a natural pause [led] the producers [to] assume that he was done and cut to commercial,"" and added the organization offered him an opportunity to return to stage, but he declined.

On February 14, Drake re-released his third mixtape, So Far Gone, onto streaming services for the first time to commemorate its 10-year anniversary, and later collaborated with Summer Walker on a remix of Walker's song ""Girls Need Love"", marking his first release of 2019. On April 10, 2019 during a London performance on his Assassination Vacation Tour, the OVO leader told the crowd he was working on his new album before the show. On June 8, Drake appeared on Chris Brown's single ""No Guidance"". On June 15, Drake released two songs, ""Omertà"" and ""Money in the Grave"", on his EP The Best in the World Pack to celebrate the NBA Championship win of the Toronto Raptors. On August 2, he released the compilation album Care Package, consisting of songs released between 2010 and 2016 that were initially unavailable for purchase or commercial streaming; it debuted at number one.

Artistry - influences
Drake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West, Jay Z, and Lil Wayne, while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah, and Usher. Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his ""biggest inspirations"".

Musical style
Drake has credited Kanye West (left) and Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical influences. Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism. His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as ""ting"", ""touching road"", ""talkin' boasy"" and ""gwanin' wassy"". Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip-hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing. He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.

The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional or boastful. However, Drake is often revered for incorporating ""degrading"" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between ""pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata."" Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as ""hyper-reality rap"", which is characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as being distinct from the ""real world.""

Public image
The Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States, with his single, ""The Motto"", which includes, ""You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO."" Drake later popularized the term ""The Six"" in 2015 in relation his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city. Furthermore, the subject matter of his artistry often revolving around relationships, have had widespread impact on social media through photo captions commonly used to reference emotions or personal situations. However, his lyrical contents have had a negative reception from fans and critics deeming him as sensitive; a trait that is understood as being antithetical to hip hop culture. June 10 was declared ""Drake Day"" in Houston, Texas. In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines, in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance. In 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States. He would also donate $200,000 in order to aid relief efforts in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey. In February 2018, following the single ""God's Plan"" debut at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Drake donated $50,000 to a Miami homeless shelter and giving a University of Miami student $50,000 to help with her tuition. Drake then ""kept up the spending spree"" by donating the rest of the song's video budget, $996,631.90, to several charitable causes and regular people across Miami.

The music video for ""Hotline Bling"" went viral, due to Drake's eccentric choices in dancing. The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake's unconventional nature on the song, causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, spawning several parodies. Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exampled by the video for ""Hotline Bling"". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6"" Classic Boots. This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose, in which various items of clothing were produced. Drake had also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the ""Air Jordan OVOs"". Moreover, his style and dress sense have caused GQ magazine to describe him as ""[one of] the most stylish men alive"".

Controversies - legal issues
In 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on ""Marvins Room"". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties. Despite Drake's legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling ""Jimmy Smith Rap"", a 1982 single by jazz musician, Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who stated Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on ""Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2"", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop. Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement. Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics on when collaborating with YG on the song ""Who Do You Love?"". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year. In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.

In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel ""Chubbs"" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also says the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering. The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu, after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference; the judge ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense.

Feuds
Drake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident and released a song criticizing Drake weeks later. Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute.

In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe magazine. Drake would later respond on ""6 God"" and ""6PM in New York"", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment.

Further controversy arose in July 2015, when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during recording sessions for ""RICO"", one of the lead singles off of Mill's second studio album. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller. Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for ""R.I.C.O."". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for ""R.I.C.O."", ""10 Bands"", and ""Know Yourself"". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, titled ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back"", in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with ""Wanna Know"", before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later. Despite subliminal disses from either artist, the feud has not been officially reignited. Drake would further seek to denounce Funkmaster Flex during his Madison Square Garden shows on the Summer Sixteen Tour. Following Meek Mill's sentencing of two to four years for probation violation, Drake stated ""Free Meek Mill"" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on ""Family Feud"". Pusha T would also use the same rationale to criticize Drake on ""Infrared"" in 2018, prompting Drake to respond with the ""Duppy Freestyle"" diss track on May 25. Pusha T would directly respond to the track through ""The Story of Adidon"" on May 29, which presented several claims, including an accusation of Drake fathering a secret child. The pair is considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, with Drake yet to respond to ""The Story of Adidon"".

In 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through ""4PM in Calabasas"", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on ""No Shopping"" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song. However, French Montana claimed that Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake, he has yet to officially respond to Budden. In the same year, Drake mocked Kid Cudi for his mental health, drug use and suicidal urges on ""Two Birds, One Stone"" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter. Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.

In mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator, Kanye West. In an appearance on the talk show The Shop in October, Drake recounted several business meetings with West, who voiced his desire to ""be Quincy Jones"" and work with him, in order to replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson. West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, which was agreed to as Drake ""felt a genuine vibe"" from West, and after West gifted him the beat to ""Lift Yourself"", which inspired Drake to begin writing to the instrumental. West then requested Drake to travel to Wyoming to continue working, and arrived a day after close friend 40. 40 said West was working on an album; contradictory to his previous aim of just wanting to ""give [Drake] beats"". Drake responded by saying West stated he would release in late 2018, and they should continue on. However, upon his arrival in Wyoming, Drake ""[spent] the majority of time working on [West's] music"", only exploring his own after playing the producer the song ""March 14"", which addresses Drake's relationship with his newborn son and co-parent. This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T. West would also release ""Lift Yourself"", and produce ""Infrared""; actions that greatly displeased Drake. This prompted him to denounce West in several songs and live performances. West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018.

Drake has purported to have been in reported feuds with DMX, Kendrick Lamar, Common, The Weeknd, XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez, and Ludacris, although the latter three have been reported to be resolved.

Business ventures - Endorsements
Prior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient. In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger King and Whataburger. Business magazine Forbes commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships ""combined heavily"" for Drake's reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the highest-paid celebrities during that period.

Main article: OVO Sound
During the composition of Nothing Was the Same, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, and business partner, Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the trio to team up to form OVO Sound. The name is an abbreviation derived from the October's Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects. Warner Bros. Records currently distribute the label.

Drake, 40 and PartyNextDoor were the label's inaugural artists. The label houses artists including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, OB O'Brien, Roy Woods, dvsn, Plaza, and Kash Doll, as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Mike Zombie, Nineteen85, and Future the Prince. OVO Sound has released six albums, with two certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Toronto Raptors
On September 30, 2013, at a press conference with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke, Drake was announced as the new ""global ambassador"" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. This would also be the setting where Drake was given The Key to the City. In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities, beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary. He began by hosting an annual ""Drake Night"" segment with the organization, which began in 2013.

Apple Music
Following the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million. This saw all future solo releases by Drake becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers. Drake had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted More Life. Drake's partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform's sharp success, as it attained 10 million subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists, such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services. Through signing with the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before the smartwatch saw public release.

Virginia Black
Two months prior to the release of Views, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based whiskey. This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring's Restaurant in Toronto. The beverage was created and also distributed alongside Proximo Spirits, as well as with Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008. The company described the partnership as ""fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey.""

The product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically. The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music and various tours, such as being part of the ""Virginia Black VIP Lounge"" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016. The company later aired commercials with Dennis Graham, which featured the tagline of ""The Realest Dude Ever"" (in reference toward ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to various European countries in 2017.

Personal life
Drake lives in Hidden Hills, California, since 2012. He also owns a property in Toronto, which was built from the ground-up in 2017, and a Toronto condo adjacent to the CN Tower. He owns a Boeing 767 airplane.

Drake's paternal uncles are bass guitarist Larry Graham and musician Teenie Hodges. Graham achieved both critical and commercial success as a member of the band Sly and the Family Stone, while Hodges featured as the lead guitarist and songwriter for Al Green, and contributed heavily on much of his work in the 1970s, including the hits ""Take Me to the River"", ""Love and Happiness"", and ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"".

Drake is a father to one son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French artist Sophie Brussaux. Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumors after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017; Drake eventually confirmed his fatherhood on the album Scorpion in 2018.

Drake dated singer Rihanna off-and-on from 2009 to 2016. He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums, and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said ""she's a woman I've been in love with since I was 22 years old."" On becoming a single parent, he mused on the talk show The Shop:

As life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don't have the fairy tale, like, 'Oh, Drake started a family with Rihanna and this is like so perfect.' It looks so good on paper. By the way, I wanted that too at one time.

26,26,kaze,32253,921397,"There are several artists named Kaze:

1. A Free Jazz Group
2. A Japanese R&B pop vocalist
3. Kevin “Kaze” Thomas
4. A Spanish rapper

1. 
Natsuki Tamura – trumpet
Christian Pruvost - trumpet
Satoko Fujii – piano
Peter Orins– drums

Formed only seven months before their remarkable debut recording Rafale, Kaze brings together trumpeter Natsuki Tamura and pianist Satoko Fujii, two of Japan's foremost improviser-composers, with trumpeter Christian Pruvost and drummer Peter Orins from the French improvisers collective, Muzzix.
The members of this international quartet share an insatiable appetite for sonic experimentation, boundless energy and enthusiasm, and the disciplined intelligence of accomplished spontaneous composers. Melodic, abstract, mysterious, beautiful, and confrontational, Kaze plays free jazz at its most creative and powerful.

2. Kaze debuted as a solo artist from the record label D-topia with the digital single ""Zurukare"" in 2011, in addition to featuring on several compilation albums. 

3. Kevin “Kaze” Thomas is a versatile artist-producer who captures the spirit of groundbreakers like Run-DMC, Snoop Dog, and Wu-Tang Clan to promote an on-going, innovative hip-hop culture. Hailing from northern Virginia and eastern North Carolina, Kaze grew up in the 80’s memorizing his big sister’s mix tapes of hip-hop legends to lift himself out of an oppressive country lifestyle. As a student in communications at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, Kaze helped to create Hip-Hop Nation, an on-campus organization fostering the growth of local emcees, poets, DJs, dancers, and graffiti artists. His mission gained national attention in 2001 when Kaze was tapped to co-create, produce, and host the nationally syndicated television program titled Hip-Hop Nation: Notes from the Underground. The show captured the immensity of the culture’s influence with viewers in over a hundred markets and linked Kaze’s name with a movement of international interest.

Kaze’s production experiences led to the establishment of his own record label, Soul Dojo, Inc. The initial offering under that label is his Spirit of ’94, a tribute to the legends of hip-hop featuring 15 tracks he both wrote and produced. Ingenuity and originality characterize his rhymes, while his words promote political consciousness, address personal trials, and celebrate the passion of hip-hop. The March 2003 release of Spirit of ‘94 set the standard for the label, claiming much critical acclaim and winning fans across the state. After selling thousands of copies independently, both on the streets and through mom and pop record stores, Spirit of ’94 was picked up by BCD Global Distribution in October of 2003 for placement into Transworld operated record stores such as FYE. The single, “50/50 Amp”, has received airplay on college and commercial radio stations across the country, charting with Billboard and with CMJ. Kaze peaked at number 11 on the Rap Network in March of 2004, a chart tabulated by spins from the tastemakers of college radio.

Kaze’s April 2004 sophomore effort, titled Enemy of the State, is a mixtape which features a collection of tracks by North Carolina’s finest hip-hop artists and producers. With notable appearances by Nature and 9th Wonder among others, Kaze uses the album as a platform for voicing his desire to make it to the top of the industry and chronicles his success and struggle thus far. Kaze’s first single from Enemy of the State titled “On” is due to grow on the strength of his debut and aims for an even greater audience.

Kaze has become one of the most talked about and recognizable figures in the North Carolina music scene. With strong personality and a unique style, he reigns as a tested mic battle champion and regularly lights up stages at nationally known venues across the Southeast including the Smith Center, Gusman Theater, Cat’s Cradle, Echo Lounge, Local 506, Apache Cafe, and The Brewery. He has opened for such artists as Nas, Jurassic 5, KRS-One Dead Prez, The Arsonists, Swollen Members, and Camp Lo. He also can be heard working the crowds for Soul Dojo’s premier open mic night, Microphone Mondays, at Rolling Stone Magazine’s favorite Chapel Hill music venue, the Local 506.

4. Cristian, a.k.a Kaze is a rapper from Cartagena, Spain. He released his first album, No Encajes, in 2016.

28,28,black eyed peas,5209628,122077643,"Black Eyed Peas is an American hip hop/pop group formed in Los Angeles in 1995. The group's current line-up consists of will.i.am, Taboo and apl.de.ap. Black Eyed Peas have so-far sold an estimated 56 million albums and singles worldwide.

Black Eyed Peas went to centenary state high school and got their start in 1988 when will.i.am (born 1975 William James Adams Jr.) and apl.de.ap (born 1974 Allan Pineda) began rapping and performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to Ruthless Records (run by Eazy-E) after catching the attention of the nephew of Jerry Heller (Eazy-E's manager). Along with Mookie Mook (Burning Star), Dante Santiago & DJ Motiv8, they called their group A.T.B.A.N. Klann. Their debut album, 'Grass Roots', was not released originally because Ruthless did not consider the social themes reflected in the group's music to be marketable to their audience. A single ""Puddles of H2O"" was released in 1994 but no album was released (until it leaked onto the Internet in the mid 2000s). 

After Eazy-E died of an AIDS related illness in 1995, they changed their name to Black Eyed Peas; will.i.am explained on the front cover of the Monkey Business album that ""Black Eyed Peas are food for the soul"", hence the name. will.i.am has cited the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an influence and said he named his band after a food, like them. They replaced their original third member Mookie, with Dante Santiago the Peas original singer. Then Taboo (born Jaime Gomez) joined the group. Dante Santiago took on a role as a guest vocalist in the band and featured frequently on various tracks for their first four albums. 

In 1996, they produced and appeared on a song entitled ""That's Right"" for Brian Austin Green's hip-hop album One Stop Carnival. Later, they began using Kim Hill as a steady background singer. Unlike many hip-hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a musical and clothing style that differed wildly from the ""gangsta rap"" sounds of other Los Angeles-based hip-hop acts at the time. Through the mid-'90s, they performed in the local club circuit alongside fellow acts such as Ozomatli and Jurassic 5.

The group were signed to Interscope Records and released their debut, ""Behind the Front"", in 1998. The album won the group (and their accompanying live band, the Bucky Jonsons) critical acclaim. The album featured the single ""Joints & Jams"", which was included on the Bulworth soundtrack. Their second album, ""Bridging the Gap"", was released in 2000; it featured the single ""Request + Line"" featuring Macy Gray.

After replacing their female background singer with Fergie, the group released their breakout album, ""Elephunk"", and their 2005 album, ""Monkey Business"", which featured the hit singles ""Pump It"", ""Don't Phunk With My Heart"", ""Don't Lie"" and ""My Humps"".

""The E.N.D. (The Energy Never Dies)"", their fifth album, was released worldwide in June 2009 and has managed to sell 5 million copies in 8 months (Elephunk: 7 million, Monkey Business: 10 million). It already spawned 2 of the most downloaded singles of all time: ""Boom Boom Pow"" and ""I Gotta Feeling"", both were downloaded 5 million times only in the USA. The 3rd single ""Meet Me Halfway"" was downloaded 2 million times and the 4th ""Imma Be"", which was just released, already sold 1 million. ""Rock That Body"" is the 5th single.

He debuted as the main rapper of BTS in June 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment (now: BIGHIT MUSIC).

Prior to his debut, he was an underground hip-hop rapper under the name ""Gloss"" that self-wrote and produced his music. Suga adopted the alias Agust D in 2016, which is derived from the initials ""DT"", short for his birth place ""Daegu Town"", and ""Suga"" spelled backwards.

His first self-produced mixtape, Agust D was released on August 16, 2016 via SoundCloud. He intended to release his music for free in the form of a mixtape instead of a commercial studio album, describing it as the ""feeling of being trapped in some sort of framework."" On the record, he discussed matters such as his struggles with depression and social phobia. Fuse TV rated it as one of the top twenty mixtapes of 2016.

Suga re-released his mixtape for digital purchase and streaming in February 2018. The success of the reissue placed it at number three on Billboard's World Albums Chart, number five on the Heatseekers Albums Chart, and caused Suga's solo alias, Agust D, to reach number 46 on the Emerging Artists chart for the week of March 3.

In 2020, he released his second solo mixtape D-2 along with the lead single Daechwita on May 22. The mixtape consists of ten tracks, with songs sung and rapped in both Korean and English. Its lyrics share his viewpoint of the contemporary world. D-2 is according to him ""a documentation of myself from 2016 onwards"".

His debut solo album D-Day was released on April 21, 2023. Featuring the singles People Pt. 2 and Haegum, the album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, tying him with teammate Jimin as the highest-charting South Korean solo artists in the history of the chart.

Suga is responsible for writing, composing and arranging, as well as mixing and mastering his material. He has over 150 registered songs accredited to his name with the Korea Music Copyright Association. Including Suran's WINE, which peaked at number two on the Gaon Music Chart and won Best R&B at the 2017 Melon Music Awards.
The foundation of his lyrics involve themes that are ""full of dreams and hope"", conceived with the intent of his music becoming ""many people's strength"". He cites Stony Skunk and Epik High as his inspirations to pursue hip hop music. Particularly, he credits the former's reggae-hip-hop hybrid album Ragga Muffin (2005) and its title track for igniting his interest in the genre, calling it ""completely different"" from mainstream music.

Suga started his mandatory military service on the 22nd of September 2023. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Agust+D"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
40,40,wiz khalifa,3395400,70149407,"Cameron Jibril Thomaz (born September 8, 1987 in Minot, North Dakota), better known by his stage name Wiz Khalifa, is an American rapper based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, signed to Rostrum Records. According to the Black and Yellow Songfacts, his stage name is derived from khalifa, an Arabic word meaning ""successor"", and wisdom. His nickname growing up was ""Wizard"" which was shortened to Wiz when Khalifa was fifteen.

In 2005 he released his first official mixtape, Prince of the City: Welcome to Pistolvania, and later in 2006 he released his first full length street album entitled Show and Prove. Since then he has released a further six mixtapes and a collaboration mixtape titled How Fly with friend Curren$y. He released his debut album, Deal or No Deal, in November of 2009, it reached #1 on the iTunes hip hop chart, and then reached the top ten on iTunes' overall album chart the week it was released. Previously signed to Warner Bros. Records, he left the label in July 2009 after numerous delays in releasing his planned debut album for the label, First Flight. Khalifa stated to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that, ""I learned a lot during my time there and matured as an artist during the process. I'm happy to be moving on with all of my material and having the chance to be in control of my next moves"".He is also the founder of the rap crew Taylor Gang, which includes friends Kev Tha Hustler, Ekko, Smallz Money and Gene Stovall. They derived the name from the fact they always used to wear Chuck Taylor shoes.

Khalifa was born on September 8, 1987 in Minot, North Dakota to a mother and a father serving in the military. The family moved to Pittsburgh when Khalifa was the age of two. His parents' military service caused the family to move on a regular basis. 
Over the next thirteen years, he would move between Pittsburgh and South Carolina, Georgia, Oklahoma, Germany, Japan, and England as his parents were reassigned to different posts. In October of 1990 Wiz was separated from his mother,who left him in the hands of her sister while she served in Operation Desert Storm.

During his travels, Wiz was forced to mature quicker than his peers. He was constantly faced with new surroundings, new schools, and new sets of friends, and he found it difficult to become attached to anyone outside his family roots. This nomadic life gave Wiz an opportunity, though, to broaden his mind and offered him many experiences from which to draw inspiration. He began to perceive the world differently than most kids, and he would write his thoughts down every day.These thoughts would become the foundation for his future recordings.

By the age of 14, with a few songs under his belt, Wiz was already drawing comparisons with his commanding voice and witty wordplay. While he has been influenced by artists such as Jay-Z, Camron, and the Notorious B.I.G., Wiz was determined to create his own identity that would, one day, be loved and revered by fans.

Ready to take the next step, Wiz began his search for a recording studio to record new songs. He found one, ID LABS, where owner Eric Dan immediately recognized Wiz's talents. Along with Chad Glick of ID Management, they began to network Wiz to another Pittsburgh native, Benjy Grinberg of Rostrum Records. Benjy realized the raw talent that Wiz possessed, and immediately brought him into the Rostrum family in 2002.

Soon after, Wiz Khalifa began his ascent into the music scene in the Pittsburgh area. He has been hailed by the award winning Pittsburgh Post-Gazette pop music critic, Ed Masley, as having “the skills, the looks, the confidence, the drive, and the charisma for the job.” The New Pittsburgh Courier says, “The combination of a young, charismatic M.C. with a slew of stop-and-rewind rhymes together with a local independent label with major industry connections has set the stage for a hip-hop artist representing Pittsburgh to reach superstar status for the first time ever.

In 2010, with the success of Kush and Orange Juice still present, Wiz Khalifa signed with Atlantic Records. Wiz's style along with his production team, Johnny Juliano, Sledgren, and E. Dan make this a winning combination for success. 

He is also well known for his debut single for Atlantic, ""Black and Yellow"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. His debut album for the label, Rolling Papers, was released on March 29, 2011. He followed that album with O.N.I.F.C. (abbreviated for mainstream markets from ""Only Nigga In First Class"") on December 4, 2012 which was backed by the singles ""Work Hard, Play Hard"" and ""Remember You"". O.N.I.F.C. debuted at number two with 131,000 in first week sales.

Pittsburgh City Council declared 12-12-12 (December 12, 2012) to be Wiz Khalifa Day in the city. Khalifa graduated from Pittsburgh's Taylor Allderdice High School and in January 2012, purchased a home in nearby Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.

In April 2013, Khalifa revealed that after having his son he decided to work on a new album that he was planning to release in 2013. On April 17, 2013, Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y announced that they will drop their collaboration EP Live in Concert on April 20, 2013. The EP featured seven new songs. On June 24, 2013, he announced that his fifth studio album would be titled Blacc Hollywood and would be released in 2013. On September 3, 2013, Khalifa revealed he had recorded songs with Miley Cyrus, Adele and Juicy J for Blacc Hollywood. In October 2013, Mannie Fresh confirmed that he provided production for the album. On February 11, 2014, Khalifa released Blacc Hollywood's first single titled ""We Dem Boyz"". The album was then supported by the singles ""KK"", ""You and Your Friends"", ""Stayin Out All Night"", ""Promises"" and ""So High"". 

Khalifa released an EP with TY Dolla $ign on March 31, 2015, entitled ""Talk About It In the Morning"". That same month, Wiz released the lead single for the film ""Furious 7"" called ""See You Again"" as a tribute to Paul Walker. The single has since gone on to global success. ""See You Again"" spent 12 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, tying for the longest-running rap number-one hit in the US. 

On January 23, 2015, Khalifa was featured on a remix release of the Fall Out Boy song ""Uma Thurman"". On May 18, they performed the song together on the 2015 Billboard Music Awards show. In the summer of 2015, he began touring the United States with Fall Out Boy and Hoodie Allen in a tour titled ""The Boys of Zummer Tour"". The tour featured performances of ""Uma Thurman"" by Fall Out Boy and Khalifa. Later that year, on December 15, 2015, Wiz released the mixtape ""Cabin Fever 3"". During the Golden Globes on January 10, 2016, Wiz announced that his next album, titled Khalifa, would be released on the 22nd of that month. However, the album was released on February 5, 2016. On May 24, 2016, he released ""Pull Up"", a standalone single in promotion of his sixth album, Rolling Papers 2, which was released on July 13, 2018.

On April 20, 2020, Khalifa released, The Saga of Wiz Khalifa. The album included collaborations with Tyga, Logic, Mustard and Ty Dolla $ign. In May 2020, Khalifa featured on the song ""Drums Drums Drums"" with Travis Barker.

44,44,1nonly,532974,22967326,"Nathan Scott Fuller (April 6, 2004) known by his stage name 1NONLY is an Korean-American singer, rapper and songwriter born in Las Vegas, Nevada. He is best acknowledged for his hit single ''Stay With Me'' accumulating over 300 million streams on Spotify. His primary genre of music is considered ''Aesthetic Rap'', however his initial start of his musical career started with the production of ""Bedroom Pop"" & ""Lo-Fi"" generating songs such as ""Forever In Love"", ""Sorry, I Like You"", ""I Fell In Love With You One Night In June"" & ""Pretty Girl"". 

Born in Las Vegas, Nevada, 1nonly first dabbled in Garageband in music class, often for fun without any real serious intent. However, 1nonly's first known song, Forever in Love, would be first uploaded to Soundcloud on the 16th of January, 2019. This sparked the production of his Bedroom Pop genre of music. However, his very first song, Clear Skies was published in 2018 and was emo rap. His songs were regarding love and delicate emotions, often ran by a lofi-style hip-hop beat. This genre of music would continue, with small differences such as the addition of stronger bass and percussion until the 18th of June, 2020, as the release of ""Doc Martens"" would be the song that kickstarts his now present day genre of Aesthetic Rap. This new wave of rap, wouldn't have been popularised and formed without 1nonly's own inspirations of Lil Peep, $not and many other artists that helped shaped this new genre. 

After realising the success Doc Martens received, he would later on the 15th of August, release, now a widely recognized song, Bunny Girl. This song was a massive success, receiving over tens of millions of streams across a multitude of platforms, and he would later upload an official music video to part with the song to YouTube. He continued to stick with the Aesthetic Rap genre and would go on to make memorable songs such as ""Shakira!"", ""Lovely"", ""Fuck You!"" etc. On the 11th of October, 2020, 1nonly would go onto to release his new song ""Stay with Me"". This song would reach records he had not achieved, and by date of creation has amassed over 150+ million streams on Spotify, causing it to go platinum. His unique style of lyrics and use of TikTok famous songs as sample truly secures an devoted audience. He would eventually be exclusively signed to Warner Records.

1nonly is known for collaborating with many artists, to name, Lilbubblegum, Shady Moon, Ciscaux and other popular underground artists such as Freddie Dredd and Jasiah. He has also been featured on Softwilly's YouTube channel in their video ""We made a BANGER album on discord"", and sang on ILY BABY - 1NONLY x SHADYMOON x VOID x LARRY and CHROME BERETTA (ft. Satori Zoom, Void, & Lex Pain). He is currently part of the rap collective ""The World Is Yours"". 1nonly's most notable producers are Nategoyard, $UPREME, and Shenrxn.

As of lately, 1nonly has changed his style of making music, focusing on shaping his own sound and moving away from the Aesthetic Rap genre. His other biggest hit, ""Step Back!"" featuring SXMPRA, a Phonk rap type beat that has amassed over 100 million streams, with the song blowing up on Tiktok and a music video published onto Youtube. This goes to show his versatility in his art and the switch up on his sound in which was carried over from his music he made in 2020-2021. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/1NONLY"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

49,49,clams casino,826069,19223030,"Clams Casino is the pseudonym of New Jersey resident Michael Volpe, who has shot from relative obscurity to production sensation thanks to a handful of blistering tracks. Edging into the limelight after passing tunes to Soulja Boy and Bay Area superstar Lil B, his originality has resonated with more than just rap fans. Clams hasn’t confined his songwriting to rap music alone, and listening to his productions you can hear a keen sense of harmony, a pop sensibility and a willingness to let sounds dissolve into an uncharacteristic dream-like haze.

After a genre-bending EP Rainforest on the esteemed Tri Angle label, his LP ""Instrumentals"" compiles some of Clams’ most crucial and sought after beats. Surprisingly, with the raps stripped away the tracks take on a life of their own, and hearing Clams’ intricate productions with the space to breathe feels like a real privilege. The half-heard vocals, twisted, rolling beats and acid-bathed samples are now pushed to the forefront, and you’d struggle to hear how a rapper, no matter how competent would manage to compete with such precise songwriting. Clams’ real skill is to combine the delirious club sound of post-2010 rap with something almost unheard in the genre. His sound is totally unique, and as he punctuates tracks with blissful ambience and inspired samples it’s hard not to believe this is a producer destined for true greatness.

Platin Casino sponsored the  release of a second instrumental mixtape, simply titled Instrumental Mixtape 2, for free via his Twitter on June 4, 2012. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Clams+Casino"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

52,52,mac miller,2953883,326290011,"Malcolm McCormick, also known by his stage name Mac Miller, was an American rapper, singer-songwriter and record producer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was also a noted record producer under the pseudonym Larry Fisherman. Raised Jewish and teaching himself music from a young age, McCormick defied the stereotypes of hip-hop and released his first mixtape under the name EZ Mac, titled ""But My Mackin' Ain't Easy"" in 2007, when McCormick was only fifteen. He released many more in his lifetime, including ""K.I.D.S."" in 2010, which earned Mac widespread attention in the hip-hop scene, and ""Best Day Ever"" in 2011, which featured the hit single ""Donald Trump"". 

He was signed to Pittsburgh-based Rostrum Records and released his debut album Blue Slide Park on November 8, 2011, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 despite being released completely independently. He released five studio albums in his lifetime, which all peaked in the top 5, along with a posthumous album titled ""Circles"" with help from producer Jon Brion and Miller's family.

In 2013, Miller released his second studio album, ""Watching Movies With the Sound Off"". The album featured artists such as Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler, The Creator, Ab-Soul, and long-time friend ScHoolboy Q. The album took a more personal approach compared to his previous works.

In 2014, Miller released the 24-track mixtape ""Faces"". Considered by many to be one of his best works, he explores themes of drug use, employing and featuring collaborators of Mac from his previous album, including ScHoolboy Q and Earl Sweatshirt, but also sees new faces such as Rick Ross. 

In 2015, Mac released his third studio album, ""GO:OD AM"", his first with new label Warner Records. The album featured a more energetic and vibrant theme than ""Faces"" and ""Watching Movies With the Sound Off"", reflecting a more optimistic,  redemptive angle on his personal life, while maintaining elements of his introspective and thought-provoking style from earlier works.

In 2016, Miller released his fourth studio album, titled ""The Divine Feminine"". He explores themes of love and femininity, largely influenced by his relationship with Ariana Grande at the time and featuring appearances from the likes of Kendrick Lamar and Anderson Paak. 

In August 2018, following major events in Miller's life, including his breakup with Ariana Grande, with Miller's drug addiction alleged to be a contributing factor, as well as a car crash incident in which McCormick was charged with a DUI, Miller released his fifth and final studio album during his lifetime titled ""Swimming"". Continuing the dive into his personal life, Miller explores his heartfelt struggles and grief in the past, but remains optimistic for the future. Swimming was nominated for Best Rap Album posthumously at the 2019 Grammy Awards.

Miller had struggled with substance abuse for a long time before his death. On September 7, 2018, he was found dead in his home in Los Angeles, California from an accidental overdose of fentanyl, cocaine, and alcohol, only a little over a month after the release of ""Swimming"".  He was only 26 years old. McCormick was buried in his hometown of Pittsburgh. Miller's passing was largely unexpected and had a large impact on the hip-hop community as a whole, with many paying their respects to Miller.  On October 31, 2018, a tribute concert, titled ""Mac Miller: A Celebration of Life"", featured renowned artists and many longtime collaborators of Miller including Travis Scott, ScHoolboy Q, SZA, Chance the Rapper, and Earl Sweatshirt. The concert was a celebration of the late rapper's life and musical achievements, and all profits were donated to the Mac Miller Circles Fund, which provides young people from underprivileged backgrounds with opportunities to explore arts and music.

 In January 2020, Miller's posthumous album titled ""Circles"", worked on in companionship with his album ""Swimming"", was announced on January 8 along with the single ""Good News"" and released later that month. Every track on the album was accompanied by a video of the same name, often with psychedelic imagery and images of Mac before his passing and throughout his life. With a more melancholic theme compared to his previous works, the album was well-received by fans and critics alike, renowned for the care placed in continuing Mac's artistic vision. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mac+Miller"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

61,61,ynw melly,877058,28816996,"Jamell Maurice Demons (born May 1, 1999), better known by his stage name YNW Melly, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter who emerged from Gifford, Florida. YNW Melly is also co-founder of rap collective, YNW. His music often draws from his lived experiences, evidenced by his 2017 incarceration for weapons charges. Upon release, he began to gain popularity from his track “Murder On My Mind.” which he wrote while in jail. After the release of the track, he was once again arrested as the song violated his probation, and sent him back to prison.

Melly’s career initially started to take off in 2018 when singles such as “Virtual (Blue Balenciagas)”, “Butter Pecan”, and “772 Love” had begun to gain popularity alongside “Murder on My Mind.”

On August 3, 2018, Melly released his debut mixtape I AM YOU which included his popular single, “Murder on My Mind”. It also included a sequel to the song called “Mind on My Murder”.

After leaving the studio with companions YNW Bortlen, YNW SakChaser, and YNW Juvy, on the night of October 26, 2018, Melly and his friends had been caught in a drive-by-shooting where SakChaser and Juvy were murdered. Melly and Bortlen were the only survivors of the attack.

While working on his sophomore mixtape, after the death of his friends, Melly had gained more attention and began to obtain cosigns from several rappers such as Young Thug, Trippie Redd, and Kodak Black. However, on January 3, 2019, Melly was arrested for possession of marijuana.

On January 18, 2019, while incarcerated, Melly released his sophomore mixtape We All Shine, which included one of his most influential cosign’s, Kanye West who was a feature on the song “Mixed Personalities.”.

Melly was released from jail on January 25, 2019, and released “Gang”, the first day out single that had taken off after the hype around “Mixed Personalities.”

After being released for only a month, on February 13, 2019, Melly turned himself in after a warrant was put out for him and Bortlen connecting to the murders of YNW Sakchaser and YNW Juvy. YNW Melly posted this to his Instagram on February 13:

To all my fans and supporters no I did not get locked up in Washington , but I am turning myself in today I want you guys to know I love you and appreciate every single one of y'all, a couple months ago I lost my two brothers by violence and now the system want to find justice.. unfortunately a lot of rumors and lies are being said but no worries god is with me and my brother @ynw.bortlen and we want y'all to remember it’s a ynw Family I love you @ynwsakchaser1 and @ynwjuvy #freeus

Prior to his incarceration, songs such as “Murder on My Mind” and “Mind on My Murder” had gained traction making their way in the Billboard Hot 100 and gaining RIAA certifications in a matter of months. Speculations made people believe that the songs were related to the murders, however, they were soon put to rest due to the time of the recordings being almost two years prior to the shootings.

After spending months incarcerated, on November 22, 2019, he released his debut studio album, Melly vs. Melvin featuring his 9lokkNine-assisted “223’s”.

After the rise of COVID-19 disease in 2020, on April 3, Melly had tested positive for the virus while awaiting trial. After being infected, Melly’s lawyers tried to play this to his advantage and requested a medical release as conditions can worsen in the jail environment. Melly was denied release on April 17 and conditions have been said to worsen since.

After the release of fellow Floridian rapper Kodak Black, Melly’s team had taken advantage and released “Thugged Out” to keep Melly’s name alive in the industry. They carried on releasing singles throughout the year with artists such as Queen Naija and Hotboii.

Again, while still awaiting trial, on August 13, 2021, he released his sophomore studio album, Just A Matter of Slime, featuring his highly anticipated Lil Uzi Vert-assisted “Mind of Melvin”.

After prosecutors had claimed they had a confession of Melly admitting to the murders, on November 1, Melly’s lawyers came out and denied the claims and said that Melly was just rapping a song titled “4:30 AM” by Kevin Gates. Soon after, on November 30, Melly’s trial had been set for March 7, 2022. - TippleTripple123 <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/YNW+Melly"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

65,65,$uicideboy$,1268920,338667899,"$uicideboy$ are an American hip-hop duo from New Orleans, Louisiana, founded in 2014 by cousins Ruby da Cherry and $crim. Via the music sharing platform SoundCloud, the duo rose to popularity for their abrasive, self-produced beats, as well as their harsh lyrical content and themes prominently featuring substance use disorder and suicidal ideation. The duo are considered one of the most popular artists in the underground rap scene. They own and operate their own label, G*59 Records, under which all of their music is signed. 

The music of $uicideBoy$ varies between different sub-genres of rap; while some songs have melancholy tones with lyrical content that focuses on subjects such as depression and suicidal ideation (topics not widely exposed in rap music), others are wildly aggressive, with themes of violence and sexual content. Some of their music is based around life growing up in New Orleans; song titles such as Audubon, Tulane, Elysian Fields and St. Bernard reflect streets and neighborhoods that influenced the life of Arceneaux and Petrou. A large portion of their music focuses on depression and its symptoms, an angle not often received in mainstream hip hop; Arceneaux elaborated on this in an interview with Mass Appeal, stating, “A lot of people take it as emo, or depressed music, or negative music... it’s really just connecting. It’s therapy, through music"". Excluding occasional guest producers, the entirety of Suicideboys' discography is self-produced, mainly by Arceneaux under his pseudonym Budd Dwyer (an homage to the former politician of the same name).

$crim was born Scott Arceneaux Jr. on April 11, 1989 in Marrero, Louisiana. Arceneaux originally was inspired by T-Pain and Kanye West to produce music, buying his first laptop which he used to start DJing with money gained from selling drugs. Arceneaux's passion for DJing extended when he started to attend Delgado Community College, where he was hired to DJ parties. He also worked selling used furniture, getting fired for his new hand tattoos after three years.

Ruby da Cherry was born Aristos Petrou (Αρίστος Πέτρου) on April 22, 1990 to an American mother and Greek Cypriot father. Raised in Metairie, Louisiana, Petrou's interest in music began when he was seven, playing violin and then drums when he was ten, eventually joining bands in middle school. He worked at his father's restaurant as a waiter, a job he held until 2015. His experience with the punk rock scene continued as he joined the band Vapo-Rats as its drummer; however, disillusioned with the apathy his bandmates showed towards the future of the band, Petrou left in order to pursue a career in hip-hop with Arceneaux.

Arceneaux and Petrou are cousins, and as such shared a close relationship growing up. Realising that both were interested in taking a musical career seriously, and both dissatisfied with the direction of their lives, the two formed Suicideboys, making a pact that if their musical career didn’t work out, they would both commit suicide. Elaborating on this in an interview with Mass Appeal, Arceneaux states that, “it was pretty much like cutting the hand, bleeding, and making a pact that there’s no plan B, that if this doesn’t happen by the time we’re 30, I’m blowing my head off”.

The duo's first project together, a three-track EP named Kill Yourself Part I: The $uicide $aga, was released in June 2014 on SoundCloud and Bandcamp, attracting attention for their collaboration with notable underground rapper Bones. In the following months, the duo released a further nine iterations of the Kill Yourself series. After a number of collaboration EPs with fellow underground artist Black Smurf, their first full length project titled Gray/Grey was released on March 3, 2015.

Suicideboys' underground breakthrough came with the release of 2015 EP $outh $ide $uicide, a collaboration with established South Florida rapper Pouya, which thrust the duo into the underground rap spotlight. Other 2015 releases include 7th or St. Tammany, YUNGDEATHLILLIFE, High Tide in the Snake's Nest, Grey Sheep EP, I No Longer Fear The Razor Guarding My Heel (part I and II), My Liver Will Handle What My Heart Can't, Now The Moon's Rising and G.R.E.Y.G.O.D.S. with fellow g59 rapper RAMIREZ.

 The duo's first foray onto the mainstream musical charts came with the release of Radical $uicide in the summer of 2016. The five-track EP, produced by EDM musician Getter, peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Rap charts. Other 2016 releases include Dark Side of the Clouds, Grey Sheep II, Eternal Grey, I No Longer Fear The Razor Guarding My Heel (part III), G.R.E.Y.G.O.D.S.I.I. with [artis]RAMIREZ, DIRTYNASTY$UICIDE with GERM, and Black $uicide Side C with Black Smurf.

In 2017 the boys released another 10 iterations of the Kill Yourself series, they also dropped DIRTIERNASTIER$UICIDE, with GERM.

On September 7, 2018, their debut studio album I Want to Die in New Orleans was released. A statement posted by the duo's official Instagram account stated, ""We started recording this album in the beginning of 2017. Initially we wanted to write about our experiences on the road and express how our lives had become slightly more extravagant.""

In late 2018, a rumor arose that the group had broken up following a series of ominous tweets. However, they soon clarified that the tweets were in relation to ""personal issues"" facing Arceneaux, and that they had in fact not broken up. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/$uicideboy$"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

66,66,dj khaled,2499029,49288287,"Khaled Mohammed Khaled (/ˈkælɪd/; born November 26, 1975),[3] known professionally as DJ Khaled, is an American DJ, record producer, and record executive. Originally a Miami-based radio personality, Khaled has since become known for enlisting high-profile music industry artists to perform on singles and albums, for which he often serves as hype man. His distinctions are his booming voice presence, ""motivational"" abstractions, and numerous catchphrases. While his musical contribution is often questioned, Khaled's role has been described as ""organization, direction, [and] promotion"".[4][5]

Khaled was born in New Orleans to Palestinian immigrant parents. He first gained recognition as a radio host in the 1990s for the radio station 99 Jamz, and translated his popularity by working with Fat Joe's hip hop collective, Terror Squad, as a DJ for their live performances. Following his production credits on the group's material,[6] Khaled enlisted several hip hop artists associated with the group and his native Miami to perform on his debut studio album, Listennn... the Album (2006). His second album, We the Best (2007), spawned the hit single ""I'm So Hood"" (featuring T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross and Plies). His two subsequent releases—We Global (2008) and Victory (2010)—both peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200; the latter was supported by the single ""All I Do Is Win"" (featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross), which received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

His fifth studio album and major label debut, We the Best Forever (2011), saw continued commercial success and brought Khaled to mainstream prominence by spawning his first Billboard Hot 100-top ten single, ""I'm on One"" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross and Lil Wayne). His following three albums—Kiss the Ring (2012), Suffering from Success (2013), and I Changed a Lot (2015)—were released to moderate critical and commercial reception.[7] Throughout 2015 and 2016, Khaled gained wider recognition as a public figure due to his social media activity. This, along with several Internet memes, foresaw the release of his ninth studio album, Major Key (2016), which was met with further critical and commercial success as it debuted atop the Billboard 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.

His tenth album, Grateful (2017), became his second consecutive number-one album and was preceded by the singles ""I'm the One"" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) and ""Wild Thoughts"" (featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller), which peaked at numbers one and two on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. His eleventh album, Father of Asahd (2019), contained the song ""Higher"" (featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend), which won Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards—Khaled's first Grammy Award win. His eponymous twelfth album (2021) and thirteenth album, God Did (2022), both debuted atop the Billboard 200. The latter's title track (featuring Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend and Fridayy) earned three nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance.

Outside of music, Khaled has gained success as a writer, with his book The Keys featuring on the New York Times Best Seller list. He has also performed as an actor for the films Spies in Disguise (2019) and Bad Boys for Life (2020). His record label, We the Best Music Group has distributed his releases since its formation in 2008, though Khaled signed other artists to the imprint including Ace Hood, Kent Jones, Mavado, Flipp Dinero, and Vado, among others. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Khaled"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

68,68,6ix9ine,930995,24685699,"Daniel Hernandez (born May 8, 1996) professionally known as 6ix9ine or Tekashi69, is a Mexican-American rapper who is based in Brooklyn. Hernandez is known for his distinctive rainbow-themed look, tattoos, aggressive style of rapping, public feuds with fellow celebrities, legal issues, and controversial public persona.

Hernandez rose to mainstream fame in late 2017 with the release of his debut single ""Gummo"", which was certified platinum by the RIAA. In early 2018, Hernandez released his debut mixtape, Day69, which debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 album chart. He later earned his first top-five entry on the Billboard Hot 100 with ""Fefe"", featuring Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz, which peaked at number three on the chart. His debut studio album, Dummy Boy, was released on November 27, 2018, after being delayed a week earlier due to his arrest, and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. 

Hernandez pled guilty to using a 13-year-old child in a sexual performance in 2015. He was arrested in November 2018 on racketeering and firearm charges, among others, for which he is facing a possible life sentence in federal prison.

Early Life
He was raised with his older brother by his parents until he was 13, when his father was shot dead steps away from the family home. Emotionally disturbed by the death of his father, Hernandez started to act out and was eventually expelled from school in the 8th grade for bad behavior. Rather than continue his education, he started working various odd jobs such as working as a busboy to help his mother financially. Hernandez also dealt drugs to supplement his income, most notably selling cannabis and heroin on the streets while working at a local Brooklyn bodega. He was eventually arrested for his criminal activities and sentenced to prison time at Rikers Island, where he began to associate himself with the Nine Trey Gangsters, a prison subset of the Bloods street gang. Hernandez began his career as a rapper in 2014, releasing songs such as ""69"" and ""Scumlife"". Other early songs were taken down by YouTube.

Career
Hernandez began releasing rap songs in 2014. Over the next three years, he released multiple tracks and videos with titles such as ""Scumlife"", ""Yokai"", and ""Hellsing Station"", drawing attention for his aggressive rapping style and use of anime as music video visuals. Many of his early songs were released by FCK THEM, a music label based in Slovakia. Gathering fame as an internet meme for his rainbow-dyed hair and rainbow-plated grills, he eventually became an associate of fellow New York rapper ZillaKami. They later feuded after Hernandez allegedly stole instrumentals and songs they had made together.

Hernandez's commercial debut single ""Gummo"" was released on November 10, 2017, and eventually peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was certified platinum by the RIAA on March 5, 2018. His next single, ""Kooda"", debuted at number 61 on the Hot 100 the week of December 23, 2017. On January 14, 2018, Hernandez released his third single, ""Keke"", with Fetty Wap and A Boogie wit da Hoodie, which also charted on the Hot 100.

Shortly afterward, Hernandez announced his debut mixtape, titled Day69. The mixtape was released on February 23, 2018, and debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 album chart with 55,000 album-equivalent units, of which 20,000 were pure sales. According to Jon Caramanica of The New York Times, the tape was an outgrowth of the ""SoundCloud rap explosion"", and was notable for its willingness to deviate from hip-hop's prevailing sound. After the release of Day69, two songs from the album, ""Billy"" and ""Rondo"" both debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, with ""Billy"" peaking at number 50 and ""Rondo"" at number 73.

In April 2018, Hernandez released ""Gotti"", a remix of a feature he did for artist Packman titled ""Got it, Got it"". The song's video was released on April 16, 2018, and involved footage of Hernandez donating bundles of $100 bills to poor citizens in the Dominican Republic. The song was added to Day69 as a deluxe song and debuted at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 before dropping off the following week, making it his sixth consecutive Hot 100 entry.

Hernandez stirred up controversy in May 2018 when he was involved in a shooting with the entourage of fellow New York rapper Casanova as part of a feud; this led to Hernandez losing a $5 million headphone deal and being banned from the Barclays Center. After the shooting, Hernandez stopped releasing music for several months, before releasing ""Tati"", featuring DJ Spinking in June, which debuted at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100.

In July 2018, Hernandez released his eighth single, ""Fefe"", featuring Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz; the single debuted at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 before peaking at number three in its second week, marking 6ix9ine's highest entry on the chart and his first single to reach the top five of the Hot 100. ""Fefe"" was later certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. His subsequent singles, ""Bebe"" and ""Stoopid"", also reached the top 30 of the Hot 100.

In early October 2018, Hernandez was featured on the song ""Aulos Reloaded"" with French house DJ Vladimir Cauchemar and ""Kick"" with Danish singer Jimilian.

On November 7, 2018, it was announced that his debut studio album, Dummy Boy, was to be released on November 23, but on November 21, it was announced that the album would be postponed. The album was ultimately released without notice on November 27, on all streaming services. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/6ix9ine"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1) Christopher Maurice Brown (born May 5, 1989) from Tappahannock, Virginia.

71,71,landy,36073,701290,"There are at least two artists called Landy.

1. LANDy is Adam Goldberg, with the likes of Steven Drozd of Flaming Lips, Aaron Espinoza of Earlimart, a host of others, and often times Goldberg very much alone. LANDy's are songs of love and loss. Renditions of contrition. If you've ever been jilted or are generally antipathetic you'll get a kick out of LANDy! LANDy's debut album, ""Eros and Omissions,"" was recorded in Los Angeles, New York, and Norman, Oklahoma, in studios, living rooms, and truck stops (not really). It began in earnest in 2002 and was completed bombastically in 2008, clocking in with 18 tunes--a little something for everyone. Or a lot of something for someone. It's a Best Of! It's a debut!

In 2015, at age 19, Lil Baby went to prison for two years for a probation violation. Upon his release in 2017, he jump-started his rap career with a mixtape called Perfect Timing, released in April of that year. The mixtape featured cameos from friends like Lil Yachty, Young Thug, and Gunna, and strong production from 808 Mafia, Brickz, and many others, highlighted by Lil Baby's woozy flows. The mixtape immediately brought the young rapper fame, in part due to his affiliations with friends in the Quality Control family of artists as well as the 4 Pockets Full clique. As his mixtape attracted more listeners, Lil Baby worked constantly on new music, releasing singles like ""My Dawg"" and the Young Thug collaboration ""Pink Slip"""" in the summer of 2017.

Since it's release in early January, NLE Choppa's ""Shotta Flow"" video has amassed more than 12 million views in nearly six weeks. The visual for his breakout record shows a precocious youth who is just as adept at dancing as he is at swinging choppas.

His flows and stylistic choices recall his friend and fellow hometown rapper BlocBoy JB. Yet Choppa is unique. His intensity, voice and dark sense of humor set him apart from the fray. His follow-up record, ""Shotta Flow 2,"" is approaching 2 million views in under a week.

Always business-savvy, Choppa turned down a $3 million dollar deal and opted for a partnership with UnitedMasters, a company that distributes his music while allowing him to keep his masters. With an EP coming in the spring and more videos on the way, the young artist's name is everywhere, even catching the attention of legendary rap mogul Birdman, who he's been spotted sharing studio time with. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/NLE+Choppa"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1) Hardcore arranger, principal arranger of KINZOK ON from Japan.
Also known as morrrrrro
KINZOK ON bandcamp: https://kinzokon.bandcamp.com/music
MORO on Twitter: https://twitter.com/moro_108


2) Moro is a beast composed of two reasonably-sentient beings: Nolan Thomas and Daniel Lee Ruff Smith, and born in the hills surrounding a village known as Eau Claire, WI. The beast is sometimes called ""M o r o"", or ""M O R O"" by different tribes.

After writhing in front of crowds of jubilant townsfolk a few times, and Lee Ruff taking a brief absence to travel to the Land of Thais, it regurgitated it's first offspring-- ""Embers""-- in a fiery cough. The townsfolk went mad for it, but it was too jittery to stay in one place, so it travelled throughout the globe on the back of the root-god Pando, whom some know as The Interwebs, among other names. The child was aided in it's travels by MJMJ Records and many friends.

Then Lee Ruff heard callings from afar, and split from it's Nolan-half to gain knowledge in the far off land of España for one half an earth cycle. Though less powerful due to their separation, the two beings were able to communicate with the aid of their friend-god Pando, speaking into his roots and sensing the vibrations on the other end. 

With a seed planted in their minds by the ancient tree-and-worker guardians, Simon & Garfunkel, they combined their powers and dreamed into existence their second child, ""Sound of Silence"". This child was requested of them by the Pando-rider Cactus-Mouth, who then took it forth along the roots and raised it as his own. 

It was then that Nolan-half began to feel unsatisfied with his choice to study the ancient and time-honored craft of Illustration, and made leave from the temple of UW-Eau Claire, at least for a time. With his newfound freedom and an approaching 21st birth-festival, his mother, Keli, offered forth the means for Nolan-half to visit the city København, in the realm of Danmark-- close to the Witch Woods of Sverige, where the Old Gods dwell. He sought refuge with his pal-being Mirko, and stayed in the living room of two wonderful she-Danes. 

By some chance of fate, Lee Ruff was also in the region, and the two beings were able to briefly reunite in the north-country of Uppsala, deep within the Witch Woods of Sverige. It was a long and perilous journey for Nolan-half, battling Sex-Trolls and SJ Railways, and his ability to communicate with Pando grew weak, causing many confusions. But through it all, he eventually found the Lee Ruff, and all was merry. Moro stomped as one through the halls of Upsalla by day, and gazed into it's clear pools by night, discussing with reasonable-sentience the nature of The Creator or The Great Unknown. Cats and ducks came to listen in and gain knowledge, but were keen to hide their own sentience. 

Alas, Moro was forced to split once again, returning to Eau Claire and España respectively. Nolan-half used up all his coins on food and travel in Danmark and Sverige, and now really really needs to get a job.

The two halves of Moro have resolved to sleep until June of the earth-cycle 2011, when they can be reunited once more in the village Eau Claire, and writhe for crowds and spew forth new offspring, and send them forth into the world with Pando and alive with Moro's magical instruments, and travel throughout the land with village-friends and make many many anew. The beast will be unstoppable. maybe. It will never stop dreaming.

His 5th EP ""Mall Music"" was released in 2017, supported by the singles ""Compliments"", ""Spiraling"", ""Intimacy"" & ""All Out in the Open"".

Mesita would release his 6th EP ""Repackaged Trash"" in December 2018.
Sometime in 2019, he would become viral on X (Formerly Twitter) for doing short under 1-minute songs for people who asked. This led to the album ""You Are Beautiful"" in 2019, which consisted of longer versions of these styles of songs. This would eventually turn into a series in his discography, with ""You're Still Beautiful"", ""am i still beautiful"" and ""everyone is beautiful"".
After ""You Are Beautiful"", Mesita would release his 7th EP Blackwhite. All of the songs off of Blackwhite were released as singles before the release of the EP.
In 2019, Mesita would release their 7th Album Eat Ass or Die Trying.

After this album, Mesita's releases would become scarce, only dropping songs just to immediately delete them off of whatever platform it was uploaded to.

Characterized by their face tattoos, facial piercings, eccentric hairstyles, and androgynous fashion, their music is often defined by dark subject matters and imagery built on a melodic emo approach to trap.

Shortly after the release of their first project, Woods caught the attention of then industry-mainstays like Mob.

The EP and following features caught the attention of producer and cofounder of Atlantic Records Don Cannon after DJ Diamond Kuts played one of their songs on a local radio station. Cannon then produced and hosted their first mixtape, ""The Real Uzi"", which was released on August 5, 2014. After the release of ""The Real Uzi"", Woods signed a record deal with Atlantic Records through DJ Drama, Don Cannon's, and Leighton Morrison's imprint, Generation Now.

Following their signing to Atlantic Records, Woods was featured alongside Kid and Ferg on Carnage's single ""WDYW"". They also released several songs on SoundCloud including ""No Wait"", produced by Metro Booming, ""Pressure"", which is a collaboration with Durk, and  ''Loaf"".

2017: Luv Is Rage 2
Uzi was featured on Migos' single ""Bad and Boujee"". The single was released on August 31, 2016, and its from the trio's second studio album ""Culture"".

On February 27, 2017, Woods released the EP ""Luv Is Rage 1.5"" while on tour with The Weeknd. The EP was positively received for its ""nerdy"" nature, with Kingdom Hearts themed instrumentals and lyrics referring to anime, Steven Universe, and hentai. The EP was also credited as the start of Uzi's affiliation with the ""emo-rapper"" label due to the heartbreak-associated lyrics on the song ""Luv Scars K.o 1600"" and references to threats of suicide and depression on the stand-out track ""XO Tour Llif3"".

""XO Tour Llif3"" got significant popularity on SoundCloud, resulting in Uzi playing it live on the European leg of The Weeknd's tour, and the following week the song was added to streaming services and released as an official single. On April 4, 2017, ""Xo Tour Llif3"" debuted on Billboard Hot 100 at number 49 and peaked at number 7, becoming the rapper's highest charting song and biggest song, being certified 6x platinum as of August 2018.

""Luv Is Rage 2"" was delayed again on April 2, 2017, with Uzi blaming it on DJ Drama. On April 9, Don Cannon confirmed the project wasn't getting released ""any time soon"" and confirmed that ""XO Tour Llif3"" would be on the album. Uzi was featured on fellow rapper Playboi Carti's single ""wokeuplikethis*"", released on April 7. The single was performed by the pair at Coachella 2017.

The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart, with 135,000 album-equivalent units, and has since been certified platinum. The album also created ten Billboard Hot 100 charting singles, with two of them, ""The Way Life Goes"" and ""Sauce It Up"", becoming singles. During british singer Ed Sheeran's set at the Video Music Awards, Uzi Vert and Sheeran performed a medley of ""XO Tour Llif3"" and Sheeran's chart-topping single, ""Shape Of You"".

In September 2017, Woods teased a possible sequel project to ""Lil Uzi Vert vs The World"", possibly titled ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World 2"", and a collaboration project with Playboi Carti titled ""16*29"". In October, a joint tour with Playboi Carti called the ""16*29 tour"" was announced, further promoting the possibility of a collaboration project. The tour was canceled shortly thereafter due to Uzi claiming he needed to ""focus"". In October 2017, Uzi headlined Power 105.1's annual Powerhouse music celebration alongside The Weeknd, Migos, and Cardi B, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Uzi was also featured on Canadian rapper Nav's platinum-certified single ""Wanted You"". The song was released on November 3, 2017.

In January 2018, Uzi announced that he had completed a mixtape with record producer Wheezy. In May 2018, Don Cannon confirmed that a new Uzi project was dropping that year and speculation arose in July 2018 when Uzi tweeted the words ""Eternal Atake"", the title of their second studio album, pinning the tweet and announcing it was ""coming soon"", then at the end of the month sharing the then-chosen cover art for the project. The art referenced the logo of the cult Heavens Gate. The two members who survived the cult suggested that legal actions could be taken against Uzi for copying the logo style.

The art was the source of a threat from the remaining members of the organization over a legal attack. The then-thought lead single for the album, ""New Patek"" was released on September 18, 2018. Uzi was then featured on Lil Pump's single, ""Multi Millionaire"". The single was released on October 5, 2018.

In April 2019, following label trouble with Generation Now, it was announced that Uzi was now signed to Roc Nation. Two new promotional singles were released in April 2019, titled ""Sanguine Paradise"" and ""That's a Rack"", originally thought to be from their highly anticipated studio album, ""Eternal Atake"".

On December 13, 2019, Uzi released a new single titled ""Futsal Shuffle 2020"", which is the lead single of ""Eternal Atake"". The rapper then released the second single of the album, ""That Way"", on March 1, 2020.

""Eternal Atake"" was released on March 6, 2020, with a sole guest appearance from American singer Syd. ""New Patek"", ""That's a Rack"" and ""Sanguine Paradise"" did not appear on the album. ""Eternal Atake"" debuted atop the Billboard 200.

On March 12, 2020, Lil Uzi teased that the deluxe version of ""Eternal Atake"" and the sequel to their 2016 mixtape, ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World"", titled ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World 2"", would be released the following day, the date fans expected the release date of the original album.

The deluxe edition would have fourteen new tracks, featuring guest appearances from Chief Keef, 21 Savage, Future, Young Thug, Gunna, Lil Durk, Young Nudy, and Nav. The first half of the album maintained a leading number 1 position with 400 million streams in early 2020. This marked the largest streaming count for any album since 2018, when Lil Wayne's twelfth studio album, ""Tha Carter V"", got 433 million streams.

On April 24, 2020, Lil Uzi Vert released a new single titled ""Sasuke"". On July 10, Lil Uzi appeared on the remix of StaySolidRocky's ""Party Girl"". On July 21, Lil Uzi and Future hinted at an upcoming joint project titled ""Pluto x Baby Pluto"" on their social medias; it was released on November 13, 2020, and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200.

Anderson began his music career in 2007 and gained popularity in 2010 with his third mixtape Finally Famous Vol. 3: Big. He then signed a recording contract with GOOD Music and Def Jam Recordings and released his debut studio album, Finally Famous in 2011, which included the US top 10 single ""Dance (Ass)"" (featuring Nicki Minaj). Anderson followed it with his second album, Hall of Fame, while his third album, Dark Sky Paradise, debuted atop the US Billboard 200. It also included the hit singles ""I Don't Fuck with You"" (featuring E-40) and ""Blessings"" (featuring Drake). His fourth album, I Decided, contained ""Bounce Back"", his highest-charting US single, while his fifth album Detroit 2 was his third consecutive platinum album.

His debut album, Finally Famous, was released in June 2011 and featured guest appearances from hip hop superstars Kanye West, Chris Brown, Pharrell Williams, The-Dream, Wiz Khalifa, and Lupe Fiasco.

He was raised by his mother and grandparents who worked steadfastly to instill in him the principles of hard work and determination. Sean attended the Detroit Waldorf School, a school of art, from Kindergarten to 8th Grade where he was in 102.7FM, a local radio station in Detroit where he displayed his rhyming skills weekly. There, he met Kanye West after a radio interview in 2005 and got a chance to display his talent by freestyling for Mr. West, giving him a copy of his music and sending numerous tracks for him to critique. After months of submitting songs and numerous meetings, Sean finally got a call from Kanye West himself saying that he wanted to sign him. Two years later, West signed Big Sean to GOOD Music. Sean has cited West, Eminem, The Notorious B.I.G., and J Dilla as his influences.

On September 30, 2007, Big Sean released his first official mixtape Finally Famous: The Mixtape. His hit single, ""Get'cha Some"", produced by WrighTrax, attained media attention and led to articles in The Source and the Detroit Metro Times. He also recorded a music video for ""Get'cha Some"", which was directed by Hype Williams. Sean released a second mixtape hosted by Mick Boogie on April 16, 2009, called UKNOWBIGSEAN. It featured the songs ""Million Dollars"", ""Get'cha Some"" and ""Supa Dupa"". This mixtape includes 30 tracks. Sean released a third mixtape hosted by Don Cannon on August 31, 2010, called Finally Famous Vol. 3: BIG, which features include major artists like Bun B, Chip tha Ripper, Curren$y, Tyga, Drake, Mike Posner, Chuck Inglish, Asher Roth, Dom Kennedy, and Chiddy Bang. The mixtape includes 20 tracks.

Finally Famous, Sean's debut studio album, was released June 28, 2011, and spawned three hit singles; ""My Last"", ""Marvin & Chardonnay"" and ""Dance (Ass)"". The album featured guest appearances from Lupe Fiasco, John Legend, Pharrell, Kanye West, Roscoe Dash, Wiz Khalifa, Chiddy Bang, Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj, Pusha T, and included production from No I.D., The Legendary Traxster, Andrew ""Pop"" Wansel, Xaphoon Jones and The Neptunes. When the songs ""O.T.T.R."" and ""Flowers"" were leaked in July 2011, speculation began of a new mixtape. Sean confirmed in an interview on June 28, 2011, that a collaborative mixtape between him and ""two other guys in hip-hop that are just killing it right now"" will be released ""in a couple of weeks"". Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y were the suspected featured rappers on the mixtape. However, Wiz Khalifa later confirmed that there would be no mixtape, claiming that the songs were created, ""just for fun"".

In September 2011, Big Sean confirmed in an interview with the Daily Tribune that he'll be working on his second album during the I Am Finally Famous Tour and plans to release the album sometime in 2012. On October 19, 2011, Kanye West announced on his Twitter plans for a Spring 2012 GOOD Music album release. On April 6, 2012, ""Mercy"", the lead single from the GOOD Music compilation album, Cruel Summer, was released. The song, produced by newly signed in-house producer Lifted, features Big Sean along with Kanye West, Pusha T, and southern rapper 2 Chainz. Big Sean then announced his fourth mixtape would be titled ""Detroit"" and would serve as a lead-in to his second studio album. He then began promoting the mixtape, releasing short versions of the songs on his YouTube page. On September 5, 2012, Big Sean released the mixtape Detroit which features guest appearances from fellow rappers J. Cole, Juicy J, King Chip, French Montana, Royce da 5'9"", Kendrick Lamar, and Tyga.

Big Sean pushed back the release date of his second studio album Hall of Fame which was eventually released on August 27, 2013. The album has skits to give it a ""classic feel"", and includes features from multiple artists, including Lil Wayne, Miguel, and Nas. The album's production was primarily handled by No I.D., and Key Wane along with additional production from Hit-Boy, Da Internz, Mike Dean, Travis Scott, Xaphoon Jones, and Young Chop among others. Big Sean also stated in an interview that he was in the studio with fellow Detroit native Eminem. Sean went on to say they made a ""Detroit classic"" but he is unsure if it will be on Hall of Fame because of ""timing issues"". Hall of Fame spawned five singles, ""Guap"", ""Switch Up"" featuring Common, ""Beware"" featuring Jhené Aiko and Lil Wayne, ""Fire"", and ""Ashley"" featuring Miguel.

A month prior to the release of Hall of Fame, Big Sean told Complex that he had already begun work on his third album due to the inspiration from his new relationship. On September 12, 2014, Big Sean announced that he had signed a management deal with Roc Nation.

In December 2018, Big Sean in partnership with Ally Financial, Thurgood Marshall College Fund & the Sean Anderson Foundation, created an annual scholarship competition for HBCU students called “Moguls in the Making.”

On March 25, 2016, Big Sean released a track to celebrate his 28th birthday, ""Get My Shit Together"". Two days later he announced a self-titled album with Jhené Aiko, Twenty88, scheduled to be released on April 1, 2016, exclusively on Tidal. The album was released on April 5, 2016, on Apple Music and Spotify. A week after the exclusive release of Twenty88 on Tidal, Big Sean and Aiko released a 15-minute short film called Out of Love, which is composed of several recordings from the album.

On September 17, 2020, Big Sean revealed in a Reddit AMA that another Twenty88 album is ""in the works"". A track attributed to the project appeared on Detroit 2. He has also announced that he plans on launching his own record label. On October 29, 2021, Big Sean announced on Twitter that after 14 years, he has stepped away from Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Music label, saying ""That's a forever brotherhood, but business-wise, I had to start getting a bigger cut! I worked my way out that deal."" West also claimed during a November 2021 Drink Champs podcast that signing Sean was the 'worst decision' of his entire career.

Starting in 2020, Big Sean has appeared in the Showtime series 'Twenties' in a recurring role as Trsitan, an anti-social media character who learns the value of online connection. In October 2021, Big Sean, in collaboration with rapper and producer Hit-Boy released an EP entitled What You Expect.

In September 2022, Big Sean re-released Detroit to streaming platforms, in honor of its 10th anniversary.

In 2019, the foundation partnered with Boys & Girls Club of Southeastern Michigan, donating a second $100,000 recording studio to the club during that year's D.O.N. Weekend.

104,104,nsqk,64543,6779849,"Nacido en Monterrey, Nuevo León (México) y criado en Houston, Texas (Estados Unidos de América), Rodrigo Torres de la Garza, mejor conocido como NSQK (Nesquick), es un productor y cantante que mezcla notas de los géneros Pop, Rap, R&B, Rock y EDM para crear música con la intención de romper barreras de géneros y temas.

Es co-fundador y miembro del colectivo regiomontano No Pedí Permiso, forma parte del dúo de música pop-urbana Southboys y más recientemente, comienza su carrera solista.

El 31 de enero de 2020 lanzó su EP debut Botánica, un trabajo brutalmente honesto que habla de las altas y bajas de una relación amorosa y los sentimientos que implican éstas; como los celos, enojo, amor, tristeza y el poder aceptar que uno se siente vulnerable. Lanzó varios sencillos con diversos artistas emergentes como Cesxr, Riosse, Nicole Horts, Noa Sainz, Daaz y Absa G. Aunque la carrera de NSQK es aún es muy corta, la cantidad de material con el que cuenta es amplia, pues en 2021 lanzo dos EPs llamados Braille junto a Mene, y Brailluxe, siendo este último únicamente de tres sencillos donde uno de ellos cuenta con la colaboración de Tino el Pingüino.

A finales del 2022 se realizó el lanzamiento oficial de ROY, que tardó alrededor de tres años en producirse. Parte de experiencias personales de la vida de Rodrigo pero también de la idea de que no hay experiencias únicas, ya que en diversas ocasiones todos hemos llegado a tener un sentimiento o vivencia similar. ROY viene con una propuesta sumamente más personal que se puede notar en los beats o en las letras de las canciones al regresar un poco a sus orígenes para recordarnos a Botánica, aquel EP donde Rodri se presentaba en solitario, ya que si había una colaboración, la idea o el discurso inicial que se estaba buscando podría perderse un poco y no sería tan personal como en un inicio. Esto nos permite ver a un NSQK un poco más maduro, alineado a sus gustos considerando que esto es mucho mejor y auténtico en cuando a esa esencia propia por la música electrónica. 

En este material se trató de buscar referencias plásticas tanto para las portadas de los sencillos como la del disco que lograran hacer esa alusión al sentimiento de cada canción como lo podemos ver en “Cuando me vaya” haciendo referencia a 'Iván el Terrible y su Hijo', de Ilia Repin o la portada del disco que tiene una gran referencia a 'El Ángel Caído', de Alexandre Cabanel. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Nsqk"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

108,108,system of a down,5002314,381926550,"System of a Down is an Armenian American metal band, formed in 1994 in Los Angeles, California, USA. All four members are of Armenian descent, and are widely known for their views expressed in many of their songs confronting the Armenian Genocide of 1915 by the Ottoman Empire and the ongoing War on Terror by the US government. The band consists of Serj Tankian (vocals), Daron Malakian (vocals, guitar), Shavo Odadjian (bass, vocals) and John Dolmayan (drums).
System of a Down has achieved commercial success with five albums, and many singles such as their breakout hit ""Chop Suey!"", ""Toxicity"", ""Aerials"", ""B.Y.O.B."", ""Question!"", ""Hypnotize"" and ""Lonely Day"". Their works have earned them one Grammy Award amongst three nominations.

The band has been influenced by heavy metal, punk rock and Armenian folk.

System of a Down went on hiatus in 2006, with Serj Tankian pursuing a solo career and Daron Malakian and John Dolmayan forming Scars on Broadway. Shavo joined together with RZA from the Wu-Tang clan to form Hip-Hop group Achozen.

System of a Down is a part of the Axis of Justice, a non-profit organization formed by band member Serj Tankian (along with Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine), dedicated to bringing together musicians, music fans, and grassroots political organizations to fight for social justice.

Soil (1993–1995)
The roots of System of a Down lie in the band Soil (not to be confused with the current band SOiL), a group from Los Angeles that included Serj Tankian on vocals/keyboard, and Daron Malakian on vocals/guitar, as well as Dave Hakopyan (Bassist for Mt. Helium) on bass and Domingo Laranio (Local Hawaii Drummer) on drums. Shavo Odadjian joined Soil near their end as a guitarist. After three years, only one live show, and one jam session recording, the band split up.

In the beginning (1995–1997)
After Soil split up, Serj and Daron formed a new band, System of a Down, based on a poem that Daron wrote. The poem's title was ""Victims of the Down"", but Shavo Odadjian, who was originally the band's manager and promoter, didn't like the word and thought the word ""System"" sounded better. Ever since Shavo joined as bassist, managerial duties have been undertaken by the Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group and founder David ""Beno"" Benveniste. The band then found a drummer, Andy Khachaturian. System of a Down quickly made what is known as their early Untitled 1995 Demo Tape, which had very early recordings of ""Mr. Jack"" (called ""PIG""), along with songs called ""Flake"", ""Toast"" and an early recording of ""The Metro"", a cover of the Berlin song of the same name. It is rumored that there are other tapes made, which contain early recordings of ""Friik"", ""36"" (called "".36""), and ""Roulette"". Two other songs, ""X"" (called ""Multiply"") and ""Honey"" were live demos at the time and were played at very early shows. After this, the band recorded Demo Tape 1, which had early versions of ""Sugar"", ""Suite-Pee"", and ""P.L.U.C.K."", as well as ""Dam."" Demo Tape 2 was released in 1996 and had a rough demo of the song ""Soil"" as well as the most known unreleased tracks such as ""Honey"" and ""Temper."" At the beginning of 1997, SOAD recorded their final publicly-released demo tape, Demo Tape 3, which had rough versions of ""Peephole"", ""War?"", and ""Know."" In mid 1997, Ontronik Khachaturian left the band due to a hand injury. Soon after playing at the Whisky-A-Go-Go and Viper Room with new drummer John Dolmayan, producer Rick Rubin caught the band's attention and told them to keep in touch with him. Showing great interest, they recorded Demo Tape 4 near the end of that year. This demo, however, was made only to be sent to record companies. The tape was not released to the public until years later when it was leaked onto the Internet. After Rick helped them get signed onto American/Columbia Records, SOAD began to record in his studio. In 1997 SOAD won the Best Signed Band award from the Rock City Awards. Prior to 1998, SOAD's live shows were called ""The Dark Red Experience"".

Debut album (1998–2000)
In the summer of 1998, System of a Down released their debut album, System of a Down. They enjoyed moderate success with their first single ""Sugar"" becoming a radio favorite, followed by the single ""Spiders"". After the release of the album, System of a Down toured extensively, opening for Slayer before making their way to the second stage of Ozzfest. Following Ozzfest, they toured with Fear Factory and Incubus before headlining the Sno-Core tour with Puya, Mr. Bungle, The Cat and Incubus providing support. System was scheduled to play the 1999 Family Values Tour, but were kicked off by Fred Durst over his inability to sign the band Taproot. Fred Durst has since admitted that he was a ""complete wanker"" in relation to this ""oversight"". The band have yet to comment on Durst's involvement or commentary. In 2000, the group contributed their cover of the Black Sabbath song ""Snowblind"" to the Sabbath tribute album Nativity in Black 2.

Toxicity, Steal This Album! (2001–2003)
The group's big break arrived when their second album Toxicity debuted at #1 on the American and Canadian charts, eventually achieving multi-platinum certification. The album has since sold 6 million copies worldwide. It was still on top in America on the week of the September 11, 2001 attacks and the political environment caused by the attacks added to the controversy surrounding their hit single ""Chop Suey!"" causing it to be taken off the radio as it contained politically sensitive lyrics at the time such as ""(I don't think you) trust in my self-righteous suicide."" Regardless, the video gained constant play on MTV as did the second single, ""Toxicity"". Even with the controversy surrounding ""Chop Suey!"" which earned a Grammy nomination, System of a Down still received constant airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with ""Toxicity "" and ""Aerials"". In May 2006, VH1 listed Toxicity in the #14 slot in the 40 Greatest Metal Songs.

In 2001, the band went on tour with Slipknot in the United States and Mexico. After seeing the success of the tour, System and Slipknot went on a Pledge of Allegiance Tour with Rammstein in 2002. In late 2001, a few unreleased tracks made their way onto the Internet. The group released a statement that the tracks were unfinished material. Soon after, the band released the final versions of the songs, which were recorded at the same time, but hadn't been used for Toxicity. The result was Steal This Album!, released in November 2002. Steal This Album! resembled a burnable CD that was marked with a felt-tip marker. 50,000 special copies of the album with different CD designs were also released, each designed by a different member of the band. The name of the album is a reference to Abbie Hoffman's counter-culture book, Steal This Book and as a message to those who stole the songs and released them on the Internet. ""Steal This Album was the lowest rated album that we had ever made"" Dolmayan said in an interview. The song ""Innervision"" was released as a promo single and received constant airplay on alternative radio. A video for ""Boom!"" was filmed with director Michael Moore as a protest against the War in Iraq.

Mezmerize / Hypnotize (2004–2005)
From 2004 to 2005, the group produced a double album, Mezmerize/Hypnotize with the two parts released six months apart. The first album, Mezmerize, was released on May 17, 2005, to favorable reviews by critics. It debuted at #1 in the United States, Canada, Australia and all around the world, making it System of a Down's second #1 album. First week sales rocketed to over 800,000 copies worldwide. The Grammy Award-winning single ""B.Y.O.B."", which questions the integrity of war, worked its way up the Billboard Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts. The next single, ""Question!"" was released with Shavo Odadjian co-directing the music video. Following the release of Mezmerize, the band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada with The Mars Volta and Bad Acid Trip supporting.

The second part of the double album, Hypnotize, was released on November 22, 2005. Like Mezmerize, it debuted at #1 in the US, making System of a Down, along with the Beatles, Guns 'N Roses, and rappers 2Pac and DMX, the only artists to ever have two studio albums debut at #1 in the same year.

In February 2006, the band won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance for ""B.Y.O.B."", beating out other established artists such as Nine Inch Nails and Robert Plant. Their second single off the Hypnotize album, ""Lonely Day"" was released in March in the United States. System of a Down released ""Kill Rock 'N Roll"" and ""Vicinity of Obscenity"" as their next promo singles. The band headlined Ozzfest 2006 in cities where tour founder Ozzy Osbourne opted not to appear or wasn't playing on the main stage. These shows turned out to be the bands last performances together to date.

Hiatus and Future (2006–present)
In May 2006, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Daron Malakian has confirmed the break will probably last a few years, but it was Shavo who in an interview with Guitar magazine said it will last at least 3 years, but insists that the band would not be splitting up. He told MTV, ""We're not breaking up. If that was the case, we wouldn't be doing this Ozzfest. We're going to take a very long break after Ozzfest and do our own things. We've done System for over ten years, and I think it's healthy to take a rest.""

During their performance in Houston, Texas, Malakian also took a moment to say, ""There's been a lot of rumors about us breaking up. Well, don't listen to them. Us four right here, we will always be System of a Down!"" However, Malakian announced he was forming a band called Scars on Broadway, which has since been joined by Dolmayan, and will work on its debut album during autumn. Odadjian will be working on a project with RZA of Wu-Tang Clan named Achozen as well as his UrSession website/record label. Tankian plans to keep recording as a solo artist/producer with his first single being Empty Walls off his first album Elect the Dead which was released on October 23, 2007, while Dolmayan, on top of Scars on Broadway, plans to open a comic book store online, which should be up online in November 2007.

System of a Down's final performance before their hiatus took place on August 13, 2006 in West Palm Beach, Florida, as part of the 2006 Ozzfest Festival. ""Tonight will be the last show we play for a long time together"", Malakian told the crowd during Sunday's last performance. ""We'll be back. We just don't know when."" It was stated by Sharon Osbourne that System of a Down was paid ""about $325,000 a show.""

System of a Down's songs were used in the 2006 film ""Screamers"" by Carla Garapedian. ""Screamers"" debuted in theaters in large city markets such as New York City, Detroit, Washington D.C., San Francisco, Fresno, Providence, and Boston. An earlier engagement started exclusively in Los Angeles on , 2006.

System of a Down was honored at the USC v. Cal game at the Los Angeles Coliseum in Los Angeles, CA in 2006. The Spirit of Troy also known as the Trojan Marching Band performed three System of a Down songs. The marching band was honored to play ""Toxicity"", ""Sugar"", and Hypnotize"" along with John Dolmayan and Shavo Odadjian.

Tankian recently said that he has wanted to work on his ""solo record for years"". As for the future of the band, he said that he does not know whether System of a Down is over or not. He also stated that ""maybe in a few years"" the band would ""want to make another album. It's impossible to tell right now. It'll be later down the line; then we'll be able to tell what might happen.""

Bassist Shavo Odadjian was recently revealed to be directing the first video for the comeback of the hardcore punk band, Bad Brains.

For the 2007 Grammys, System of a Down was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance for ""Lonely Day"", but lost to Wolfmother and their song ""Woman"".

Shavo Odadjian recently told Launch Radio Networks that System of a Down is ""alive and well"".
“We're just not working together right now. We kind of like split up at first, but you know, we're brothers, man, we'll take bullets for each other. So it's like, you kind of miss each other after a while and you, one guy makes the first move, then another starts making phone calls….this is a juggernaut, man. System of a Down is my lifeline. It'll never go away. We could not make a record for 10 years — that's not gonna happen, but I'm just saying we could — and we'll come back strong.”

Future and possible Reunion
When asked in February 2008 if a reunion was planned any time in the future, Daron Malakian had admitted that System of a Down may never get back together again. He had this to say: “There's no talk of System doing anything. We're not planning on doing anything. If anyone's holding their breath for a System record, they're going to turn blue and pass out. It's a long ways away, if it ever even happens. We don't even talk about it - none of us. This (Scars on Broadway) is my band right now.”

On September 14, 2007 an American TV interview video with Shavo Odadjian was posted online, and subsequently embedded on the MySpace profile of his current working band, Achozen. He commented on System of a Down's status and future, saying: “We're taking a break. It got to a point where we we're kinda…not implode but like, y'know, I saw something and … Thirteen years of non stop y'know, so- and we all have things we wanna do… Everyone and their mother wants to say that we are breaking up, that we broke up. It's like, everyone talks to me 'Oh you guys broke up' no we didn't break up, why d'ya want us to brea- you want us to break up, we'll break up!”

In a September 13, 2007 interview, frontman Serj Tankian offered his take on the band's future by saying: ""It's very simple. System of a Down, we've been a band for 11 years, or 12 years. We've put out five records, we're all friends. We're still friends. And we decided to take time to pursue our own artistic and personal goals. And unlike a company like Nabisco that puts out crackers every year, or cookies every year, we're artists, we're friends. So we don't have to necessarily do things the same way every year. So we took time to do our own things and we left the door open. We're all friends. If we ever want to get together and speak to the world as System of a Down, then we will. If not, then we'll…the door is open.”

When asked if there could be a possible reunion one day, he responded by saying: ""It's very possible"".

In an April 2008 interview with Kerrang magazine, guitarist Daron Malakian and drummer John Dolmayan (who have recently formed a side project known as Scars on Broadway) gave their takes on the bands future. When told that many people are going to wonder what the future of the band is, Malakian responded by stating that: ""We'll all know when the time is right"". Dolmayan added: ""It'll just happen"". Malakian went on to say: “Yeah. It'll feel good and happen. I can respect this situation (System's hiatus) more than I can respect the situation where two people are like, 'The lead singer fucked my girlfriend!' and that kind of bullshit. Nah, man. The lead singer is a special person to me and I am to him. And that's how we ended off. Same with Shavo, same with John. And it will always be. It was a big part of my life. We were onstage together for a long time, man. We went through shit as a band and friends – we slept in RVs together!”

In an interview with Tankian about Big Day Out 2009 (a show which involved playing his Elect the Dead album live with the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra, and a few songs from his then-upcoming second studio album) Tankian stated, ""Every few months I am honored to hear interesting rumors about whether the band is going to tour or break up permanently. I find them all to be very entertaining.""

On October 31, 2009, Odadjian threw a Halloween party at the Roxy during which he, Malakian, and Dolmayan performed ""Suite-Pee"" (off System of a Down), Scars on Broadway's ""They Say,"" and an unknown song. This performance was followed by another partial reunion of the band on November 20, 2009, at the Avalon in Hollywood during which Malakian, Dolmayan, and Odadjian played ""Aerials"" and ""Toxicity.""

Reunion (2011)
On Monday, November 29th, 2010, System of a Down announced on their website that they would reform for a string of large European festival dates in June 2011. Among the announced tour dates included UK's Download Festival, Switzerland's Greenfield Festival, Germany's Rock am Ring/Rock im Park and Sweden's Metaltown festivals. In their reunion statement posted on their website, the band was unclear as to the extent of their reformation. It read, ""We have no master plan of sorts – we are playing these shows simply because we want to play together again as a band and for you, our amazing fans.""

From late February to early March 2012, they headlined five dates at Soundwave festival. This was the band's first visit to Australia since 2005. The band have continued playing around the world.

Durk is best known for his involvement in the drill wave that took the music world by storm in the 2010s. He is the founder of his own record label, Only the Family (OTF).

Durk’s early career was, like many drill artists, plagued with legal issues and accusations of violence. These issues eventually led to his shows being canceled.

In 2012, his career took off with the release of “L’s Anthem” and its French Montana-featuring remix. In 2013, he continued his hot streak with “Dis Ain’t What U Want,” a conscious reflection on his perception in the media and throughout his city. In 2015, he released his debut studio album Remember My Name and the viral sensation, “My Beyoncé” with DeJ Loaf.

Between 2016 and 2020, Durk went on to drop several new installments of his series Signed to the Streets and Just Cause Y’all Waited. At the same time, he faced renewed legal challenges stemming from an Atlanta shooting. Regardless of the circumstances, he persisted, gaining yet another viral hit as a feature on Drake’s “Laugh Now Cry Later.” He also gained traction with the Lil Baby and Polo G assisted “3 Headed Goat.”

The scars of violence run deep in Durk’s discography, particularly stemming from the loss of OTF members Nunu (Nuski) and King Von at the hands of gunfire. Both artists are memorialized on his album The Voice, for which a deluxe version was released in 2021. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Durk"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Originally the group started as family, who all had an interest in music.

T​he group later released another mixtape titled ""No Label"" in 2012, which featured ""Bando"", a track that was​ soon labeled a ""dope-boy anthem"". 

In 2013, Migos released their breakout single ""Versace"". The single was produced by Zaytoven and peaked at number 99 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Later that year, Canadian rapper Drake brought the single more recognition when he remixed the song, adding a verse, which he would later perform at the 2013 iHeartRadio Music Festival. On June 13, Migos released their mixtape Y.R.N. (Young Rich N***as), which features the lead single ""Versace"", to critical acclaim. Brandon Soderberg of Spin gave it 8 out of 10 stars, commenting that it ""is a super-cut of Dirty South vibes"" and compared the three members to Gucci Mane, Soulja Boy, and Future.

On June 15, 2013, the group performed at rap radio station Hot 107.9's Birthday Bash. In October 2013, the group was featured in XXL's section ""Show & Prove"". ""Versace"" was placed in multiple year-end lists of 2013, including number three on XXL's ""The 25 Best Songs of 2013"", number four on Complex's ""The 50 Best Songs of 2013"", number five on SPIN's ""50 Best Songs of 2013,"" number 38 on Pitchfork's ""The Top 100 Tracks of 2013"" and number 69 on Rolling Stone's ""The 100 Best Songs of 2013.""

Migos released their debut album Yung Rich Nation in July 2015, through Quality Control Music and 300 Entertainment. Their second album, Culture, was released in January 2017 also through both record labels, and debuted atop the US Billboard 200 chart. The group later signed a deal with Motown and Capitol Records in February 2017, and followed up the latter album with Culture II in January 2018, giving the group their second number one album in the United States. 

On October 28, 2016, Migos released the first single of their new album Culture. The single was titled ""Bad and Boujee"". The song was produced by Metro Boomin and features vocals from fellow American rapper Lil Uzi Vert. The music video for the single was released on October 31. The single went on to top the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Migos' first number one single in the US. Their second album, Culture, was released on January 27, 2017. In April 2017, Migos were featured on Katy Perry  song ""Bon Appétit"" from her fifth studio album, Witness.

The album contains twenty-four tracks, featuring production from Metro Boomin, Dun Deal, Murda Beatz, Travis Scott, Zaytoven and others.

In October 2018, Quavo stated that Culture III would be released in early 2019. The album was then delayed and re-scheduled for release in early 2020. However, the album was pushed back again, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Quavo spoke to Billboard in March 2020, and announced the group's decision to hold off on the release of Culture III, explaining it was largely due to their inability to properly roll out the album once social distancing rules went into effect in most states in the US. Instead, the group will first release Quarantine Mixtape in the lead-up to Culture III. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Migos"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was at that time that they decided to use Spanish to communicate their impressions and ideas.
 
The current composition of RØNIN was completed in early 2006 when Gero left the band and Alberto (aka Pan) became the band's new bass player. Alberto had played in many Indie-Alternative bands before such as SMILE or CATFOOD.

136,136,freddie gibbs,1051214,77479526,"Freddie Tipton (born June 14, 1982 in Gary, Indiana), better known as Freddie Gibbs, is an American rapper who became popular after being included in XXL Magazine's ten Freshmen of 2010. He was previously signed to Interscope Records before being let go from his deal without an official record being released. He has released five mixtapes since his first in 2005 including Live From Gary, Indiana, Big Bizness, The Miseducation of Freddie Gibbs, midwestgangstaboxframecadillacmuzik and Str8 Killa No Filla. The Str8 Killa EP was released 3rd August. His debut LP Baby-Faced Killa and The Devil's Palace, a collaborative project with The Alchemist, were both released in 2012. He then would go on to release Cold Day in Hell in 2012, and ESGN in 2013. In 2014, Gibbs released Pinata, a collaborative album with producer Madlib, and The Tonite Show, another collaborative album with The World's Freshest. Gibbs newest album Shadow of a Doubt is planned to best released on November 20th via ESGN / EMPIRE.

Hailing from Gary, Indiana, a place whose murder and crime rates have ranked it several times at the top of the ""Most Dangerous Cities"" list, Freddie Gibbs is the true definition of a street survivor. Raised on Gary's east side, Gibbs lived the hard life firsthand in a run-down industrial community plagued with vice and ignored by the establishment. After playing at Ball State on a football scholarship, Gibbs was kicked out of college. Over the next few years he went through court-ordered boot camp, joined and got discharged from the military, and held down a series of 9 to 5 jobs without success. Feeling like the system had failed him, Gibbs turned to hustling; pimping and selling crack out of a local house. Inspired by rappers like UGK, The Geto Boys, and 2Pac, Gibbs started rhyming about his life and the issues facing urban youth in Gary and the countless other impoverished cities just like it.  Gibbs is the first rapper signed to a major label from Gary.

The Steel City's most famous musical residents to date are the Jackson 5, whose name still adorns a marquee on a falling-apart theater in Gary's blighted downtown. His desire to rep the Midwest and his city led Gibbs to start recording mixtapes and pushing them online as well as the streets, where he quickly began garnering fans drawn to his original style, diverse flows, and deeply personal lyrics about his experience as a young black man growing up below the poverty line in a forgotten American city. 

Freddie has worked with respected producers like Madlib, Red Spyda, Just Blaze, Buckwild, the Alchemist, Polow Da Don, and Collipark among many others. Gibbs cites Houston rap and Pac as his major influences, and it shows in his ability to alternate between chillingly tense street stories of violence and laid back comedic tales about women and weed. Ultimately Gibbs shows and proves with his rhymes, which demonstrate the promise of a legend in the making. His skills, wit, and street credibility establish Freddie Gibbs as a true artist. He's ready to represent for Gary, the Midwest, and anyone who relates to the struggle of inner city life. As Gibbs tells it: ""My music is definitely on some gangsta shit. That's what I was raised on and what I witnessed. How can I speak on anything else?""

The mixtape charted at #7 on the Heatseekers Albums chart on Billboard and contained the singles ""I'm Sorry"", ""Ultrasound"", ""Just Like You"" and ""Winter Blues"". Ever since 2016, Lucas has also become known for remixing popular hip hop songs.

On November 28, 2017, Lucas released the single ""I'm Not Racist"" via his YouTube channel. The music video quickly went viral and gained critical acclaim. The controversial song is about race and society, and race relations from the perspectives of a white man and a black man. The video was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Music Video at the 61st Grammy Awards, but lost to Childish Gambino's ""This Is America"". Lucas and Chris Brown announced a collaborative project titled Angels & Demons on February 25, 2018, with the project's first single ""Stranger Things"" releasing the following day. On April 1, 2018, Lucas released the single ""Frozen"", a song focused on different forms of reckless driving. The second single from the Angels and Demons collaborative mixtape, ""I Don't Die"", was released on May 2.

On July 31, 2018, Lucas announced that he was forced to cancel appearances in the Australian and European legs of his I'm Kind of a Big Deal tour due to hoarseness and laryngitis. A month later, Lucas was featured on ""Lucky You"" from Eminem's tenth album, Kamikaze. The song debuted at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Lucas' first top 10 entry on the chart. On October 12, 2018, Lucas announced that he would be releasing his debut studio album entitled ADHD. He also announced a single from the album that would be released the following Wednesday. The song, entitled ""I Love"", was released as the lead single from ADHD, which was released on March 27, 2020. It was preceded by nine singles from October 2018 to March 2020, the time before release.

On August 17, 2020, Lucas announced the release date of his debut EP, Evolution. It was released on October 23, 2020. It was preceded by two singles, ""Snitch"" and ""Fall Slowly"" featuring Ashanti.

Lucas has cited several artists as influences in his music, but he cites Eminem as his biggest musical influence. He also revealed he was influenced by Will Smith in his song ""Will"", which he would release a remix of featuring Will Smith himself on May 15, 2020. He cites Jay-Z as one of his influences too.

Joyner Lucas shares a son named Joyner Messiah Lucas (born February 20, 2016) with Carmen Julissa Ayala, whom he had an off and on romantic relationship with. Lucas tells the story of his son's conception in his song ""Forever"" on his mixtape 508-507-2209. Joyner Messiah Lucas is loved and adored by his father and referenced in many of his songs. He has also made cameos in his father's music videos. Most recently he played Will Smith's son Jaden Smith in the video of ""Will"".

Lucas has revealed that the title of his album ADHD comes from the fact that he was diagnosed with ADHD as a child. He explained that people surrounding him, including his own parents, made him feel like he was not normal and treated him differently as a result. Eventually, he would act out and get sent to an alternative school after expulsion.

Feuds

Logic

According to Lucas, when he was on Tech N9ne's tour bus, he heard some records from Tech's album The Storm. Lucas expressed interest on collaborating with Logic on the song ""Sriracha"" and felt that he could add to the display of fast-flow rapping, and Tech acquiesced. Logic was originally slated to be the only feature on ""Sriracha"", but when he spent over six months to deliver his verse, Lucas hopped on the track to offer his own. Joyner stated that when they got the record back, he could tell that Logic was not ""too happy"" about him being on the track once he heard it. On his remix of Future's ""Mask Off"", Joyner, unhappy by the work Logic turned in after taking nearly half a year to edit his verse, directly addressed the disappointing display. Both he and Tech N9ne were upset with Logic for not emulating the style of quick flow on the song.

After Logic's hit song ""1-800-273-8255"" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, Joyner Lucas immediately took offense and argued that the track was named in order to bring direct competition to his project, 508-507-2209. In a later interview, he called Logic ""corny"" and in another incident, he said that he thinks that Logic ""can rap"" but feels like ""he tries to prove that he's black too much for me."" With both Logic's single and Lucas' mixtape dealing with the issue of mental health representation and resource allocation, Lucas was careful to not slam the track too hard.

When Logic dropped his song ""Yuck"" from his mixtape Bobby Tarantino II in March 2018, the veiled diss inside the song was quickly spotted by Lucas and his fans, despite Logic saying that there was no diss in the song. Seemingly nonplussed by the insult, Lucas dared Logic to call him out directly on Twitter. That same month, Joyner took aim at Logic's song ""44 More"" and his album Everybody on his remix of BlocBoy JB's ""Look Alive"".

In 2019, the two rappers ended their feud, which was revealed when Logic made a guest appearance on Joyner Lucas' song ""ISIS"", the third single from ADHD. Lucas kept the name of the collaborator a secret until he released the song.

Hopsin

In September 2018, when a fan asked Los Angeles rapper Hopsin on Twitter who would win in a rap battle between him and Joyner Lucas, Hopsin replied, ""That's a dumb question that I'm sure you already know the answer to."" Not long after, Lucas commented, ""Hold up. @Hopsin wtf is that supposed to mean???"" In his response, Hopsin stated that he would ""b[r]eak his soul"" and also dissed Logic in the comment. This dispute would prove to be short-lived, when in less than two days Hopsin shared a screenshot of a FaceTime call with Lucas, indicating that they finally made peace, but still wanted people to consider who would beat the other in a rap battle. While the majority favored Hopsin, Lucas was adamant without arguing.

Tory Lanez

Joyner Lucas' feud with Canadian recording artist Tory Lanez began over matters similar to his beef with Hopsin. On November 19, 2018, Lanez claimed that he was a better rapper than Joyner Lucas on an Instagram Live session. Incredulous, Lucas immediately responded by inviting Lanez to a battle rapping challenge and telling him to let the public decide who is better. The next day, Lanez dropped a freestyle over Eminem's ""Lucky You"", of which Lucas made a guest appearance on. In less than 24 hours, Joyner responded with his freestyle over ""Litty"" by Meek Mill featuring Tory Lanez, also targeting rapper Trippie Redd, who joined Tory's Instagram Live and slandered Joyner's name as well. Shortly after, Lanez retaliated with his own freestyle of ""Litty"", titled ""Litty Again"", taking shots at Joyner's collaboration with Eminem. Lucas' answer song was a freestyle of Kodak Black's ""Zeze"". On the track, he mentions Tory's being accused of plagiarism in 2016, when listeners noticed that the ending of Lanez's song ""4am Flex"" was similar to Kendrick Lamar's ""The Art of Peer Pressure"". Joyner also accuses him of copying rapper Don Q's flow on his 2017 Funkmaster Flex freestyle. On November 23, Tory posted on Instagram a video of him declaring victory in the feud and celebrating. Displeased, Lucas reposted the video with his own comment, with a reference to Lanez as a singer.

The end of this rivalry was made public on August 8, 2019, when Joyner Lucas and Tory Lanez collaborated on their remix of ""Suge"" by DaBaby.

The Grammy Awards are held annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Joyner has two Grammy nominations altogether; one for Best Music Video for “I’m Not Racist” and one for Best Rap Song for “Lucky You” by Eminem.

159,159,bones,902374,106008837,"There are multiple artists that perform under the name 'Bones'. 

1. Elmo Kennedy O'Connor, an American rapper from Howell, Michigan.
2. A death metal band from Antwerp, Belgium.
3. A death metal band from Chicago. 
4. Michael Miller, a punk infused delta blues performance artist.
5. An alias of Julien Skrobek, an experimental HNW artist from France.
6. An experimental rock band from Huntington Beach, CA.

1. Elmo Kennedy O'Connor, known professionally as Bones, is an American rapper from Howell, Michigan. He is notable for the frenetic pace at which he releases new music, including over 40 mix tapes and 88 music videos since 2011, and his resistance to signing with a major record label or charging money for his music despite significant popularity and label interest. Born to a mother who designed clothing and a father who was a web designer. His grandfather was actor Robert Culp. When Bones was 7 years old, his family moved to Howell, Michigan. When he was 16, he dropped out of high school and moved to Los Angeles where his brother, Elliott, had already been living.

He has collaborated on three tracks with Raider Klan member Eddy Baker, including “High”, “Delinquents”, and “PayPal” off of Bones's albums Saturn (2013), Creep (2013), and Garbage (2014). Bones also performs and collaborates often with Xavier Wulf and another former Raider Klan member Chris Travis. Bones is 1 of the 4 members in the collective Seshollowaterboyz, which consists of Him (Bones), Xavier Wulf, Chris Travis, and Eddy Baker.

In 2014, Bones self-released 5 mixtapes through his label TeamSesh, including Garbage, which received coverage and critical acclaim from notable publications including The Fader, Pigeons & Planes, and RESPECT.
Bones headlined a sold out show at the House of Blues in Los Angeles on March 4, 2015. and opened for Shlohmo at The Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles on May 7, 2015. The hook from Bones' song ""Dirt"" was featured in ASAP Rocky's ""Canal St."" on the 2015 At. Long. Last. ASAP album.

On September 17, 2015, Bones performed ""Canal St."" with ASAP Rocky on the Jimmy Kimmel Live! show but was cut from the TV broadcast. Videos of the performance were made available online.  Bones and his manager Elliott O’Connor, who is also his brother, have both stated that major labels have shown interest in signing him but he has declined up to this point. According to Max Bell of LA Weekly, ""interested labels wanted him to be their 'white rapper,' an artist along the lines of Mac Miller and Machine Gun Kelly. But Bones wasn't interested in being remade.

2. Bones are a death metal band from Belgium, with two releases on Bandcamp, and an EP ""Gate Of Night"" out soon on Blood Harvest Records.  Lineup: Stef (guitars/vocals), Jeroen (lead guitars/vocals), Viktor (drums), Laurens (bass).

3. Bones are a 3-piece death metal punk band from Chicago, with two releases on Bandcamp and a third currently being recorded.  Originally members of the 90s thrash band Usurper, Bones compromises of Joe Warlord (drums), Carcass Chris (guitar), and Jon Necromancer (bass & vox).

4.  Part performance artist, part ego drenched rock star, Bones rips delta blues with punks intensity, and throws in a little stripper jazz for colour. With the delivery of a storefront preacher, The Man Named Bones (the alter ego of one Michael Miller) sings, screams and growls Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll with tongue firmly in cheek. Armed with an upright bass, an electric guitar, a sampler and a drum machine, Bones is a one man blues/punk machine.

5. Bones was an untitled noise project released on the French static noise / HNW label Slow Death Music, believed to by Julien Skrobek.

163,163,sage the gemini,511366,3741996,"Success doesn't come easily for anybody. Since day one, persistence has been the name of the game for Bay Area rapper Sage The Gemini.

When he made the decision to rap, nobody would help him. He’d bring rhymes to his peers for beats, and no one jumped at the chance to collaborate. So, he went even harder and he did everything himself. By the age of 14, he had taught himself how to create beats, produce, and even mix and master. He’d become a wholly self-sufficient artist before tenth grade. Now 21, he recalls, “All I cared about was music. I would stay up all night working on tracks and go to school tired. It didn’t matter. I wanted to be heard.”

Inspired by everyone from Chris Brown and Usher to Jay-Z and Pharrell, he studied various genres inside and out. That determination and dedication eventually yielded a viral sensation.

In 2008, he dropped his first online track ""You Should Know"" on MySpace. It became a viral hit, generating over three million views and buzzing amongst listeners worldwide. Joining up with the famed crew HBK Gang, the Bay Area began to embrace him as he performed countless gigs, developed a local presence, and honed a sound of his own.

""Musically, it's a mixture of everything,"" he explains. ""It's like going to McDonalds and pouring every drink in one cup. I want to start my own genre—like a crossover of R&B and Bay Area party hip-hop.""

That crossover revs up on ""Gas Pedal."" This smash hit switches lanes between a club-ready beat and a swaggering hook. Sage's smooth flow coasts alongside a slick verse from HBK's Iamsu.

He continues, ""It's a dancing song. I like to keep the violence to a minimum. Dancing helps kids in a big way that no one wants to pay attention to. If they're dancing, it's all good. I grew up listening to Iamsu. To have him on there is a blessing.""

The song attracted Republic Records who inked a deal with him in 2013. Then, as part of the EP of the same name, ""Gas Pedal"" sped toward the top online and at radio, reaching #5 on the Billboard Hip-Hop Chart and racking up over 12 million YouTube/VEVO views. At the same time, countless fans uploaded their own takes on the song to both YouTube and Vine, making the impact simply seismic. Cumulatively, there are over 110 million viral views fueled by this immense audience response without radio. It also serves as a gateway to his forthcoming full-length debut album for the label.

Another banger ""Red Nose"" wiggles from an unshakable chorus and a massive groove, becoming an anthem in its own right. It showcases just how clever he really is too. ""I wanted to say something that means 'ass-shaking' without simply saying it,"" he grins. ""That's where the comparison to a red nose pit bull came from.""

Ultimately though, everything about Sage stands out. Producing and writing, he architects his own vision completely from the music to the rhymes. Now, he's speeding towards the top.

""I want people to feel like they can live with me through the music,"" he concludes. ""It's about having a good time together. The album's going to have turn-up and party songs as well some more emotional moments. It's everything, and everyone is welcome along for the ride."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sage+the+Gemini"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He began his rap/hip hop career touring with 2 Live Crew and was then featured on DJ Khaled's album ""We The Best"" in 2006. He released his debut album Mail on Sunday in 2008 and it's lead single, Low featuring T-Pain, held a run of 10 weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Dillard was born in the 187th Street projects of Carol City, Florida. His single mother raised him and his seven sisters, some of whom sang in a local gospel group. As a teenager, Dillard worked with local rap group 2 Live Crew and formed his own amateur group with some friends called the Groundhoggz. His work with 2 Live Crew member Fresh Kid Ice attracted attention of DeVante Swing, a member of the band Jodeci. However, he was rejected by several of the major labels, so he sought many other jobs outside of music. After graduating from high school in 1998, he studied international business management at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas for two years and attended Barry University for two months. He returned to Florida to continue pursuing his music career after receiving a phone call from a representative of the independent label Poe Boy Entertainment. Dillard signed with Poe Boy in 2006, and as Flo Rida he began affiliating with other Florida rappers, such as Rick Ross, Trina, T-Pain, and Trick Daddy. A promotional street single entitled ""Birthday"", featuring Rick Ross, was his first significant release. He made his debut guest appearance with the song ""Bitch I'm from Dade County"" on DJ Khaled's album We the Best, which featured Trick Daddy, Trina, Rick Ross, Brisco, C-Ride, and Dre.

He formally went as ""Brahman"" with a blue character, as he believed the Indian god Kali Ma was blue, after realizing that Kali Ma is portrayed with black skin, he rebranded as Lil Darkie and changed his sound alongside with the new persona. The Brahman period lasted a significant amount of time and even had a Collective before the Collective he has as Darkie named ""Spider Gang"", the Brahman collective was named ""Native Cruiser Records"" or NCR for short, and consisted of early Brahman collaborators and Brahman himself.

Lil Darkie’s music is most noticeable due to his “cartoonish” personality both in his music and on social media. He grew a heavy following online through the app TikTok, with songs such as ""Haha"" and ""Genocide"" being very popular. 

Darkie himself admits that the songs that got him popular are not songs he would make today and is no longer something that fully defines Lil Darkie as a character. With the album release ""The Future Is Dark"", Darkie showed his experimental sound alongside common rap niches.

Though Lil Darkie is very misunderstood with his music; especially with Genocide and Holocaust, the messages within his songs are more hidden and complex to the people who want to assume and hate on him for thinking he is racist and wrongfully using the N-word. Even though the use of the N-word is pretty controversial, on the other hand, him being racist or homophobic, etc. isn't the case whereas in multiple songs or occasions in real life, he is open with his sexuality and his opinions on thinking everyone is equal while using the slur due to not thinking one race can claim the word when everyone shouldn't be divided based on preferences and his argument that is promoted is to only spread positivity even with the outrageous titles that people catch their view on.

At an early age of 14, Lone started working on his on music, creating his first songs at a recording studio at his school, where he met two of his best friends, Texaco and Nezzus, who would produce many of his early works and continue to work with him on later projects. His earliest official releases came in late 2015 and early 2016 on SoundCloud, including notable tracks like ""No Face, No Case,"" ""Drexler,"" and ""On Go."" 

His earliest known release was an EP called Lonely’s Flexed Up Slow Jams. Known only through a single screenshot available on his old label Gorgeous Records’s Instagram, the hollow shells of its now private SoundCloud pages and the confirmation of its existence in a 2024 interview with Nardwuar, this 3 song EP would see Destroy Lonely under the moniker of “nascar lone!”. Due to its limited availability, the EP is now considered lost media like most of his releases in this time period.

As he grew his fanbase and released more projects, Lonely forged relationships with many contemporaries in the Atlanta-area scene like BigSmokeChapo. He closely works with producer Clayco. He also frequently works with producers in the Underworld Music Group, an artist and producer group created by Clayco.

Lonely is affiliated with BigSmokeChapo’s Addicted To Money. He was later signed to Playboi Carti’s Opium label in early 2021, along with Ken Carson and Homixide Gang.

193,193,the alchemist,1187139,37919360,"Alan Daniel Maman (born October 25, 1977), better known as The Alchemist, is a hip-hop producer and MC. The Alchemist has been an active producer since 1991. He hails from affluent Beverly Hills, California. After rising to prominence in the late 1990s as a close associate of Dilated Peoples, he went on to produce for many of hip-hop's leading artists in the 2000s.

As a teen, Al began to identify strongly with the rebellious lyrics and urban sounds of hip-hop, and he began writing his own lyrics as a creative outlet. He joined up with other like-minded artists who wrote lyrics and rebelled strongly against their ""uptight"" suburban surroundings, among whom were Shifty Shellshock of Crazy Town, Evidence of Dilated Peoples and Scott Caan, son of James Caan. They would often hang out in urban areas of Los Angeles and participated in typical teenage rebellious activities like partying, smoking marijuana, and general mischief.

Al and Scott decided to become a duo named The Whooliganz. While rhyming at a party in L.A., they attracted the attention of B-Real of Cypress Hill. He invited the teens to join his crew, The Soul Assassins, which also included the groups House of Pain and Funkdoobiest. In 1993, the Whooliganz released their first single, ""Put Your Handz Up."" The song received little radio airplay and their record label, Tommy Boy Records, decided to shelve their album. Rejected, Scott focused his creative energy on acting while Al became interested in process of making hip-hop beats.

DJ Muggs took Al under his wing and taught him how to use a sampler and mixing board. After helping to produce a few tracks for Cypress Hill, Al became the main producer for his childhood friend, Evidence and his group Dilated Peoples. When Dilated debuted in 1998, they were an underground sensation creating a huge buzz about the man behind those incredible beats.

In 1999, Muggs introduced Al to his good friends, the popular hip-hop group Mobb Deep. Al produced two songs for their Murda Muzik album. Impressed by his production skills and street smarts, Mobb Deep took him under their wing, using his beats on all their subsequent albums. As Alchemist's profile increased, he went on to produce for many of hip hop's most successful and prominent artists, such as Nas, Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Ghostface Killah and Snoop Dogg. He has also remixed songs for bands and artists in other genres such as Linkin Park and Morcheeba. Al stayed loyal to his old friends, continuing to produce for Dilated, Cypress Hill, Everlast (formerly of House of Pain) and Crazy Town. He also enjoys producing for lesser-known underground rappers, often giving them some of his best beats. In 2004, 11 years after his rapping career folded, The Alchemist returned with his long-awaited debut album, ""1st Infantry.""

When he was sixteen he independently recorded and  three singles: ""Baila Conmigo"", ""Vámonos"" and ""Una Lady Como Tú"", the latter gained wide popularity in 2017, and shortly after he signed under the label La Industria Inc. ""Una Lady Como Tú"" became one of the most listened songs of 2017 in Spanish-speaking countries and made him gain a lot of popularity. As of July 2021, the music video for ""Una Lady Como Tú"" has recieved more than 1.4 billion views on YouTube and the song was streamed more than 495 million times on Spotify.

In October, 2017, he was featured in Piso 21 's song ""Déjala Que Vuelva"", which has gained more than 1.6 billion views on YouTube and more than 560 streams on Spotify. In December of the same year he released his second single ""Esperándote"", which accumulates more than 750 million views on YouTube. In 2018, he released various singles such as: ""Culpables"", ""Sola"", ""Una Vez Más"" with Noriel and ""Vaina Loca"" with Ozuna, the latter became his first Billboard Hot 100-charting hit, peaking at number 94 and staying on the chart for two weeks; while  his song ""Sola"" became his first number one song on the Billboard Latin Airplay chart in March 2019.  In August 2019, he released his first studio album ""ADN""  which featured songs with Zion & Lennox, Noriel, Ozuna, Darell, Nicky Jam, Sech, and Anuel AA. ADN peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot Latin Albums chart.

In spring 2020  he released his single ""Quiéreme Mientras Se Pueda"" - Love Me While As You Can, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Later that year he released ""La Nota"" with Rauw Alejandro and Myke Towers, and in April 2021 he released his sophomore album ""Dopamina"".

From a very young age, Manuel and his brother, Julián, were surrounded by music, playing any instrument that was passed through in the search of perfecting art. Thus, while Julian chose the guitar, Manuel focused on singing and began taking vocal technique classes in Montería with a Cuban teacher. For him, compositions with universal lyrics that seek to reach the soul, are the formula of success and longs for its fans to continue with the support they have shown so far.

Manuel Turizo will grow under the spotlight, between concerts and fans, but he is confident that the humility and goal he has set to be one of the greatest urban artists in Latin America, will make him stay on a fixed course.

33,33,sebastian yatra,529987,11546036,"Sebastián Obando Giraldo (born 15 October 1994), known professionally as Sebastián Yatra, is a Colombian singer and songwriter. He began as a Latin pop artist and has recorded many ballads, but has released several successful reggaeton singles. Yatra is noted for his romantic lyrics, melding traditional lyricism with modern reggaeton influences. He rose to prominence in Latin America in 2016 when he released the hit ""Traicionera"". He has released three studio albums and recorded with artists from a diverse range of musical genres throughout his career.

Born in Medellín and raised primarily in Miami, Yatra began singing at a young age and returned to Colombia to begin his musical career. He achieved breakout success with ""Traicionera"" followed by ""Robarte un Beso"" featuring Carlos Vives. ""Traicionera"" served as the lead single for his 2018 debut album, Mantra, which also featured the single ""Sutra"", featuring Puerto Rican rapper Dalmata. He then released the album Fantasia including the lead single ""Un Año"" featuring Mexican band Reik. He received continued success collaborating with Daddy Yankee, Natti Natasha, and the Jonas Brothers on the bilingual single ""Runaway"".

Yatra's music has been classified as Latin pop, reggaeton, and ballads. According to The Fader, Yatras music lands ""somewhere in between the olden times’ sappy romantics and the new wave’s sensuous vibras.""He is influenced by Latin pop and reggaeton artists Ricky Martin, J Balvin, Juanes, and Reik. In an interview with Billboard, he expressed a desire to collaborate with Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli. Yatra believes that contemporary musicians commit an ""error in associating ballads with boring and slow and old"", and hopes to rejuvenate intererest in ballads for a younger audience.However, his music contains elements of other genres; Desire Thompson of Vibe described his song ""Traicionera"" as a ""trap-EDM blend"".

Despite growing up in Florida and being fluent in English, Yatra sings almost exclusively in Spanish. Yatra explains, “My goal was always to be a singer in Spanish. And I really wanted to understand where I come from and live it. A lot of times I went to Colombia and, even though I spoke Spanish and was always speaking Spanish with my parents, I still felt like an outsider. I wasn’t 100 percent part of it. I wanted to give my roots the importance they deserve. ”His June 2019 song ""Runaway"" was his first foray into bilingual songwriting. In December 2019, he collaborated with South Korean boy group Monsta X for the song ""Magnetic"", which features verses from Yatra in Spanish and a bridge from Monsta X in Spanglish. Sara Delgado of Teen Vogue called the song a ""truly international pop hit"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sebastian+Yatra"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

37,37,farruko,663919,8379176,"Farruko is a reggaeton and Latin pop singer from Puerto Rico. His given name is Carlos Efren Reyes, and he was born in Bayamon, Puerto Rico in 1991. At the age of 16, he began to post his songs under his stage name to MySpace. His first single, ""Sexo Fuera del Planeta,"" gained thousands of followers, and from there he explored the potential of other social media networks. Due to his massive success on the Internet, he came to the attention of Puerto Rican radio and music industry executives, who enlisted his vocal talents for other artists.

Farruko's debut album, El Talento del Bloque, appeared when he was 18. It was released by Siente Music and distributed by Universal. Most of its 13 songs were self-penned. The set became an almost instant hit, and several singles followed from it. Some of the album's highlights included its collaborative tunes such as ""Su Hija Me Gusta"" with José Feliciano, ""Ella No Es Facil"" with Cosculluela, and ""Traime a Tu Amiga"" with Arcangel and Julio Voltio. He also issued the non-album smash ""Pa Romper la Discoteca"" with Daddy Yankee and Yomo. In 2012, he issued his sophomore offering, TMPR: The Most Powerful Rookie. Its first smash single was ""Feel the Rhythm"" (""Siente el Ritmo""), though it was one of five. As a whole, the set demonstrated that Farruko was as comfortable in electro and pop circles as he was in reggaeton; it was nominated for a Latin Grammy.

After touring throughout Latin America and the United States and establishing large fan bases in locales such as Venezuela and Colombia, he returned to recording in 2014. Farruko Presenta los Menores was released in late October of that year. A week after its release, it topped the Latin Albums chart. Among the notable collaborations are ""Salgo"" with Arcangel, Ñengo Flow, D. Ozi, and Genio y Kelmitt; ""Bebe Conmigo"" with J. Balvin; and ""Interesada"" with Luigi 21+. He won the Premios Juventud for the song ""6 AM"" with J. Balvin and Latin Grammy Awards for Best Urban Performance and Best Urban Song in 2015. In February of that year, he released ""Lejos de Aquí,"" a remix with Yandel. In June, he was Alejandra Guzman's surprise duet partner on her first urban single, ""Adios."" In July, he issued the pre-release track ""Sunset"" (featuring Shaggy and Nicky Jam), which garnered the top spot on various Latin airplay charts. In August, Farruko issued The Ones, a compilation of his charting singles and collaborations; it was a teaser for his next studio effort, Visionary, which appeared in late October. Pre-order excitement for the album propelled it to debut at number one on several Latin album charts; it remained there for several weeks after release. In 2017, he returned with his sixth studio album, Trapficante. As its title suggested, the artist put his money on the fusion of reggaeton and pop urban with the second generation of Latin trap, the latter he considered still in its infancy, making some commercial inroads but still far from its future force as the face of commercial mainstream Latin X pop -- despite its outlaw ties. He openly desired being the face of that future and drew on a host of new generation Latin trap artists as collaborators including Frank Miami, Sharo Torres, Rome, Mambo Kingz, DJ Luian, Maffio, Lil Geniuz, Bad Bunny, and Ladkani. The album was issued in September as Farruko undertook the U.S. leg of his global TrapXFicante tour. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Farruko"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

38,38,abraham mateo,133319,1961115,"Abraham Mateo (born in San Fernando (Cadiz), Spain on August 25, 1998) is a Spanish teen actor and pop singer. Abraham was discovered in 2009, when he was ten, by producers of the record label EMI Music Spain, who happened across Abraham's videos in Youtube and his multiple performances in the television show Menuda Noche on the Canal Sur TV of Andalucia, Spain. His self-titled debut album, Abraham Mateo, was released in Spain in December 2009. The album was produced by the spanish composer and producer Jacobo Calderon, who has worked before with internationally recognized latin singers such as Raphael, David Bisbal, and Luis Fonsi.

Beginnings

In 2006, when he was seven, he sang for the first time in public at the regional music competition for children ""Veo Veo"" organized by the Teresa Rabal Foundation in Andalucia, being awarded with a special mention of the jury. Two years later, he won the revelation award at the national music contest held in Murcia being selected to represent Spain at the ""Veo veo"" international competition. 

In 2005, Abraham auditioned for the television show ""Menuda Noche"" on the Canal Sur TV of Andalucia but was not cast for the show. Two years later he attended ""Menuda Noche"" to support his older brother Tony Mateo, who has been chosen to sing in the show, but Abraham was surprised by the show's presenter Juan y Medio and sang in place of his brother. Since then, Abraham has been a frequent guest of ""Menuda Noche"" singing in front of internationally recognized latin singers such as Raphael, David Bisbal, David Bustamante, and Juan Luis Guerra, who have praised Abraham for his strong vocal abilities and stage presence. Raphael said about him: ""That's singing without imitating anyone! You are a great singer!"", David Bustamante: ""You sing like the angels! Impressive! I think he is unique!"", and David Bisbal: ""I have no words! He has a wonderful technique, a very nice voice and a nice tessitura! I predict a huge success!"".

First album

Since his first appearances in ""Menuda Noche"", a friend of Abraham's family posted in Youtube videos of his performances, which soon enjoyed great popularity and caught the attention of producers of EMI Music Spain.

The album includes a duet with the french teen singer Caroline Costa, the runner-up in the 2008 edition of the television contest Incroyable Talent, the french version of America's Got Talent.

To promote the album, Abraham has toured through several cities in Spain and performed in many spanish radio and television shows, including the popular television programs Mas que baile, Tu si que vales, the show of Maria Teresa Campos, and the Christmas Eve Special of the Telecinco channel. He was also invited to perform at the International Carnival Maspalomas in Gran Canaria.

Cazzu es una artista de música urbana que se caracteriza por haber sido siempre muy voluble. Ha trabajado muchos estilos durante toda su carrera, pero encontró en el trap y el reguetón su verdadero lenguaje. El trap es por definición un compendio de géneros aglutinados, y Cazzu conoce perfectamente todos y cada uno de ellos.


La trapera estudió cine, y su conocimiento de la estética visual le ha ayudado mucho a la hora de conformar la suya propia. Su estilo es desinhibición en estado puro. Cargada de energía, para dar caña con cada tema.

Cazzu, con temas suaves que invitan a bailar y a moverse, es conocedora de todos esos géneros tan interesantes que conforman el trap argentino. Por ello, la trapera es sin duda una de las reinas del trap latino e internacional.

Se presentó en el panorama con su primer tema Killa. Una canción que sienta unas bases muy claras, una carta de presentación como mujer empoderada, llena de espíritu underground. La artista se ha ganado el respeto de todos los artistas de trap del panorama latino, llegando a colaborar con muchos de ellos.

Sus colaboracion con Bad Bunny, Duki y Khea en LOCA y LOCA REMIX es un himno del trap mundial.

El colegio, las calles y los vecinos del sector pueden dar fe de cómo fue el comienzo de su historia.

Luego de salir del colegio, a los 16 años, se proyectó para hacer música a nivel profesional. Inspirado por las música y las películas que vio de 50 Cent, Eminem o Daddy Yankee, Ryan salió a buscar su primer público: los usuarios del transporte urbano.

“Empecé a cantar en los buses a los 17 años porque empecé a sentir la necesidad de hacer algo y ayudar a la familia. La experiencia fue muy bacana y enriquecedora porque me hizo ganar mucha confianza”, cuenta el paisa.

En los buses hacía covers de Kafu Banton, de Baroni One Time y una que otra composición original. Su segunda gran plataforma fueron las discotecas del Valle de Aburrá, donde también cantó sus propias canciones como Morena, que es un rap romántico, y Mi Styling, un dancehall.

Luego de tocar varias puertas y ver limitadas sus oportunidades tomó la decisión de irse del país para trabajar, ahorrar dinero e invertirlo en su proyecto. Llegó a Curazao y trabajó en hoteles y restaurantes. Cada peso que ganó lo usó para costear sus producciones y los videos musicales.

En Curazao grabó dos canciones y gracias al bendito internet logró que se sonaran en su natal Medallo. Muchos creyeron que Ryan era extranjero.

Esas canciones vincularon a Ryan con la compañía discográfica del caleño Kevin Roldán. Para 2021, su nombre estará dos veces en el nuevo álbum de Kevin Roldán y, además, lanzará su disco debut que lleva por nombre El Cantante Del Guetto, un homenaje a sus raíces y su barrio. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Castro"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

At 23 years of age, he has broken ground in Central and South America, Mexico, the United States and Europe. Armed with his lyrical abilities and explosive personality, he is looking to make a name for himself in the ever so popular and growing urban/Latino market, leaving behind his former group of ""La Factoria"". 

His real name is Edgardo Antonio Miranda Beiro, and he was born in Panama City, Panama; on May 3rd, 1982. His passion for music began at the age of 12 with his main musical influence deriving from reggae, dance hall, and ""Reggaeton"", while listening to the pioneers of this genre like Chicho-Man, Nando-Boon, Renato Gaby, and last but not least, El General. 

Upon entering college, he studied Neurological Rehabilitation and Physical Therapy; however, his passion for the music drove him to audition for a local musical production under the direction of the local radio station called FACTORIA .1, under the supervision of Producer ""D.J. Pablito"", giving Joey Montana his first opportunity to record professionally and a major production of various artists. At that point, he began alternating between studying and pursuing a better musical career, and excelled at both. 

Not only was this young artist able to gain a fanbase in his home country, but also in countries like Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico, and England. In the year 2000, DJ Pablito, associated with another producer decided to form a group utilizing the former name of an older production called ""La Factoria"", which consisted of 3 Panamanian artists, one being Joey Montana (formerly known as MC JOE), and his companions, Dempra and Joycee. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Joey+Montana"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

El mayor tiene solo 26 años y el menor 21. Son jóvenes, sí, pero ya son conscientes de su éxito y más que un grupo, ellos se consideran una familia, pues lo más importante, antes de cantar, es la unión y la lealtad a su amistad.

Todo comenzó en junio del año 2007 cuando se conocieron en un asado que organizó un amigo que tenían en común. Conversando se dieron cuenta de que los cuatro eran músicos y terminaron cantando hasta las 6 de la mañana.

Días después El Profe buscó a Dim y al Llanero y les propuso formar un grupo, pero Dim dijo que sí con la condición de que también incluyeran a Pablito, quien estaba de viaje en ese momento en Contadora, Panamá.

Fue tanta la emoción y la ansiedad por crear el grupo que inmediatamente llamaron a Pablito a Panamá y el aceptó sin dudarlo.

Paso a paso
Su segundo encuentro, o mejor dicho su primer ensayo, fue en el club house de un amigo del edificio San Mitchel, en el piso 21, desde donde se podía ver la ciudad d medellin completa. Este se convirtió durante varios meses en su ensayadero oficial y era allí donde pasaban noches enteras montando las canciones.

""Durante esas noches soñábamos con que algún día escucharían nuestras composiciones en todas esas casa que veíamos desde allá"", cuenta Dim.

""Y creo que lo estamos logrando, pero ahora la idea es que también nos escuchen en aquellas de las que solo veíamos la luz, arriba en las montañas"", continúa El Profe.

Su nombre
A la hora de pensar en cómo se llamarían, dieron muchas vueltas y hasta lo consultaron con sus familias y sus profesores.

Al principio le buscaron por el lado de sus iniciales o pensaron en jugar un poco con los nombres de David y Pablo, pero luego de intentarlo por muchos lados, se les ocurrió Piso 21, pues fue a esta altura donde realmente conformaron el grupo.

Pero a este nombre también le han encontrado una metáfora, pues según ellos, indica que para arriba es adonde quieren llegar, dando pasos lentos, pero seguros y muy largos.

Precisamente antes de empezar cada concierto, el grupo se reúne para gritar su frase favorita ""Piso 21, vamos pa'arriba papá"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Piso+21"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

69,69,natti natasha,305801,4348769,"Natalia Alexandra Gutiérrez, known by her stage name Natti Natasha, is a Dominican reggaeton singer, songwriter, and actress. Hailing from Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Natasha grew up surrounded by endless musical influences and enrolled in Santiago’s School of Fine Arts at the age of seven where she developed her singing abilities, describing her time at the school as “one of the best of her life.” Her studio experience would begin as a teenager when she would record songs as a hobby and later alongside friends.

This all led up to her decision to make the biggest and riskiest move of her life, and that was to move to the United States. She settled in the Bronx, New York, or “the City of the Dreams and Dreamers” for young, aspiring musicians like her at the time. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Natti called the move “one of the craziest moves anyone ever did in her family,” and that she often looks back at the decision and wonders what she was doing. Natti would hop from studio to studio, working without pay, but to her, this was a way to get her name out there. A producer friend from Santiago would soon step in and lend her his New York studio.

Natti’s first-ever break came when icon Don Omar signed her to his record label, the Orfanato Music Group, and the pair would go on to make history for years to come. Their collaborations “Dutty Love,” “Tus Movimientos,” “Perdido en tus Ojos,” and a “Hold Ya” remix with Gyptian made waves across Latin America and introduced the world to future reggaeton royalty. Her debut project, an EP titled “All About Me” was released on March 28, 2012.

Natti would continue to make big career moves throughout the years including her departure from Don Omar’s record label and signing onto Pina Records in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2017 when her big breakout would come once and for all. Not only did she record and release a collaboration titled “Otra Cosa” alongside the legendary Daddy Yankee, but she also released what was arguably the biggest song of 2017. “Criminal” featuring Ozuna became an instant hit upon its release, the music video amassing over 1 billion views in just five months and becoming the most watched music video by a female singer released that year.

2019 saw the release of her much-anticipated debut album, “ilumiNATTI,” on February 15. 15 tracks made up the project with two collaborations in total, “Te Lo Dije'' with Anitta and “Soy Mía” with Kany García. Standout track “La Mejor Version de Mi” would transform into a bachata hit with its remix featuring bachata king Romeo Santos.

Natti’s sophomore album titled “NATTIVIDAD” would be released two years later on September 24, 2021 with 17 tracks featuring several chart-topping collaborators such as Becky G, Maluma, and Prince Royce. The release was followed up by the six-episode docuseries titled “Everybody Loves Natti” which documented her pregnancy and relationship with fiancé Raphy Pina. The series premiered on November 19, 2021 on Amazon Prime Video and was generally well received. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Natti+Natasha"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

70,70,pinto picasso,4725,98597,
71,71,valentino,72614,464052,"There are multiple musicians/bands under the same name.

1.) Valentino -- Pop-rock group from Sarajevo ""Valentino"" was founded in 1982. Group founder was the lead guitarist and songwriter Zijo Rizvanbegović - Valentino.  Zijo posted an advertisement in ""Oslobođenje"" (Sarajevo daily newspaper) looking for a lead singer and found Suad Jakirlić - Jaka. 

Valentino was a favorite of Goran Bregović, so they toured together with Bijelo Dugme. 
Goran Bregović played guitar on Valentino 1st album for a song ""Pazi na Ritam"". The Hit Song from that album was the song ""Volim te još"" (I still love you). 

Second album was titled ""Valentino II"" and released in 1985.  There were new additions to the group  Nikša Bratoš (on keyboards) and Ademir Volić - Kufi (drummer). They previously played in a band ""Bonton Baja"" which dissolved because of some government investigation concerning taxes. This caused their LP record to be pulled off the shelves minutes after being released, but a few people were lucky enough to purchase a handful. They are considered a collector's item and are very rare. 

The original line up of Valentino group consisted of: Zijo Rizvanbegović (guitar), Nikša Bratoš (keyboards), Suad Jakirlić (lead vocal), Emir Ćolaković (bass) i Ademir Volić (drums). 

Third album came out two years later (1987).  The Hit song was ""Oka tvoja dva"" (Your two eyes). 

Suad Jakirlić joined the army and after returning did not rejoin the group, or continue with his music career. In 1988 Nikša Bratoš moves to a new band [artist:Crvena Jabuka]. Dražen Ričl and Aljoša Buha, the main members of Crvena Jabuka died in 1987. 

New Valentino lead singer - Gogo Prušina helps make the fourth album. Zoran Šerbedžija joined the group as well as a new guitar player in 1988. 

Fifth album - ""Ponekad noću kad grad spava"" (Sometimes when she sleeps at night) (1989). Željko Brodarić - Jappa was the producer, Samir Šestan was on the keyboards, and a guitar player Zoran Petrović. 

As the War on the Balkans began in 1992, ""Valentino"", like many other groups, stopped working and making new music. After the War Zijo ""Valentino"" gathered the group together and got to working on another ablum titled “Moja kuća putujuća” (My Traveling House) with guests such as Hari Varešanović (Hari Mata Hari), Saša Lošić (Plavi Orkestar) and Alen Islamović. 

Six years after that album comes “Sve su se moje cure udale” (All of my girls have gotten married), which ended up sounding nothing like pop-rock sounds of Valentino but rather like ""narodna"" or country folk music. 

In 2006 there was ""Valentino 7"" under the production of City Records.



2.) Valentino is an Italo Disco project produced by Mauro Farina, Giuliano Crivellente, Franco Diaferia and Fabrizio Rizzolo, who also put his voice in the songs. Their hits are “Tonight”, “Tender Love”, “For Your Love” and “You Are The Sunshine”.


3.) Valentino is an eurodance act that released the single “Brand New Place”.


4.) Valentino Kanzyani is one of Slovenia's biggest music exports. As well as spinning techno and house on three decks across the world to huge crowds and acclaim he has released a barrage of dancefloor anthems for labels such as Primevil, Yoshi Toshi, Intec, Wet Musik, Tronic, Primate, Consumer Recreation and his and Umeks jointly run Recycled Loops and Earresistible imprints. If anyone can lay claim to putting Slovenia on the techno map then the name Valentino Kanzyani ranks high as one of its biggest propagators.

Already a big name DJ within his native Slovenia, in 1995 a club called Ambasada Gavioli opened and Valentino Kanzyani became known as the man behind one of Slovenias most famous venues. During a three and a half year period he booked and played with literally every DJ from around the globe but as the new millennium approached he left to oncentrate on his own DJing and production work. It was after going into the studio with his old friend, Umek that Valentino was to release his first record as Recycled Loops on Primevil in the summer of 1999. Thus, Valentino Kanzyanis name was soon to be heard in DJ sets all over the world and similarly his DJ gigs went supernova as he joined the jet set elite of globe-trotting record spinners.

Following the success of their initial release Umek and Valentino set up Recycled Loops as a label and have never looked back. Now having released some 12 records the duo also co-run Earresistible for their more house inspired production work whilst Valentino Kanzyanis single-handed production skills have graced labels as varied as Intec with the House Soul EP and Tronic (Burros Eslovenos) to Yoshi Toshi with the massive Flying whilst he has most recently remixed Carl Coxs new single, gaining Essential Selection status from Pete Tong.

Earresistible evolved due to the pairs shared passion for tribal house and elements of this and Valentinos techno side can be witnessed on the expertly mixed CDs Rock The Discotheque Volumes 1 and 2 (Matrix Musik) and the 40 odd remixes he has carried out on labels such as 23rd Century, Premier Sounds, 20:20, Urbana, Shine, ZYX, Intec, Wet Musik and the list goes on
Valentinos DJing has taken him to every corner of the world. His three deck skills are second to none.

Su padre lo inclinó por la música aunque el escogió el género urbano. Su primer sencillo contó con el apoyo de su amigo Pipe Calderon y su productor Dj Cano quienes realizaron ""En Busca De Ella"".

Se dio a conocer tanto a nivel nacional como internacional con el éxito ""Te Pintaron Pajaritos"" junto a Yandar & Yostin, ​ superando las 100 millones de visitas en YouTube. ​ Teniendo éxito en países como Argentina, Chile, España contando con el apoyo de Juan Magan, Ecuador, Venezuela, Perú y por supuesto Colombia.

78,78,don omar,1404663,22869901,"William Omar Landrón (born February 10, 1978 in Puerto Rico), better known as Don Omar, is a reggaeton singer. He is one of the most well known reggaeton artists in Latin America. His cross over success in the U.S. has given him more exposure to English speaking Reggaeton fans, making him one of the more recognizable faces of Reggaeton along with Daddy Yankee and Tego Calderón. Don Omar's popularity is currently rising and he recently appeared on MTV. Omar is best known for his songs ""Dile"" and ""Dale Don Dale"" from his first album The Last Don and ""Reggaeton Latino"". His songs center around life and love; some examples of these would be ""La Recompenza"" (The Reward), ""Pobre Diabla"" (Poor Devil (fem.)) and ""Aunque te Fuiste"" (Even Though You Left).

His debut album, The Last Don, sold over 350,000 units in South America. Both ""The Last Don"" as the live edition of it have been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Worldwide, The Last Don: Live [CD & DVD] sold over one million copies, according to the official website. His debut single, ""Dale Don Dale"", sold over 100,000 copies in South America. He received the awards for ""Latin Pop Album of the Year"" and ""New Artist & Latin Rap/Hip-Hop Album of the Year"" by the Billboard Latin Music Awards in 2003. The Last Don: Live [CD & DVD] was also nominated for ""Urban Music Album"" at the 2005 Latin Grammy Awards

He started his career after facing many obstacles when Héctor Delgado (from the duo Héctor y Tito) gave him an opportunity to be a backup singer. After that, he sang in a live concert with Héctor and Tito in 2003, which was released later as a CD and DVD, which included the songs that became instant hits, Baila Morena and Amor de Colegio.

In 2005, Don Omar released the reggaeton album ""Da Hitman Presents Reggaeton Latino"", which broke the record for ""Highest First Week Sales for a Reggaeton Album"" by selling over 31,000 units in its first week, resulting a debut of #61 in The Billboard 200. Wisin y Yandel held that record until ""Reggaeton Latino"" was released.

The first single released from Reggaeton Latino, ""Dale Don Dale [Remix]"" , which features rapper Fabolous, debuted at #1 on the crossover chart.

He is currently signed to VI Music through Universal Music Latino.

In early 2006, the Governor of Puerto Rico, Aníbal Acevedo Vilá publicly mentioned interest in having Don Omar participate in a program against School Desertion. However, the Secretary of Education has rejected Don Omar sponsoring it due to his lyrics. The local press has also mentioned that Omar himself did not finish High School.

Currently has his own record label ""El Orfanato"" (The Orphanage) and had a magnificent performance in the 2011 Latin Music Billboard Awards where he received the Award for Latin Rythm Airplay. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Don+Omar"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

84,84,dj nelson,78850,518299,"Nelson Díaz Martinez (born on April 7, 1972 in San Juan, Puerto Rico), known artistically as DJ Nelson is a DJ/producer who played a significant role in the development and popularization of reggaeton.[1] He first made a name for himself as part of the Noise, a club-centered collective that was spawned in 1992. The Noise—composed of DJs, MCs, producers, and club coordinators—hosted a long-lasting series of club nights in San Juan that were vital to the development and popularization of reggaeton. DJ Nelson earned credit as one of the top Noise DJs, and he also served as a producer/arranger for the collective's music.

In 1997 he made his CD debut, Nel-Zone, which was split into respective reggae and rap mixes, and he also was credited on a couple other CD releases that year: Don Chezina's Bien Guillao de Gangster and Ivy Queen's En Mi Imperio (1997). From this point forward, DJ Nelson began focusing on his solo career, primarily as a producer, with notable credits including Ivy Queen's The Original Rude Girl (1998) and Wisin & Yandel's Los Reyes del Nuevo Milenio (2000). His mixtape-style productions continued as well, with Undertrack Collection (2000) and Music (2001), the latter of which marked the advent of his personal brand, Flow Music.
DJ Nelson signed to this label a trio of young, up-and-coming producers: Francisco Saldaña, Víctor Cabrera, Norgie Noriega, the former two of whom are better known as Luny Tunes, of course, while the latter goes by just Noriega. These three producers pooled their talents together for Mas Flow (2003), a mixtape album that was groundbreaking in terms of popularity and influence. Numerous volumes followed, except without Noriega, who went the solo route, debuting with Contra la Corriente (2004). DJ Nelson continued with his own career as well, releasing Flow la Discoteka (2004) and opening a club of the same name, at which he was the resident DJ. In addition, he is credited with having set up The Mix 107.7, a popular Puerto Rican radio station hosted by DJ Coyote, and he even took his brand into the clothing industry, forming Flow Wear. Released in 2007, Flow la Discoteka, Vol. 2 featured his biggest hit single to date, ""Pasarela"", performed by Dalmata. DJ Nelson, Gerardo Cruet and Arcangel, consider themselves as pioneers in the new ""urban movement"", a sub-genre of reggaeton and hip-hop, Electro-Flow. Electro-Flow as Arcangel baptized it, is a blend of Hip-hop, reggaeton, dance-hall, electronica, and other futuristic sounds. Electro-flow can be heard in the songs. ""Chica Virtual"", ""Pa Que la Pases Bien"", ""Te Estoy Buscando"". ""Sexy Movimiento"", ""Siguelo"", ""Dame un Poquito"" by Wisin y Yandel. ""Veo Veo"" by Yaga y Mackie Ranks. Also ""Let's Do It"" ""No te Veo"" all are considered Electro-flow. Some songs lean more towards dance Hip Hop while some lean more towards Reggaeton depending on the song. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Nelson"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

87,87,mau y ricky,164298,2206215,"For the past few years, Mauricio and Ricky Montaner had been busy writing songs for other artists like Thalía, Miguel Bosé, Diego Boneta, Yuridia, Leslie Grace, to name a few, until recently when they decided the songs they were composing would be for their EP titled Arte under the label of Sony Music.

The young duo, Mau y Ricky, sons of music icon Ricardo Montaner, have released the album's first single, ""Voy Que Quemo,"" a song they decided best represents the music that is coming out in the LP, expected to release in July. ""After writing so many songs, it just seemed natural to start recording an album,"" Ricky, 25, tells Billboard, speaking on behalf of the duo since Mau was on vocal rest. ""We have 10 songs and an 11th that is an instrumental track. 'Voy Que Quemo' seemed like the best song to release first, and we're feeling super excited and nervous.""

Mau y Ricky partnered with Latin Grammy winner Julio Reyes Copello to produce their album and credit him for allowing them to grow artistically and teach them about following their intuition. ""We've grown as producers and songwriters, thanks to him. We also learned that the intuition of an artist is so important and it's something that needs to be respected because your intuition will differentiate you from others. We learned to write for ourselves and put out songs that will represent who we are.""

And that's exactly what Mau y Ricky did. They followed their intuition after listening to their song ""Arte"" which was almost going to be pitched to Wisin, but Ricky says, ""It didn't feel right for another artist to sing this song."" Another man they have to thank for guiding them since they started composing at a very young age is their father, who has written hit singles like ""La Cima del Cielo,"" ""Déjame Llorar"" and ""Me Va a Extrañar.""

""We've written songs together, so working with him helps you grow a lot because he's a very hard critic. Every song I've written since I was 8 years old, I'd run it by him and he'd give me feedback. He actually just heard the final product of our album and he loved it, thank God. But the best thing is that he's a fan of ours and we're huge fans of him. Yeah, he's my dad, but I'm a huge Ricardo Montaner fan.""

Besides a new album, Mau y Ricky fans can expect to see them onstage soon as they go out on tour. ""We haven't toured in such a long time because we were busy writing for others then started working on this album, but the stage is our natural habitat and where we feel most comfortable."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mau+y+Ricky"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The duo broke up due to Tito's belief of disloyalty from Hector.
