In December of the same year he released his second single ""Esperándote"", which accumulates more than 750 million views on YouTube. In 2018, he released various singles such as: ""Culpables"", ""Sola"", ""Una Vez Más"" with Noriel and ""Vaina Loca"" with Ozuna, the latter became his first Billboard Hot 100-charting hit, peaking at number 94 and staying on the chart for two weeks; while  his song ""Sola"" became his first number one song on the Billboard Latin Airplay chart in March 2019.

From a very young age, Manuel and his brother, Julián, were surrounded by music, playing any instrument that was passed through in the search of perfecting art. Thus, while Julian chose the guitar, Manuel focused on singing and began taking vocal technique classes in Montería with a Cuban teacher. For him, compositions with universal lyrics that seek to reach the soul, are the formula of success and longs for its fans to continue with the support they have shown so far.

Manuel Turizo will grow under the spotlight, between concerts and fans, but he is confident that the humility and goal he has set to be one of the greatest urban artists in Latin America, will make him stay on a fixed course.

33,sebastian yatra,529987,11546036,"Sebastián Obando Giraldo (born 15 October 1994), known professionally as Sebastián Yatra, is a Colombian singer and songwriter. He began as a Latin pop artist and has recorded many ballads, but has released several successful reggaeton singles. Yatra is noted for his romantic lyrics, melding traditional lyricism with modern reggaeton influences. He rose to prominence in Latin America in 2016 when he released the hit ""Traicionera"". He has released three studio albums and recorded with artists from a diverse range of musical genres throughout his career.

Born in Medellín and raised primarily in Miami, Yatra began singing at a young age and returned to Colombia to begin his musical career. He achieved breakout success with ""Traicionera"" followed by ""Robarte un Beso"" featuring Carlos Vives. ""Traicionera"" served as the lead single for his 2018 debut album, Mantra, which also featured the single ""Sutra"", featuring Puerto Rican rapper Dalmata. He then released the album Fantasia including the lead single ""Un Año"" featuring Mexican band Reik. He received continued success collaborating with Daddy Yankee, Natti Natasha, and the Jonas Brothers on the bilingual single ""Runaway"".

Yatra's music has been classified as Latin pop, reggaeton, and ballads. According to The Fader, Yatras music lands ""somewhere in between the olden times’ sappy romantics and the new wave’s sensuous vibras.""He is influenced by Latin pop and reggaeton artists Ricky Martin, J Balvin, Juanes, and Reik. In an interview with Billboard, he expressed a desire to collaborate with Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli. Yatra believes that contemporary musicians commit an ""error in associating ballads with boring and slow and old"", and hopes to rejuvenate intererest in ballads for a younger audience.However, his music contains elements of other genres; Desire Thompson of Vibe described his song ""Traicionera"" as a ""trap-EDM blend"".

Despite growing up in Florida and being fluent in English, Yatra sings almost exclusively in Spanish. Yatra explains, “My goal was always to be a singer in Spanish. And I really wanted to understand where I come from and live it. A lot of times I went to Colombia and, even though I spoke Spanish and was always speaking Spanish with my parents, I still felt like an outsider. I wasn’t 100 percent part of it. I wanted to give my roots the importance they deserve. ”His June 2019 song ""Runaway"" was his first foray into bilingual songwriting. In December 2019, he collaborated with South Korean boy group Monsta X for the song ""Magnetic"", which features verses from Yatra in Spanish and a bridge from Monsta X in Spanglish. Sara Delgado of Teen Vogue called the song a ""truly international pop hit"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sebastian+Yatra"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

At the age of 16, he began to post his songs under his stage name to MySpace. His first single, ""Sexo Fuera del Planeta,"" gained thousands of followers, and from there he explored the potential of other social media networks. Due to his massive success on the Internet, he came to the attention of Puerto Rican radio and music industry executives, who enlisted his vocal talents for other artists.

Farruko's debut album, El Talento del Bloque, appeared when he was 18. It was released by Siente Music and distributed by Universal. Most of its 13 songs were self-penned. The set became an almost instant hit, and several singles followed from it. Some of the album's highlights included its collaborative tunes such as ""Su Hija Me Gusta"" with José Feliciano, ""Ella No Es Facil"" with Cosculluela, and ""Traime a Tu Amiga"" with Arcangel and Julio Voltio. He also issued the non-album smash ""Pa Romper la Discoteca"" with Daddy Yankee and Yomo. In 2012, he issued his sophomore offering, TMPR: The Most Powerful Rookie. Its first smash single was ""Feel the Rhythm"" (""Siente el Ritmo""), though it was one of five. As a whole, the set demonstrated that Farruko was as comfortable in electro and pop circles as he was in reggaeton; it was nominated for a Latin Grammy.

After touring throughout Latin America and the United States and establishing large fan bases in locales such as Venezuela and Colombia, he returned to recording in 2014. Farruko Presenta los Menores was released in late October of that year. A week after its release, it topped the Latin Albums chart. Among the notable collaborations are ""Salgo"" with Arcangel, Ñengo Flow, D. Ozi, and Genio y Kelmitt; ""Bebe Conmigo"" with J. Balvin; and ""Interesada"" with Luigi 21+. He won the Premios Juventud for the song ""6 AM"" with J. Balvin and Latin Grammy Awards for Best Urban Performance and Best Urban Song in 2015. In February of that year, he released ""Lejos de Aquí,"" a remix with Yandel. In June, he was Alejandra Guzman's surprise duet partner on her first urban single, ""Adios."" In July, he issued the pre-release track ""Sunset"" (featuring Shaggy and Nicky Jam), which garnered the top spot on various Latin airplay charts. In August, Farruko issued The Ones, a compilation of his charting singles and collaborations; it was a teaser for his next studio effort, Visionary, which appeared in late October. Pre-order excitement for the album propelled it to debut at number one on several Latin album charts; it remained there for several weeks after release. In 2017, he returned with his sixth studio album, Trapficante. As its title suggested, the artist put his money on the fusion of reggaeton and pop urban with the second generation of Latin trap, the latter he considered still in its infancy, making some commercial inroads but still far from its future force as the face of commercial mainstream Latin X pop -- despite its outlaw ties. He openly desired being the face of that future and drew on a host of new generation Latin trap artists as collaborators including Frank Miami, Sharo Torres, Rome, Mambo Kingz, DJ Luian, Maffio, Lil Geniuz, Bad Bunny, and Ladkani. The album was issued in September as Farruko undertook the U.S. leg of his global TrapXFicante tour. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Farruko"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

38,abraham mateo,133319,1961115,"Abraham Mateo (born in San Fernando (Cadiz), Spain on August 25, 1998) is a Spanish teen actor and pop singer. Abraham was discovered in 2009, when he was ten, by producers of the record label EMI Music Spain, who happened across Abraham's videos in Youtube and his multiple performances in the television show Menuda Noche on the Canal Sur TV of Andalucia, Spain. His self-titled debut album, Abraham Mateo, was released in Spain in December 2009. The album was produced by the spanish composer and producer Jacobo Calderon, who has worked before with internationally recognized latin singers such as Raphael, David Bisbal, and Luis Fonsi.

Beginnings

In 2006, when he was seven, he sang for the first time in public at the regional music competition for children ""Veo Veo"" organized by the Teresa Rabal Foundation in Andalucia, being awarded with a special mention of the jury. Two years later, he won the revelation award at the national music contest held in Murcia being selected to represent Spain at the ""Veo veo"" international competition. 

In 2005, Abraham auditioned for the television show ""Menuda Noche"" on the Canal Sur TV of Andalucia but was not cast for the show. Two years later he attended ""Menuda Noche"" to support his older brother Tony Mateo, who has been chosen to sing in the show, but Abraham was surprised by the show's presenter Juan y Medio and sang in place of his brother. Since then, Abraham has been a frequent guest of ""Menuda Noche"" singing in front of internationally recognized latin singers such as Raphael, David Bisbal, David Bustamante, and Juan Luis Guerra, who have praised Abraham for his strong vocal abilities and stage presence. Raphael said about him: ""That's singing without imitating anyone! You are a great singer!"", David Bustamante: ""You sing like the angels! Impressive! I think he is unique!"", and David Bisbal: ""I have no words! He has a wonderful technique, a very nice voice and a nice tessitura! I predict a huge success!"".

First album

Since his first appearances in ""Menuda Noche"", a friend of Abraham's family posted in Youtube videos of his performances, which soon enjoyed great popularity and caught the attention of producers of EMI Music Spain. Early 2009, when he was ten, he signed a contract with EMI Music Spain and released in December of the same year his debut album, recorded in Madrid, under the title Abraham Mateo.

The album produced by Jacobo Calderon and Jose Luis de la Peña contains twelve songs, seven of them were composed by Calderon himself and four tracks are covers of popular latin songs such as Raphael's ""Cuando tu no estas"" (""When you are not here""), Alejandro Sanz's ""Los dos cogidos de la mano"" (""The two holding hands""), Laura Pausini's ""La soledad"" (""La solitudine/The loneliness"") and Luis Fonsi's ""Imaginame sin ti"" (""Imagine me without you""). The album includes a duet with the french teen singer Caroline Costa, the runner-up in the 2008 edition of the television contest Incroyable Talent, the french version of America's Got Talent. Abraham and Caroline recorded for the album a spanish version of Badfinger's ""Without you"", the song has also been covered with great success by Mariah Carey. To promote the album, Abraham has toured through several cities in Spain and performed in many spanish radio and television shows, including the popular television programs Mas que baile, Tu si que vales, the show of Maria Teresa Campos, and the Christmas Eve Special of the Telecinco channel. He was also invited to perform at the International Carnival Maspalomas in Gran Canaria.

In summer 2010, he recorded his first song in english, a cover version of the Celine Dion hit I surrender.

Acting

Abraham acted in the TV movies ""Días sin Luz"" (2009) and ""Raphael: una historia de superacion personal"" (2010) both produced by Antena 3 Films and broadcasted by the spanish television channel Antena 3. In the biopic ""Raphael: una historia de superacion personal"", he portrayed the worldwide acclamed spanish singer Raphael in the early years of his career and sang some of the vocal tracks.

48,cazzu,151055,3534249,"Julieta Cazzucheli nació en 1994 en Jujuy (Argentina), rodeada siempre de un ambiente bastante folklórico. Fue en ese ambiente dónde comenzó a tener sus primeros contactos con la música. Estuvo en varios grupos de cumbia y lleva haciendo música desde hace catorce años.

Cazzu es una artista de música urbana que se caracteriza por haber sido siempre muy voluble. Ha trabajado muchos estilos durante toda su carrera, pero encontró en el trap y el reguetón su verdadero lenguaje. El trap es por definición un compendio de géneros aglutinados, y Cazzu conoce perfectamente todos y cada uno de ellos.


La trapera estudió cine, y su conocimiento de la estética visual le ha ayudado mucho a la hora de conformar la suya propia. Su estilo es desinhibición en estado puro. Cargada de energía, para dar caña con cada tema.

Cazzu, con temas suaves que invitan a bailar y a moverse, es conocedora de todos esos géneros tan interesantes que conforman el trap argentino. Por ello, la trapera es sin duda una de las reinas del trap latino e internacional.

Se presentó en el panorama con su primer tema Killa. Una canción que sienta unas bases muy claras, una carta de presentación como mujer empoderada, llena de espíritu underground. La artista se ha ganado el respeto de todos los artistas de trap del panorama latino, llegando a colaborar con muchos de ellos.

Sus colaboracion con Bad Bunny, Duki y Khea en LOCA y LOCA REMIX es un himno del trap mundial.

Sin duda, Cazzu, es una artista de pies a cabeza. Su presencia es poderosa y llena de arte propia. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cazzu"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

50,ryan castro,281921,5187415,"Ryan Castro es una de las nuevas caras del reggaetón y, aunque en sus videos juega con la clásica estética aspiracional de los carros de alta gama y las mansiones, su proyecto nació en el barrio Pedregal, al norte de Medellín. El colegio, las calles y los vecinos del sector pueden dar fe de cómo fue el comienzo de su historia.

Luego de salir del colegio, a los 16 años, se proyectó para hacer música a nivel profesional. Inspirado por las música y las películas que vio de 50 Cent, Eminem o Daddy Yankee, Ryan salió a buscar su primer público: los usuarios del transporte urbano.

“Empecé a cantar en los buses a los 17 años porque empecé a sentir la necesidad de hacer algo y ayudar a la familia. La experiencia fue muy bacana y enriquecedora porque me hizo ganar mucha confianza”, cuenta el paisa.

En los buses hacía covers de Kafu Banton, de Baroni One Time y una que otra composición original. Su segunda gran plataforma fueron las discotecas del Valle de Aburrá, donde también cantó sus propias canciones como Morena, que es un rap romántico, y Mi Styling, un dancehall.

Luego de tocar varias puertas y ver limitadas sus oportunidades tomó la decisión de irse del país para trabajar, ahorrar dinero e invertirlo en su proyecto. Llegó a Curazao y trabajó en hoteles y restaurantes. Cada peso que ganó lo usó para costear sus producciones y los videos musicales.

En Curazao grabó dos canciones y gracias al bendito internet logró que se sonaran en su natal Medallo. Muchos creyeron que Ryan era extranjero.

Esas canciones vincularon a Ryan con la compañía discográfica del caleño Kevin Roldán. Para 2021, su nombre estará dos veces en el nuevo álbum de Kevin Roldán y, además, lanzará su disco debut que lleva por nombre El Cantante Del Guetto, un homenaje a sus raíces y su barrio. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Castro"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

At 23 years of age, he has broken ground in Central and South America, Mexico, the United States and Europe. Armed with his lyrical abilities and explosive personality, he is looking to make a name for himself in the ever so popular and growing urban/Latino market, leaving behind his former group of ""La Factoria"". 

His real name is Edgardo Antonio Miranda Beiro, and he was born in Panama City, Panama; on May 3rd, 1982. His passion for music began at the age of 12 with his main musical influence deriving from reggae, dance hall, and ""Reggaeton"", while listening to the pioneers of this genre like Chicho-Man, Nando-Boon, Renato Gaby, and last but not least, El General. 

Upon entering college, he studied Neurological Rehabilitation and Physical Therapy; however, his passion for the music drove him to audition for a local musical production under the direction of the local radio station called FACTORIA .1, under the supervision of Producer ""D.J. Pablito"", giving Joey Montana his first opportunity to record professionally and a major production of various artists. At that point, he began alternating between studying and pursuing a better musical career, and excelled at both. 

Not only was this young artist able to gain a fanbase in his home country, but also in countries like Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico, and England. In the year 2000, DJ Pablito, associated with another producer decided to form a group utilizing the former name of an older production called ""La Factoria"", which consisted of 3 Panamanian artists, one being Joey Montana (formerly known as MC JOE), and his companions, Dempra and Joycee. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Joey+Montana"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

El mayor tiene solo 26 años y el menor 21. Son jóvenes, sí, pero ya son conscientes de su éxito y más que un grupo, ellos se consideran una familia, pues lo más importante, antes de cantar, es la unión y la lealtad a su amistad.

Todo comenzó en junio del año 2007 cuando se conocieron en un asado que organizó un amigo que tenían en común. Conversando se dieron cuenta de que los cuatro eran músicos y terminaron cantando hasta las 6 de la mañana.

Días después El Profe buscó a Dim y al Llanero y les propuso formar un grupo, pero Dim dijo que sí con la condición de que también incluyeran a Pablito, quien estaba de viaje en ese momento en Contadora, Panamá.

Fue tanta la emoción y la ansiedad por crear el grupo que inmediatamente llamaron a Pablito a Panamá y el aceptó sin dudarlo.

Paso a paso
Su segundo encuentro, o mejor dicho su primer ensayo, fue en el club house de un amigo del edificio San Mitchel, en el piso 21, desde donde se podía ver la ciudad d medellin completa. Este se convirtió durante varios meses en su ensayadero oficial y era allí donde pasaban noches enteras montando las canciones.

""Durante esas noches soñábamos con que algún día escucharían nuestras composiciones en todas esas casa que veíamos desde allá"", cuenta Dim.

""Y creo que lo estamos logrando, pero ahora la idea es que también nos escuchen en aquellas de las que solo veíamos la luz, arriba en las montañas"", continúa El Profe.

Su nombre
A la hora de pensar en cómo se llamarían, dieron muchas vueltas y hasta lo consultaron con sus familias y sus profesores.

Al principio le buscaron por el lado de sus iniciales o pensaron en jugar un poco con los nombres de David y Pablo, pero luego de intentarlo por muchos lados, se les ocurrió Piso 21, pues fue a esta altura donde realmente conformaron el grupo.

Pero a este nombre también le han encontrado una metáfora, pues según ellos, indica que para arriba es adonde quieren llegar, dando pasos lentos, pero seguros y muy largos.

Precisamente antes de empezar cada concierto, el grupo se reúne para gritar su frase favorita ""Piso 21, vamos pa'arriba papá"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Piso+21"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

69,natti natasha,305801,4348769,"Natalia Alexandra Gutiérrez, known by her stage name Natti Natasha, is a Dominican reggaeton singer, songwriter, and actress. Hailing from Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Natasha grew up surrounded by endless musical influences and enrolled in Santiago’s School of Fine Arts at the age of seven where she developed her singing abilities, describing her time at the school as “one of the best of her life.” Her studio experience would begin as a teenager when she would record songs as a hobby and later alongside friends.

This all led up to her decision to make the biggest and riskiest move of her life, and that was to move to the United States. She settled in the Bronx, New York, or “the City of the Dreams and Dreamers” for young, aspiring musicians like her at the time. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Natti called the move “one of the craziest moves anyone ever did in her family,” and that she often looks back at the decision and wonders what she was doing. Natti would hop from studio to studio, working without pay, but to her, this was a way to get her name out there. A producer friend from Santiago would soon step in and lend her his New York studio.

Natti’s first-ever break came when icon Don Omar signed her to his record label, the Orfanato Music Group, and the pair would go on to make history for years to come. Their collaborations “Dutty Love,” “Tus Movimientos,” “Perdido en tus Ojos,” and a “Hold Ya” remix with Gyptian made waves across Latin America and introduced the world to future reggaeton royalty. Her debut project, an EP titled “All About Me” was released on March 28, 2012.

Natti would continue to make big career moves throughout the years including her departure from Don Omar’s record label and signing onto Pina Records in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2017 when her big breakout would come once and for all. Not only did she record and release a collaboration titled “Otra Cosa” alongside the legendary Daddy Yankee, but she also released what was arguably the biggest song of 2017. “Criminal” featuring Ozuna became an instant hit upon its release, the music video amassing over 1 billion views in just five months and becoming the most watched music video by a female singer released that year.

2019 saw the release of her much-anticipated debut album, “ilumiNATTI,” on February 15. 15 tracks made up the project with two collaborations in total, “Te Lo Dije'' with Anitta and “Soy Mía” with Kany García. Standout track “La Mejor Version de Mi” would transform into a bachata hit with its remix featuring bachata king Romeo Santos.

Natti’s sophomore album titled “NATTIVIDAD” would be released two years later on September 24, 2021 with 17 tracks featuring several chart-topping collaborators such as Becky G, Maluma, and Prince Royce. The release was followed up by the six-episode docuseries titled “Everybody Loves Natti” which documented her pregnancy and relationship with fiancé Raphy Pina. The series premiered on November 19, 2021 on Amazon Prime Video and was generally well received. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Natti+Natasha"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

70,pinto picasso,4725,98597,
71,valentino,72614,464052,"There are multiple musicians/bands under the same name.

1.) Valentino -- Pop-rock group from Sarajevo ""Valentino"" was founded in 1982. Group founder was the lead guitarist and songwriter Zijo Rizvanbegović - Valentino.  Zijo posted an advertisement in ""Oslobođenje"" (Sarajevo daily newspaper) looking for a lead singer and found Suad Jakirlić - Jaka. 

Valentino was a favorite of Goran Bregović, so they toured together with Bijelo Dugme. 
Goran Bregović played guitar on Valentino 1st album for a song ""Pazi na Ritam"". The Hit Song from that album was the song ""Volim te još"" (I still love you). 

Second album was titled ""Valentino II"" and released in 1985.  There were new additions to the group  Nikša Bratoš (on keyboards) and Ademir Volić - Kufi (drummer). They previously played in a band ""Bonton Baja"" which dissolved because of some government investigation concerning taxes. This caused their LP record to be pulled off the shelves minutes after being released, but a few people were lucky enough to purchase a handful. They are considered a collector's item and are very rare. 

The original line up of Valentino group consisted of: Zijo Rizvanbegović (guitar), Nikša Bratoš (keyboards), Suad Jakirlić (lead vocal), Emir Ćolaković (bass) i Ademir Volić (drums). 

Third album came out two years later (1987).  The Hit song was ""Oka tvoja dva"" (Your two eyes). 

Suad Jakirlić joined the army and after returning did not rejoin the group, or continue with his music career. In 1988 Nikša Bratoš moves to a new band [artist:Crvena Jabuka]. Dražen Ričl and Aljoša Buha, the main members of Crvena Jabuka died in 1987. 

New Valentino lead singer - Gogo Prušina helps make the fourth album. Zoran Šerbedžija joined the group as well as a new guitar player in 1988. 

Fifth album - ""Ponekad noću kad grad spava"" (Sometimes when she sleeps at night) (1989). Željko Brodarić - Jappa was the producer, Samir Šestan was on the keyboards, and a guitar player Zoran Petrović. 

As the War on the Balkans began in 1992, ""Valentino"", like many other groups, stopped working and making new music. After the War Zijo ""Valentino"" gathered the group together and got to working on another ablum titled “Moja kuća putujuća” (My Traveling House) with guests such as Hari Varešanović (Hari Mata Hari), Saša Lošić (Plavi Orkestar) and Alen Islamović. 

Six years after that album comes “Sve su se moje cure udale” (All of my girls have gotten married), which ended up sounding nothing like pop-rock sounds of Valentino but rather like ""narodna"" or country folk music. 

In 2006 there was ""Valentino 7"" under the production of City Records.



2.) Valentino is an Italo Disco project produced by Mauro Farina, Giuliano Crivellente, Franco Diaferia and Fabrizio Rizzolo, who also put his voice in the songs. Their hits are “Tonight”, “Tender Love”, “For Your Love” and “You Are The Sunshine”.


3.) Valentino is an eurodance act that released the single “Brand New Place”.


4.) Valentino Kanzyani is one of Slovenia's biggest music exports. As well as spinning techno and house on three decks across the world to huge crowds and acclaim he has released a barrage of dancefloor anthems for labels such as Primevil, Yoshi Toshi, Intec, Wet Musik, Tronic, Primate, Consumer Recreation and his and Umeks jointly run Recycled Loops and Earresistible imprints. If anyone can lay claim to putting Slovenia on the techno map then the name Valentino Kanzyani ranks high as one of its biggest propagators.

Already a big name DJ within his native Slovenia, in 1995 a club called Ambasada Gavioli opened and Valentino Kanzyani became known as the man behind one of Slovenias most famous venues. During a three and a half year period he booked and played with literally every DJ from around the globe but as the new millennium approached he left to oncentrate on his own DJing and production work. It was after going into the studio with his old friend, Umek that Valentino was to release his first record as Recycled Loops on Primevil in the summer of 1999. Thus, Valentino Kanzyanis name was soon to be heard in DJ sets all over the world and similarly his DJ gigs went supernova as he joined the jet set elite of globe-trotting record spinners.

Following the success of their initial release Umek and Valentino set up Recycled Loops as a label and have never looked back. Now having released some 12 records the duo also co-run Earresistible for their more house inspired production work whilst Valentino Kanzyanis single-handed production skills have graced labels as varied as Intec with the House Soul EP and Tronic (Burros Eslovenos) to Yoshi Toshi with the massive Flying whilst he has most recently remixed Carl Coxs new single, gaining Essential Selection status from Pete Tong.

Earresistible evolved due to the pairs shared passion for tribal house and elements of this and Valentinos techno side can be witnessed on the expertly mixed CDs Rock The Discotheque Volumes 1 and 2 (Matrix Musik) and the 40 odd remixes he has carried out on labels such as 23rd Century, Premier Sounds, 20:20, Urbana, Shine, ZYX, Intec, Wet Musik and the list goes on
Valentinos DJing has taken him to every corner of the world. His three deck skills are second to none.

78,don omar,1404663,22869901,"William Omar Landrón (born February 10, 1978 in Puerto Rico), better known as Don Omar, is a reggaeton singer. He is one of the most well known reggaeton artists in Latin America. His cross over success in the U.S. has given him more exposure to English speaking Reggaeton fans, making him one of the more recognizable faces of Reggaeton along with Daddy Yankee and Tego Calderón. Don Omar's popularity is currently rising and he recently appeared on MTV. Omar is best known for his songs ""Dile"" and ""Dale Don Dale"" from his first album The Last Don and ""Reggaeton Latino"". His songs center around life and love; some examples of these would be ""La Recompenza"" (The Reward), ""Pobre Diabla"" (Poor Devil (fem.)) and ""Aunque te Fuiste"" (Even Though You Left).

His debut album, The Last Don, sold over 350,000 units in South America. Both ""The Last Don"" as the live edition of it have been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Worldwide, The Last Don: Live [CD & DVD] sold over one million copies, according to the official website. His debut single, ""Dale Don Dale"", sold over 100,000 copies in South America. He received the awards for ""Latin Pop Album of the Year"" and ""New Artist & Latin Rap/Hip-Hop Album of the Year"" by the Billboard Latin Music Awards in 2003. The Last Don: Live [CD & DVD] was also nominated for ""Urban Music Album"" at the 2005 Latin Grammy Awards

He started his career after facing many obstacles when Héctor Delgado (from the duo Héctor y Tito) gave him an opportunity to be a backup singer. After that, he sang in a live concert with Héctor and Tito in 2003, which was released later as a CD and DVD, which included the songs that became instant hits, Baila Morena and Amor de Colegio.

In 2005, Don Omar released the reggaeton album ""Da Hitman Presents Reggaeton Latino"", which broke the record for ""Highest First Week Sales for a Reggaeton Album"" by selling over 31,000 units in its first week, resulting a debut of #61 in The Billboard 200. Wisin y Yandel held that record until ""Reggaeton Latino"" was released.

The first single released from Reggaeton Latino, ""Dale Don Dale [Remix]"" , which features rapper Fabolous, debuted at #1 on the crossover chart.

He is currently signed to VI Music through Universal Music Latino.

In early 2006, the Governor of Puerto Rico, Aníbal Acevedo Vilá publicly mentioned interest in having Don Omar participate in a program against School Desertion. However, the Secretary of Education has rejected Don Omar sponsoring it due to his lyrics. The local press has also mentioned that Omar himself did not finish High School.

Currently has his own record label ""El Orfanato"" (The Orphanage) and had a magnificent performance in the 2011 Latin Music Billboard Awards where he received the Award for Latin Rythm Airplay. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Don+Omar"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

84,dj nelson,78850,518299,"Nelson Díaz Martinez (born on April 7, 1972 in San Juan, Puerto Rico), known artistically as DJ Nelson is a DJ/producer who played a significant role in the development and popularization of reggaeton.[1] He first made a name for himself as part of the Noise, a club-centered collective that was spawned in 1992. The Noise—composed of DJs, MCs, producers, and club coordinators—hosted a long-lasting series of club nights in San Juan that were vital to the development and popularization of reggaeton. DJ Nelson earned credit as one of the top Noise DJs, and he also served as a producer/arranger for the collective's music.

In 1997 he made his CD debut, Nel-Zone, which was split into respective reggae and rap mixes, and he also was credited on a couple other CD releases that year: Don Chezina's Bien Guillao de Gangster and Ivy Queen's En Mi Imperio (1997). From this point forward, DJ Nelson began focusing on his solo career, primarily as a producer, with notable credits including Ivy Queen's The Original Rude Girl (1998) and Wisin & Yandel's Los Reyes del Nuevo Milenio (2000). His mixtape-style productions continued as well, with Undertrack Collection (2000) and Music (2001), the latter of which marked the advent of his personal brand, Flow Music.
DJ Nelson signed to this label a trio of young, up-and-coming producers: Francisco Saldaña, Víctor Cabrera, Norgie Noriega, the former two of whom are better known as Luny Tunes, of course, while the latter goes by just Noriega. These three producers pooled their talents together for Mas Flow (2003), a mixtape album that was groundbreaking in terms of popularity and influence. Numerous volumes followed, except without Noriega, who went the solo route, debuting with Contra la Corriente (2004). DJ Nelson continued with his own career as well, releasing Flow la Discoteka (2004) and opening a club of the same name, at which he was the resident DJ. In addition, he is credited with having set up The Mix 107.7, a popular Puerto Rican radio station hosted by DJ Coyote, and he even took his brand into the clothing industry, forming Flow Wear. Released in 2007, Flow la Discoteka, Vol. 2 featured his biggest hit single to date, ""Pasarela"", performed by Dalmata. DJ Nelson, Gerardo Cruet and Arcangel, consider themselves as pioneers in the new ""urban movement"", a sub-genre of reggaeton and hip-hop, Electro-Flow. Electro-Flow as Arcangel baptized it, is a blend of Hip-hop, reggaeton, dance-hall, electronica, and other futuristic sounds. Electro-flow can be heard in the songs. ""Chica Virtual"", ""Pa Que la Pases Bien"", ""Te Estoy Buscando"". ""Sexy Movimiento"", ""Siguelo"", ""Dame un Poquito"" by Wisin y Yandel. ""Veo Veo"" by Yaga y Mackie Ranks. Also ""Let's Do It"" ""No te Veo"" all are considered Electro-flow. Some songs lean more towards dance Hip Hop while some lean more towards Reggaeton depending on the song. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Nelson"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

87,mau y ricky,164298,2206215,"For the past few years, Mauricio and Ricky Montaner had been busy writing songs for other artists like Thalía, Miguel Bosé, Diego Boneta, Yuridia, Leslie Grace, to name a few, until recently when they decided the songs they were composing would be for their EP titled Arte under the label of Sony Music.

The young duo, Mau y Ricky, sons of music icon Ricardo Montaner, have released the album's first single, ""Voy Que Quemo,"" a song they decided best represents the music that is coming out in the LP, expected to release in July. ""After writing so many songs, it just seemed natural to start recording an album,"" Ricky, 25, tells Billboard, speaking on behalf of the duo since Mau was on vocal rest. ""We have 10 songs and an 11th that is an instrumental track. 'Voy Que Quemo' seemed like the best song to release first, and we're feeling super excited and nervous.""

Mau y Ricky partnered with Latin Grammy winner Julio Reyes Copello to produce their album and credit him for allowing them to grow artistically and teach them about following their intuition. ""We've grown as producers and songwriters, thanks to him. We also learned that the intuition of an artist is so important and it's something that needs to be respected because your intuition will differentiate you from others. We learned to write for ourselves and put out songs that will represent who we are.""

And that's exactly what Mau y Ricky did. They followed their intuition after listening to their song ""Arte"" which was almost going to be pitched to Wisin, but Ricky says, ""It didn't feel right for another artist to sing this song."" Another man they have to thank for guiding them since they started composing at a very young age is their father, who has written hit singles like ""La Cima del Cielo,"" ""Déjame Llorar"" and ""Me Va a Extrañar.""

""We've written songs together, so working with him helps you grow a lot because he's a very hard critic. Every song I've written since I was 8 years old, I'd run it by him and he'd give me feedback. He actually just heard the final product of our album and he loved it, thank God. But the best thing is that he's a fan of ours and we're huge fans of him. Yeah, he's my dad, but I'm a huge Ricardo Montaner fan.""

Besides a new album, Mau y Ricky fans can expect to see them onstage soon as they go out on tour. ""We haven't toured in such a long time because we were busy writing for others then started working on this album, but the stage is our natural habitat and where we feel most comfortable."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mau+y+Ricky"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

As Héctor & Tito

Tito and his partner released a number of hit songs in their native Puerto Rico, including ""Amor de Colegio"" (ft. Don Omar), ""Felina"", ""Baila Morena"" (ft.

After years of working together, they separated, but not before releasing a final album, Season Finale, which featured some of their greatest hits. The duo broke up due to Tito's belief of disloyalty from Hector.

Daddy Yankee), ""Tu Cintura"" (ft. Don Omar), ""Flow Natural"" (ft. Beenie Man and Deevani) ""Secreto"", ""Máximo"", ""Tuve Que Morir"" and ""Me Da Miedo"" among others.
