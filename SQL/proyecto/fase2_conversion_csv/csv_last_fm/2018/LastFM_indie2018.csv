1,izal,59554,2698099,"In 2010, with more than 10 years of experience behind them, five musicians came together to form IZAL. A band made up of Mikel Izal (vocals, composer, guitar, ukulele), Emanuel Pérez “Gato” (bass), Alejandro Jordá (drums and percussion), Alberto Pérez (guitar, Lap Steel) and Iván Mella (piano, keyboards, synthesizers ). Coming from different geographical locations, Madrid became their ""base"" of operations, which is why the name ""Madrid band"" has been highly honored since its inception, despite not being originally from the capital. Vitoria and Pamplona, Málaga and Henderson (Argentina), Valencia, Calamonte in Extremadura and Bilbao come together in a band with multiple references that have managed to create their own musical and conceptual personality.

Step by step, with 4 studio albums behind them (Magia y efectos especiales (2012), Agujeros de worm (2013), Copacabana (2015) and Autoterapia (2018), the band is positioned as the benchmark of the alternative scene and pop-rock from Spain, as the headliner at festivals as well as filling large arenas on their own tours, with the plus of having carried out a totally self-managed career from the beginning.

In autumn 2021, their fifth studio album, Hogar, was released independently, under the Hook Ediciones Musicales label and distributed by Altafonte. Hogar, an album of ten everyday stories told through photography, storytelling, video and song. Produced by IZAL, Brett Shaw (Foals, Florence and The Machine, Lady Gaga, etc.) and Sancho Gómez-Escolar, who dedicated the last months of 2020 to building ten new musical homes straddling the landscapes of the Tramontana mountains in Mallorca , the frenzy of the Madrid asphalt and the stubborn London rain. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Izal"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

5,ellie goulding,3346543,125561969,"Ellie Goulding (born Elena Jane Goulding, 30 December 1986 in Hereford, England) is an English singer-songwriter. Having caught the public's attention in 2010 with her singles ""Starry Eyed"" and ""Guns and Horses,"" British vocalist Ellie Goulding quickly rose to the top of the charts with her infectious electronic pop sound. Although she started out writing songs in a folk-inflected style, she eventually grew into a more electronic-influenced artist, touching upon dance music and ambient synth pop. With her unique soprano warble and knack for writing catchy yet emotionally earnest songs, Goulding, much like her predecessors Kate Bush and Imogen Heap, stands at the forefront of contemporary mainstream music and arty, independent-minded pop.

Born in Hereford, England, she later moved to the country's east coast to study drama at the University of Kent. Goulding had developed a love for folk music as a teenager, and her time at university also exposed her to electronica. After two years, she took a break from her studies and moved to West London, where she pursued a career as an alternative singer/songwriter and befriended producers like Starsmith and Frankmusik, who gave her songs an electro-pop twist. In 2009, Goulding began building an audience via the Internet, where early tracks like ""Starry Eyed"" and a cover of Sam Sparro's ""Black & Gold"" were posted on tastemaking MP3 blogs such as Discodust. Goulding soon graduated from the blogosphere to print media, gaining praise from mainstream publications like The Guardian and fielding offers from record labels. She ultimately signed a major-label deal with Polydor Records and began making preparations to release her debut album. In the meantime, she penned songs for Diana Vickers, Gabriella Climi, and others.

During the final weeks of 2009, Goulding topped the BBC's Sound of 2010, a poll conducted by British music critics and industry insiders to identify new talent. Building on that momentum, she released Lights -- a sparkling debut album that splashed Goulding's vocal flutter across a landscape of acoustic and synthesized instruments -- in March 2010. Lights topped the U.K. charts during its first week and spun off ""Starry Eyed"" as a Top Five single (it also charted well in Ireland and New Zealand). Later that year, the album was re-released as Bright Lights, featuring seven new recordings (including a cover of Elton John's ""Your Song,"" which peaked at number two).

In 2012, Goulding returned with her sophomore album, Halcyon, which showcased an even more sonically adventurous, electro-pop-infused sound. In 2013, a deluxe reissue featuring ten extra songs was released; entitled Halcyon Days, it acted as a supplement to the original release. Two of its new songs, ""Burn"" and ""How Long Will I Love You,"" were among her biggest hits. The following year, she was featured on Calvin Harris' Top Ten U.K. hit ""Outside,"" participated in Band Aid 30's update of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?,"" and entered the U.K. Top Ten once more with ""Beating Heart,"" a song released on the soundtrack for Divergent. Another soundtrack single, ""Love Me Like You Do,"" added to the success of Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015.

That same year, Goulding released her third studio album, Delirium, which featured collaborations with Max Martin, Greg Kurstin, and others. The pop-leaning Delirium included the single ""On My Mind"" and peaked at number three on the U.S. and U.K. charts. Goulding returned in 2017 on ""First Time,"" a collaboration with electronic producer Kygo.

In 2018, Goulding joined Tap Management after almost a decade with First Access Management.[107] She appeared on a collaboration with Sean Paul on his Mad Love the Prequel EP titled ""Bad Love"", released on 29 June 2018.[108]

Goulding collaborated with Diplo and Swae Lee on the single ""Close to Me"", which was released on 24 October 2018.[109] On 1 January 2019, The Guardian reported that she has been working on her fourth album, set to release in the same year.[110] On 1 March, she released the next single ""Flux"".[111] She said regarding the album, ""It's very much written by me"".[112]

On 12 April 2019, Goulding released the single ""Sixteen"".[113] Goulding said of the single, ""...That age was such a pivotal year for me in many ways and this song is so close to my heart. It takes me back to the reckless days of being a teenager and I hope it reminds us all about the innocence of youth.""[114]

Goulding released ""Hate Me"" with American rapper Juice Wrld on 26 June 2019.[115][116] It was premiered by Zane Lowe as his 'World Record' on Beats 1.[117] In July, Goulding stated that her next material to be released would be the songs ""Woman I Am"" and ""Start"".[118] In November, she released her rendition of Joni Mitchell's Christmas song ""River"", which topped the UK Singles Chart, becoming her third UK number one single and the last UK number one song of the 2010s.[119]

On 13 March 2020, Goulding released the new single ""Worry About Me"" which was created in-collaboration with Blackbear.[120] In a radio interview with Heart the same month, she revealed that the album ""kind of comes in two parts"", adding that ""the first side is something written entirely by me which was fun and I wrote most of it in New York when I was living there a few years back. I play the guitar and I play the bass and piano and then I'm singing a lot of vocals. It's very classically influenced because I love classical music. There's a lot going on, it's a big soundscape and one big film. The second half is my kind of alter ego songs.""[121] On 21 May she released single ""Power"" and on 30 June single ""Slow Grenade"" with Lauv.

Goulding released her fourth studio album, Brightest Blue, on 17 July 2020. Originally scheduled for 5 June 2020, the album's release was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album debuted at the top of the UK Album Chart, becoming Goulding's third album to do so,[122] as well as at No. 2 in Scotland.[123] It reached the top 10 in Ireland[124] as well as the top 40 in over ten countries including Australia, Germany and the United States.

Goulding announced on an Instagram Q&A that she would be releasing new music which was not part of the Brightest Blue era at the end of January 2021.[125] On 21 January, she released a collaboration with electronic duo Silk City, titled ""New Love"".[126] On 30 September, Goulding performed ""Anything Could Happen"" as part of the opening ceremony for Expo 2020, held in Dubai.[127]

On 19 June 2022, Goulding performed at Rock in Rio in Lisbon, Portugal. After the concert, she announced that she would be releasing new music in July. The following day, she blacked out all her social media profiles.[128] Back in July 2021, during an interview with Joe Wicks, she described the forthcoming album as ""a dance record. It's electronic pop, a dance thing from outer space"".[129] On 4 July 2022, she announced the release of ""Easy Lover"" featuring Big Sean, which was released on 15 July.[130] The single did not enter the UK Singles Top 100, but peaked at number 31 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart Top 100.[131] It was followed by ""All by Myself"", a collaboration between Goulding and producers Alok and Sigala, on 7 October.[132] Goulding released the single ""Let It Die"" along with its video on 19 October and announced the same day that her fifth studio album Higher Than Heaven would be released on 3 February 2023.[133][134]

14,dominic fike,1852767,101298087,"Dominic David Fike (Born December 30, 1995) is an American Singer and Alternative hip-hop artist from Naples, Florida. Fike first received recognition after releasing several popular songs on the website SoundCloud. Following the release of his debut EP, Don't Forget About Me, Demos, he signed to Columbia Records. Fike's song ""3 Nights"" reached the top ten in multiple countries. He later collaborated with the band BROCKHAMPTON and singer Halsey. In June 2020, Fike released the single ""Chicken Tenders"". In July of the same year, he released the single ""Politics & Violence"". Fike's debut album, What Could Possibly Go Wrong, was released the same month. The album charted in the top 50 in multiple countries, including the United States and Australia.

In September 2020, Fike became a headliner for a concert series in the video game Roblox. A few months later, NME included Fike on their list of essential new artists for 2020. He recorded a cover of Paul McCartney's song ""The Kiss of Venus"" for the album McCartney III Imagined. In 2022, Fike became a cast member of the second season of Euphoria in his first main acting role as Elliot.

Dominic David Fike was born on December 30, 1995, in Naples, Florida. Fike grew up with a younger brother, Alex, a sister, Apple, and an older brother, Sean, and is of African-American, Filipino, and Haitian descent. Fike went to Estero High School and graduated in 2014. Fike was a fan of Jack Johnson, Blink-182, and Red Hot Chili Peppers. He first acquired a guitar at the age of ten and learned how to play songs by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

During his childhood, Fike recalled that he and his brothers had to take care of each other owing to his parents' frequent absence from his life. Throughout his childhood, Fike’s mother was in and out of jail, causing him to stay in different homes, including those of his older brother, relatives, or his parents' friends. Fike's childhood life was ""full of adventure,"" as he and his friends would spend time in a forested area near their neighborhood that they called the ""Forest of Avalon,"" where he said they would eat snacks and smoke cannabis. He and his older brother Sean would also hang out at the guest house of his friend Stefan’s home, called the ""Backhouse,"" where they would freestyle. Later, they coalesced into a formal rap collective that included members Slyte, Ike Lysergic, and Seno. They attracted an audience in the community and Fike formed a sub-group called Lame Boys ENT. In 2015, the group started to attract the local media's attention and got booked into music festivals.

Fike started uploading songs on the Internet in high school and the first song he uploaded on YouTube was a song called ""Not A Word"". He also put songs he recorded into tapes. Fike briefly enrolled in a college but dropped out in less than 3 days.

Fike first received recognition by making beats with his then producer, Hunter Pfeiffer (known as 54) leading to several popular songs on SoundCloud being published. He released his debut EP at the age of 21 in December 2017 as an independent artist, which was recorded while he was on house arrest for the battery of a police officer. He later went to serve time at Collier County Jail for violating that house arrest. The EP caught the attention of several record labels and sparked a bidding war. After being released in April 2018, he signed with Columbia for a reported $4 million in August. All his previous work including the EP was pulled from all streaming services during the bidding war. Fike said the ultimate decision to join a record label was to pay for his mother's lawyer fee, who was facing drug charges at the time.

The EP was released again by Columbia on October 16, 2018. ""3 Nights"" was released as a single the same year. The single gained wide attention and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. It had an acoustic guitar sound compared to the music of Jack Johnson. It was placed on rotation on several radio stations and Spotify playlists and received favorable reviews from outlets such as Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, and Billboard. In reference to the EP, Billboard described Fike as a ""genre-meshing"" artist, and later named him a breakout act to watch, calling ""3 Nights"" a ""Motown-tinged breakout track"" that is ""trend-proof and irresistible"".

In January 2019, Fike revealed he was working on an album. On April 4, 2019, Brockhampton uploaded a video to their YouTube channel called ""This is Dominic Fike"" which included his song ""3 Nights"". As of April 2019, multiple collaborations with Brockhampton's Kevin Abstract have been posted, reaching over 4 million views.

On June 7, 2019, he released two singles, ""Açaí Bowl"" and ""Rollerblades"". He followed these with another single, ""Phone Numbers,"" produced by Kenny Beats, on July 4, 2019. The music video for this song was released on October 15, 2019. Fike announced on July 9, 2019, that he would be going on a tour titled Rain or Shine later in the year. The North American leg of the tour began August 31 in Philadelphia and ended October 3 in Los Angeles. In September 2019, he announced that he would be doing a clothing collaboration with Marc Jacobs. On the fifth day of that month, he performed a song that was unreleased at the time, Chicken Tenders, at a Chicago concert during his Rain or Shine tour.

Fike is featured on the track Dominic's Interlude on Halsey's third album, Manic, which was released on January 17, 2020. On June 26, 2020, Chicken Tenders, the first single from his then yet-to-be-named debut album, was released.

18,vacations,1467397,49610295,"There are multiple artists that perform under the name Vacations:

1. An alternative rock group based in Newcastle, Australia. Comprised of Campbell Burns, Jake Johnson, Nate Delizzotti and Joseph Van Lier. The pleasant sounds of the four piece  have earned them love at home and across the sea. Their music could be faithfully summarised as vibes, fitting somewhere in the shoeboxes of indie rock and glistening psych-pop. Their latest release (appropriately titled Vibes) features the tuneful croons of the singer Campbell Burns between shining, chorus-heavy guitars, bobbing bass and brushy jazz-rock drumming (worth a listen for fans of Morrissey and/or Mac Demarco). The band have just released a single that is the first taste of an album to come in 2018.

2. Members from Chin Up Chin Up formed a new band

Vacations was conceived while Bobby, Greg & Jeremy were wandering around Europe somewhere, on tour with their old band Chin Up Chin Up. They decided it’d be fun to try to start a new band without any guitar. The group they came up with is damn near the realization of that dream. They’re not completely devoid of or anti-guitar, but it certainly isn’t the heart of the matter anymore like it’s been for most of their musical lives. Ukulele, kalimba and karimba (those are both types of African thumb pianos – I just found that out from Wikipedia, too, it’s okay) are the sonic bread and butter for a band that has no real place on the map globally. 

In all honesty, Vacations is the sound of three guys making music who just don’t give a fuck anymore, and I mean that in the best of all possible ways. These three have spent years busting their asses trying to make it in music with their old bands (Chin Up, Make Believe, White Savage, Love of Everything, Hertzsprung Gap…) and making it just got old. Let’s face it. If it didn’t get old, they’d get pathetic. But letting go and quitting are two very different things. Vacations started as a way for the members to make music for themselves and leave the rat race (yes, I said it – the rat race of indie music. Trust me. It exists.) behind. They’ve brought back the whole reason they started making music in the first place: to make fun for themselves, their friends and hopefully their friends’ friends all over the place. It’s good-natured, revelry-inspiring, bizarro camaraderie in song. 

You can feel it from the first warm and plaintive notes of “I Was Bikini.” It’s something that instantly feels nostalgic and wistful for a good time you can’t even remember having anymore, but you’re pretty sure is still lingering in your bones or your blood-stream somewhere. It’s a feeling found in most of Vacations’ songs, propelled by familiar melodies made out of seemingly unidentifiable timbres and a winded heartbeat of rhythms. And when Jeremy and Chicago’s favorite chanteuse Jeanine O’Toole (of the 1900s) tell you that they’ll “see you on the other side,” you’re so wrapped up by the song that you don’t even question it. 

Vacations make a sound that, amidst all the buzzwords and hype-machines, serves to remind you that music is the ultimate meme. It is what you make it and how you choose to let people hear it. So staying true to what it once inherently meant to be an independent band, Vacations decided to forego what is now the obvious band routine. The pattern of “make an album, make someone put it out and make it sell” is not for them. They’ve retreated to the DIY-roots that abound in the songs they’re creating, but haven’t left the present tense behind. They brought it all back home. 

Their debut album is being released on Bobby’s own label, Record Label, instead of searching, shaking hands and hoping someone else will call it theirs. Yeah, I know. Nothing new. Greg Ginn and Ian MacKaye did it thirty years ago. That doesn’t make it any less admirable, though, especially in today’s oversaturated and over-funded transparency of a music scene. The real crazy and inspiring thing is, that their maiden voyage, I Was Bikini / But Rain Afraid, isn’t even really an album by any stretch of the contemporary terms.

Like I was saying earlier, I Was Bikini / But Rain Afraid is living in the present. An analog/digital choose-your-own adventure if you will. The vinyl enthusiasts can get their fix via the I Was Bikini 7”, a format that our economy’s coming dangerously close to making extinct despite the general vinyl renaissance. Yet, the best part is if you want the tangible, the time constraints of the disc don’t come into play anymore. Not only does the 7” come with a code to download the five songs on the record, but it also unlocks the album’s other eight songs housed on But Rain Afraid. Vacations aren’t vinyl elitists, though, nor are they classists. The whole of the album, all thirteen songs, will be made available from the band’s own web home for a pay-what-you-want-just-pay-something price. I know this is a lot to digest, but honestly, what could be better? You get to decide what Vacations’ music is worth to you and what it looks like. No questions asked.

In the end, this is open-endedness enables what the guys in Vacations really want. They want to engage you. They want you to listen to the story they’re spinning in notes and words. They want to make you part of the music they’re making and the fun they’re having. They’re getting back to the roots they never knew and they want to meet you somewhere in the middle of the expanse for the hang of a lifetime.  - Jesse Woghin

19,mgmt,4529525,170921826,"MGMT is an American alternative band which formed in 2002 in Middletown, Connecticut, United States. The band's founding members, Andrew VanWyngarden (lead vocalist, primary songwriter, multi-instrumentalist) and Ben Goldwasser (backing vocalist, multi-instrumentalist), met while attending Wesleyan University, and have remained as the core of the group to this day.

They intially named their project The Management, under which they recorded two demo EPs (which ended up being unofficially leaked online in 2005 as Climbing to New Lows), but changed their name to MGMT upon learning that another band had already been using their prior choice. Following this change, the band was signed to Cantora Records and released an EP entitled Time To Pretend - as VanWyngarden and Goldwasser had since graduated from Wesleyan, they gained the ability to tour more expansively in support of this release.

The duo was signed to Columbia Records in 2006, having caught the label's interest with their prior EP. They released their debut studio album, Oracular Spectacular the following year and quickly gained the attention of media journalists, other renowned musicians (such as Bruce Springsteen and Paul McCartney), and the general music industry alike. 

Their sophomore album, Congratulations, was released in 2010 and was notable for showcasing the band's matured sound, though this aspect made the album less appealing to much of their audience compared to their debut. Initially, the band had stated a desire not to release singles prior to the release of the album, but ended up making lead single ""Flash Delirium available on their website a month before the album's release. Due to the album having been leaked online, it was made available to stream for free on their website three weeks prior to its release date. 

In 2013, the band's third album, MGMT was released alongside an accompanying visualizer entitled ""The Optimizer"" meant to be played alongside the album. The album, which features a cover of the Faine Jade song ""Introspection"", continued the band's ongoing path of making more experimental music with heavier production - which subsequently meant that many critics found it even more confusing. The band took a brief break following the culmination of this album's promotional tour during which VanWyngard and Goldwasser focused on their own personal lives.

Having regrouped in late 2015, the band experienced what they referred to as ""writer's block"" which resulted in stagnancy within their recording sessions. After gaining a different perspective from their newly-hired producer Patrick Wimberly, however, the band decided for the first time to open their songwriting process and collaborate with other artists - in particular, VanWyngarden credited Ariel Pink for enabling him to feel more relaxed and open to a more spontaneous approach to songwriting. In 2018, the band released their fourth studio album, Little Dark Age, which showcased their return to a looser, more pop-like sound.

In 2019, the band parted ways with Columbia and began releasing music on their own independent label, beginning in December of that year with ""In The Afternoon"" followed by ""As You Move Through The World"" three months later. However, the band proceeded to go on an informal hiatus for the next four years.

The band announced in 2023 that they were planning to release a new album and go on tour again that year, and in October of that year they announced their fifth studio album, Loss Of Life, which ended up releasing in early 2024. The album features a much more contemporary sound in comparison to their prior releases, and includes their first-ever track featuring another artist, Dancing in Babylon (feat. Christine and the Queens).

Besides Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser, the band has included a number of touring members, some of whom also provided minor contribution to the band's studio recordings. These members include Hank Sullivant (guitar, keyboards), Matthew Asti (bass, backing vocals), James Richardson (drums, guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Will Berman (drums, percussion, harmonica, backing vocals), and Simon O'Connor (bass, backing vocals). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/MGMT"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

21,men i trust,1717203,86402801,"Men I Trust is Dragos, Emma, Jessy, Mathieu and Alexis. Founded in 2014, the indie dance band from Montreal, Canada loves smooth sounds, calm melodies and simple rhythms that relax, but make your right foot tap and your chin bounce on the beats. They record, mix, master and shoot their music videos. 

Jessy and Dragos knew each other since their fourth year of high school. Back then (mid-2000’s), Dragos had somewhat of a background in classical piano and Jessy mastered the dark and esoteric art of the metal guitar solist.

In 2012, while finishing his master’s degree in audio postproduction at Laval University, Dragos spent most of his days and sleeping hours at the “LARC” studio working on his solo projects. He randomly met Jessy again, who was finishing his bachelor degree in Jazz guitar, in one of the faculty’s hallways and talked about doing a French-Touch / Italo-Disco track together. Some weeks later, they did just that. And it worked out so well that they decided to extend their collaboration to a whole project where many singers such as Odile Marmet-Rochefort, Gabrielle Shonk, Helena Deland and Geoffroy Sauvé, would be involved.

Between 2012 and 2016, all of Jessy’s and Dragos’ releases were made as part of Dragos’ masters and (dropped) PhD studies in order to gain access to the LARC’s infrastructure and to develop a unique sound.


Emma was a fortuitous encounter. In 2015 a mutual friend presented her to Dragos through a video posted over the Internet. She was casually singing and playing the guitar around a campfire with some of her friends. Emma’s voice was different, being less clear, more grainy and fragile with a mysterious twist that caught their attention. They reached her and tried recording one song called “Out in myself”, which turned to be one of the band’s easiest to record.

Jessy and Dragos then invited her to join them on live shows with Odile at the beginning of 2015. The womans' voices blended wonderfully together and the band got lots of positive feedback from the experience. Emma has been part of Men I Trust since then.

With their second album “Headroom"", Men I Trust truly became a trio. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Men+I+Trust"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Valentín Oliva, (Buenos Aires, Argentina; 23 de enero de 1998) conocido artísticamente como Wos, es un rapero, freestyler argentino. Es conocido por ser el actual campeón en el torneo internacional de Red Bull Batalla de los Gallos.

Carrera

Wos arrancó desde muy pequeño rapeando en las plazas y participando en competencias como El Quinto Escalón, donde ya demostraba un gran potencial y sobre todo mucho coraje. Pero fue en 2016 cuando demostró que su nivel estaba para mucho más que una plaza, ganando así varias fechas del Quinto Escalón, tirando acotes memorables, que se viralizaron mucho en las redes sociales y salió campeón de la fecha final, dejando en el camino a Dtoke en la primera ronda y derrotando en la final a Klan. Wos es uno de los que más veces logró ganar la competencia de El Quinto Escalón.

En el 2017 participó en la Final Nacional Red Bull Batalla de los Gallos por primera vez, donde salió campeón derrotando, entre otros, a Papo, uno de los candidatos en los Cuartos de final y a Klan en la final y así se clasificó a la Internacional que se llevó a cabo en México en la cual quedó segundo detrás de Aczino.

También participó en otras competencias como la Double AA que ganaría en Argentina. En la Red Bull Batalla de los Gallos Internacional 2018 se coronó campeón. En FMS Argentina 2018 Wos también salió victorioso después de ganarle en la final a Papo. También tuvo un papel protagonista en la película Las Vegas dirigida por Juan Villegas.

Actualmente en 2019 anunció su retiro de la FMS para desviar su atención a su carrera musical, sin embargo seguirá activo en otras competencias, como por ejemplo GodLevel, en la cual represento a Argentina junto a Papo y Trueno en la que quedaron subcampeones, y la final internacional de Red Bull 2019.

26,lord huron,1854161,51198537,"Lord Huron are an American alternative rock band founded by Ben Schneider, a Michigan-born visual arts major. 

Origins:
In the spring of 2010 Schneider traveled from Los Angeles to Northern Michigan. At Lake Huron, he developed songs for the first Lord Huron EP. He named the recording, Into the Sun. Upon his return to L.A., Schneider set to work putting a band together. The first to join him was his percussion-playing childhood friend Mark. Each of the band members of band hail from Michigan.

Into The Sun and Mighty
Lord Huron released two EPs in 2010, Into the Sun and Mighty. Pop & Hiss, the LA Times Music Blog, described Mighty as ""full of lush acoustic guitars and Midwestern-accented harmonies as warm as a winter fireplace, but it's the Caribbean-influenced percussion that fans Lord Huron's folk sound into flame,""and Pitchfork could only classify it as ""a stylistic superball, bouncing off any wall you put around it."" NPR's World Cafe wrote ""the band's lush harmonies are backed by a hazy whirlpool of polyrhythmic tropical drums and folk guitars.""
Despite the fact that Schneider played all of the instruments on both EPs, he has gathered a band for live performances, which have also gotten positive reviews. ""The totality of the experience was like being on hand for a combination drum circle, chamber performance, and Calypso street party,"" wrote LA Weekly.Some of the larger shows the band has performed at include Lollapalooza (2011) and Outside Lands (2011), as well as a marathon ten shows in four days at the SXSW (2011) music festival.

It wasn’t until four years later that Jordan called Marc to lend vocals to some demos, which were intended as a placeholder. As with the best of accidents, the two liked what they heard and Neil Frances was born.

Jordan grew up in Sydney, then spent time in London, before landing in Los Angeles. Marc, a California native, grew up outside of Los Angeles in Rancho Cucamonga, in a house across the street from his aunt, uncle and cousin. Since childhood, the two found themselves exposed to a range of music, from opera, disco, hip-hop and more, all of which informs their songwriting today.

These influences can be heard on Neil Frances’ dreamy debut EP, Took A While, consisting of five lustrous, reverberating dance tracks featuring one infectious melody after the other. Their sound caught the attention of Jungle and Poolside, who they toured with earlier this year. When the music discovery platform, The Wild Honey Pie first heard their music, they quickly invited them to play the launch of their Los Angeles dinner party series (held in early November) at Checker Hall. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Frances"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

29,molchat doma,862051,25867552,"Молчат Дома (English translation: The Houses Are Silent)  is a Belarusian post-punk band with lyrics sung in Russian. Currently a trio with Egor Shkutko on vocal duties, Roman Komogortsev on guitar, synths, and drum machine, and Pavel Kozlov on bass and synths. The trio have been dubbed “the Belarusian New Order of our generation”, but that’s not quite right – they have far more in common with the gloomy nihilism of that band’s forebearer, Joy Division, a bleak, claustrophobic quality that’s like sinking into a pool of tar. Formed in 2017, in their hometown of Minsk, the trio take inspiration from early 80s post-punk and new wave, a visceral, intense mix of metallic drums, ominous synths, and melancholic bass lines. Some tracks sound like they were conceived using basic Casio keyboard presets; others borrow from Krautrock’s motoric grooves. But all burn with a deep seated despair and frustration, Yegor Shkutko’s vocals sounding anguished and distant. The sparse, cold production of second album Etazhi also sounds oddly futuristic, the crushing soundtrack to some dank, cyberpunk dystopia.Their second LP, Этажи (pronounced Etazhi, meaning “Floors”) was released in 2018 on Berlin-based Detriti Records. It has sold out four times and is currently on its fifth repressing due to outstanding demand. Этажи has garnered over one million views on Youtube.

30,grandson,680872,19714924,"Grandson is an alternative artist hailing from Toronto, Canada. Born in the small town of Englewood New Jersey, he relocated to the cultural melting pot of Toronto at a young age, and grew up surrounded by music ranging from jazz to rock and roll to rap, dancehall and r&b. He began playing guitar and piano in high school.

At 17, he relocated to Montreal, QC to attend university, and began working in nightclubs cleaning tables and DJing. He started writing music at this time, incorporating the unique blend of sounds he grew up surrounded by. He started experimenting with music production and rapping in 2013, and dropped out of school to relocate to Los Angeles and pursue music full time.

Adopting the Grandson moniker while living in LA, he dove deeply into rock influences such as Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana, and Led Zeppelin, while also listening to rap/R&B music emerging out of Toronto and alternative acts such as Twenty One Pilots and Hiatus Kaiyote. He found a small community of musicians to work and perform with here in Los Angeles. The live tries to create a frantic, mosh pit-inducing cathartic release of energy for concert-goers, influenced by early punk and grunge music.

Searching for his voice and for meaning in today’s divisive, chaotic world, Grandson confronts the most pressing issues of his generation through his songwriting, such as financial inequality, governmental and environmental accountability, and social justice, giving these topics a soundtrack with a genuine sense of urgency and frustration. The music also touches on adolescence, relationships, and the insecurities and difficulties of growing up through your 20s. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Grandson"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

36,jungle,1360986,42282992,"There are several artists using the moniker 'Jungle'.

1.  Jungle is an English modern soul musical collective founded by childhood friends, Tom McFarland and Josh Lloyd-Watson.
 Jungle was formed at the beginning of 2013, choosing to put an aesthetic emphasis on the music’s surrounding artwork and videos, and not on the pairs' own identity, (McFarland and Lloyd-Watson came to be known as J and T). Throughout the following year Jungle developed its nature as a collective by working with different artists across diverse disciplines. To perform the music live, Jungle expanded to a seven-piece band, fronted by J and T. Their debut album Jungle was released through XL Recordings on 14 July 2014.  The album was met with great critical acclaim and was later shortlisted for the 2014 Mercury Prize. Their 2nd album, For Ever, was released on 14 September 2018.



2. Based in Ann Arbor, Michigan – “Jungle” is a world/rock/fusion power trio featuring Steve ""Muruga"" Booker on drums, Dave Sharp on bass, and Steven Springer on guitar. “Jungle” was formed in 2010 when Muruga, Dave, and Steven collaborated on a project at Muruga’s ""Sage Ct."" recording studio. While in studio they recorded their first album “Jungle.” Drawing from many influences like Coltrane, Hendrix, Funkadelic etc. they recorded the album live.

Steven ""Muruga"" Booker, born in Detroit, MI, is a world renowned drummer and percussionist with musical roots going back to the late 1950's when he played in the Detroit rock n roll band “The Low Rocks.” Muruga was inspired by the blues, rock, and soul of the Detroit scene. He played with the legendary bluesman John Lee Hooker. They were booked as Hooker and Booker. Muruga is also known for his drum solos at venues like the East Town and Chessmate in Detroit. Playing with many artists throughout his career some highlights include playing Woodstock in 1969 with Tim Hardin, performing at Carnegie Hall with Dave Brubeck, playing on Weather Reports “Sweet Nighter” in 1973, and collaborating with George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars from the late 70's to the present. In 1990 Muruga released the billboard charting album ""Blues from the Rainforest"" with Merl Saunders and Jerry Garcia. In 1991 he was a recipient of th Hiroshima Voices for Peace award. He is featured on the Chesky Records album ""Circle of Drums"" with Babatunde Olatunji and Sikiru Adepoju. Most recently Muruga has released several albums on the Italian label Qbico Records and his 2010 release ""Kiss of Peace"" is nominated for 2010 Detroit Music Award for outstanding world music recording.

Steven Springer grew up in Port of Spain, Trinidad and is an accomplished, soulful songwriter and innovative finger style guitarist, with his roots in reggae, soca and calypso. His unique musical style is a melting pot of jazz, reggae, Latin, blues, rock and R&B, which combine to form a refreshing exceptional sound. When watching Springer perform, audiences from around the world have been witnessed an artist delivering his music with energy, conviction and raw emotion. Born in Trinidad, in the West Indies, Steven Springer was inspired by the melodic lilting sound of soca and calypso. He started playing guitar at a young age. Steven was intrigued by the fusion of many cultures and the beautiful natural features of Trinidad. In his early twenties, Steven moved to Phoenix, Arizona and formed a band called Sanctuary. Touring worldwide, Springer was a featured artist at the 1988 World’s Fair in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, performing with the Trinidad Calypso Band. Upon returning to the United States, Springer joined Hugh Borde’s world famous Trinidad Tripoli Steel Band, performing and recording with them for over ten years. Currently, Steven also leads the band Tropicooljazz. Among other numerous awards and honors, Steven was chosen “Best Guitar Player,” every year from 1990 to 1993, at the annual Detroit Music Awards.

Dave Sharp, a native Detroiter, became devoted to jazz at the University of Michigan and gained his chops under the tutelage of renowned bassist Herbie Lewis (McCoy Tyner, Cannonball Adderly and Les McCann) in San Francisco, and virtuoso bassist, composer and bandleader Marion Hayden (Straight Ahead) in Detroit. As bassist and composer for the modern jazz ensemble “Spheres of In uence,” and touring bassist for the seminal rock band “The Melvins” (Atlantic Records), Sharp has already made a mark on the national scene. He lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan where he composes, records, teaches and performs with Jungle has his own band Dave Sharp's Secret Seven.



3.Nothing is known about this excellent late sixties album's makers. A reissue is now available, so you can hear how good it is for yourself! Early Morning Rising, Slave Ship, House Of Rooms and Gray Picnic are all loaded with nice guitar and organ, even frantic (if somewhat inept) drumming on occasion. The tracks have an atmospheric, open quality and the recording is superb. This is a lost gem. The reissue has a deluxe embossed cover. It was originally issued in a plain sleeve.

41,tom misch,681498,17816974,"“Apparently, I have a sound , and people can hear it,” Tom Misch claims modestly. For someone with a cohesive and sprawling body of mellow beats behind him, he seems mildly bewildered that this is the case. “I try so many genres that it’s hard sometimes to pinpoint. I guess my sound is uplifting, soulful, funky — and happy more than it is sad.” It’s a perfect description of his debut album, due in 2018, which brings together low-slung hip-hop beats, glittering disco, and noodling jazz instrumentation in a way only Misch can.

If Misch seems surprised, it’s because his fanbase has developed naturally. He never set out with any grand plan when he began making beats, and uploading roughly three tracks a week to Soundcloud at 16. “ I prefer a more organic approach to making music, but also to building a fanbase,” he reflects. “I don’t want a big push on my music as I don’t want to be as big as possible.” And yet, he’s rapidly become one of the U.K.’s most exciting emerging new artists, gaining 1.1 million monthly listeners on Spotify and playing a sold-out tour of the U.K., U.S. and Europe in 2016. Collaborating with a clutch of fellow trailblazers like Novelist, Loyle Carner, and Zak Abel, he’s accumulated a total of 75 million streams across all platforms to date — and it all started in his bedroom.

Misch’s earliest introduction to music came via his artistic family, including his psychiatrist father, a passionate violinist, who would take him to concerts and the opera as a child. He sang in a choir at school, and picked up the violin himself at the age of four. When one of his older sisters took up guitar and later abandoned it, nine-year-old Misch inherited the instrument, and taught himself to play Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Nirvana songs. Today, he also plays bass, banjo, and a smattering of keys.

It was one of his sister’s boyfriends who introduced him to the music of J Dilla at 15, and from then on, Misch was hooked. He took up Music Technology at school the following year, and began learning how to create his own “really chilled out, boom-bap kind of ‘90s hip-hop” on Logic Pro. “When I wasn’t at school, I’d be making beats,” he says. “It was just what I did.” As he began sharing his tunes on Soundcloud, he found the response was overwhelming. “You put songs out and you build a fanbase — it’s kind of addictive.”

A collaboration with his sister Laura, on the jazz-inflected “Follow,” was a major turning point for both siblings after it was uploaded to influencer YouTube channel Majestic Casual. The track features Laura on sax and Tom on beats and vocals, intertwined to mesmeric effect. “That was the point where I was like, okay, maybe I could do this as a career,” Misch reflects. “Suddenly it had 100,000 plays.” Shortly afterward, Soulection co-founder Joe Kay commented on one of Misch’s productions on Soundcloud, asking the teenage prodigy to guest on his radio show.

Soon afterward, in 2014, Misch contributed to Soulection’s White Label series, weaving together obscure jazz samples, guitar, and vocals to create the perfect summer listen (including the dreamy fan favourite “The Journey”). His Beat Tape series collected the best of his hip-hop instrumentals, the 5 Day Mischon project featured collaborations with grime MC Novelist and singer-songwriter Zak Abel, and his 2016 Reverie EP brought the official release of Misch’s most sophisticated songs to date. As well as soulful singers Carmody and Jordan Rakei, he struck up a collaborative relationship with fellow south Londoner Loyle Carner, whose mellow bars flow over Misch’s productions like a breeze on a hot day. Both artists form part of the much-hyped scene of singer-songwriters emerging from south east London, including King Krule and Cosmo Pyke. Each has a DIY mindset and a brooding, poetic approach to lyricism that weaves them loosely together. “There’s definitely a certain sound,” reflects Misch. “Everyone’s music in south London is really chilled. It reflects the vibe of this part of London — it’s laid back.”

Misch has lived in south London all his life, and he loves it so much that his new single, “South of the River,” is dedicated to it. “I much prefer the general vibe of south London,” he says. “I love this area, Peckham, Dulwich, Forest Hill. Singing that line — You should come south of the river — it just felt really good.” With its string arrangements mirroring disco synth stabs and a funky bassline, it’s an irresistible bop that nods clearly to Misch’s danceable new direction.

One of the biggest influences on Misch’s sound has long been jazz. With a degree in jazz guitar, Misch is an avid listener of Robert Glasper, Roy Hargrove, Cory Henry, and jazz-influenced songwriters like D’Angelo and Erykah Badu. “It’s kind of a warm feeling, when you hear a certain chord progression,” he explains.

In the making of his debut album, he’s also been drawing on inspiration from disco, house, and techno, discovered through the portal of producers like Kaytranada and Motor City Drum Ensemble. The euphoric feel of 1970s and ‘80s disco (think Earth Wind and Fire or Gwen McCrae), and the thump of nightclubs like Fabric or Corsica, inspired him to bring more movement into his songs. “I want people to dance at my live shows, I want to bring more energy,” he says. “When you’re in a club and you can feel the bass...I want people to have that experience.”

Misch’s sound is true to its roots — he still makes his tracks in the same bedroom studio in his parents’ house, and his mum produces his artwork. (“ Her work is very DIY, just like my music, and feels homespun,” he explains.) But he’s never afraid to explore new territory. “I think it’s really important to make music that hasn’t been made before,” he says. “I’m trying to work out what my sound is, and pursuing that.” Fans might think they know his style, but Misch is a restless experimentalist, keen to spend endless hours honing his craft. One of his favorite new songs is a “Brazilian-sounding” jam that reflects how deeply he feels about his work. As he puts it: “It’s about how you can’t take away my love for music. I’ll always have that.” <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Misch"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This unusual melting-pot of contributions means LEISURE is greater than the sum of its parts, each member bringing different influences from 70s funk, to 90s rap and R&B, all the way to dance music from the early 2000s. Each member also brings a different skill set – strong pop song writing sensibilities, experimental production techniques, and the talent to mix and master their own work.

Having amassed over 60 million streams on their debut album, which entered at #2 in the NZ charts, they have built a rabid fan following that has seen their very occasional live shows sell out and become the stuff of legends – recently performing their debut, backed by the 72-piece Auckland Philharmonic Orchestra, to a sold-out Auckland Town Hall.

Their music has become a staple in the sync world, they have collaborated with hip-hop star, Goldlink, and have now signed globally to US / UK record label Nettwerk for their forthcoming album.

Their self-titled debut album release was critically acclaimed and with their sophomore album complete, fans worldwide continue to connect with their manifesto of living the good life, and their over-riding code to “keep things LEISURE”.

2) Leisure is a band from Boston, MA consisting of Jed Rouhana, Sam Hamad, and Chris Link. The three members played in bands together since High School. In 2010, they gave a demo CD to JR White of the San Francisco band Girls, during one of Girls' Boston shows. The CD included ""It's Alright (On The Suez Canal)"". White subsequently invited Leisure to open on their US tour. After touring, Leisure began work on their debut album ""Plastic Soul"", which they self-produced. The album is set to be released in 2012. More information can be found on their official website,www.leisureofficial.com and facebook page, www.facebook.com/leisuremusic

3) Leisure featured Middle Class Rut hitmakers Zack Lopez and Sean Stockham and a rotating cast of singers. The earliest incarnation of the band, which included D. Scott Sault, who would later front the short-lived Atlantic Records act Quitter, self-released an EP, Polygraph Alliance, in 1999. After Sault's departure the band briefly included Die Trying (Island) frontman Jassen Jensen. The band eventually landed a deal with Dreamworks, then fronted by Darren, and, shortly thereafter, at least briefly, ex-Hotwire frontman Rus Martin stepped in. The band's one and only national tour was opening for CKY. No word on if an album was ever completed, though several demos, some more impressive (""Deathtrap"") than others, do exist. 

4) Leisure was formed 1998 in New York City. They play non-Britpop and sing about faith, hope and love. Drew sings/play guitar, Peter plays keys/sings, Steve plays bass and Ted plays guitar/sings. They had recorded 2 EP’s (Occasional Music 1.0 & 2.0) with SoundOptik (Ryan Adams, The Strokes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion), Jesse Sprinkle (Poor Old Lu, Serene UK, Starflyer 59) and Andrew D. Prickett (The Violet Burning, Cush, The Prayer Chain). Their music can be heard on XM Satellite Radio.

5) Leisure is still a young band but has some experience however. Formed in November 2004 with the idea of playing only covers. In view of the result of exalting rehearsals, the band decided quickly, under the impulse of Francois, the bands songwriter, to create a set entirely made of their own compositions. The band chose clearly its style, under the British influence and sensitive to each decade (from The Beatles, the Kinks to The Libertines as well as Oasis). Leisure is made up of five members : a drummer with a heavy strike (Nessim, 23), a bassist who gives a certain feminine touch to the band (Coralie, 19), a rhythmical thorough guitarist (Nicolas, 22), a soloist gifted guitarist (Francois, 21) and a charismatic singer (Siamack, 20). The year 2005 has meant toil for the band, accumulating compositions and hours of intensive rehearsals. The band performed at that time in the main venues of Bordeaux, like lInca, lAssonette, la Centrale and some open air gigs like the participation to the festival « Tête de lArt ». At the end of the year, Leisure recorded his first demo called « Shoots in the Streets », recorded and mixed by Kim, produced by the band itself and containing five of their songs played live. The year 2006 is promising for the band which had the honor to play in renowned places such as lHeretic et le SonArt, still improving their set on stage and their compositions. They were also broadcasted several times on radios, like Radio Sauvagine (94.9 FM). After having had the ambition to be known in Bordeaux, the band thinks of exporting itself little by little in whole France. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Leisure"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

50,rainbow kitten surprise,841384,30762916,"Rainbow Kitten Surprise and all five of its members hail from the mountains of Boone, North Carolina. With catchy, yet deep lyrical meaning, beautifully designed bass lines, and melodic guitar riffs, their unique sound will keep you humming their tunes all day long. The Alternative/Indie-Pop band takes influence from great artists like Modest Mouse, Lana Del Rey, and Kings of Leon.

RKS was formed in early 2013 when the first two members, Ela Melo and Darrick ""Bozzy"" Keller, decided to begin writing and composing music together. What started out as just two college students with acoustic guitars, would soon turn into a full band with a uniquely controversial name.

After recording RKS's first EP ""Mary"" in an old dorm room on the campus of Appalachian State University, the duo decided to take it up a notch by adding more members and instruments to the band. Over the next year the group widely expanded in size and sound by adding three more members: Ethan Goodpaster (Electric Guitar), Jess Haney (Drums), and Charlie Holt (Bass). In that year, RKS independently released their first album ""Seven"" (Which was later re-released in combination with the band's first EP as a joint album titled ""Seven + Mary""). The title song, ""Seven"" has been featured in many places on the web including in the very popular podcast by IGN, Podcast Beyond! The song ""Devil Like Me"" and its music video earned the band a spot in VH1's ""Make A Band Famous"" contest where they made it to the final 24 out of thousands of artists from across the US.

The group's main interest is producing a quality, unique, and fresh sound for all music lovers to listen to and enjoy. Their new album ""RKS!

She and her partner Josh Conway, the drummer, met at a show at the Kibitz Room, the bar and music venue inside Canter's Deli in Los Angeles.

53,ray lamontagne,1393766,24901872,"Raymond Charles Jack LaMontagne (born June 18, 1973) is an American songwriter, singer and musician. LaMontagne has released eight studio albums, Trouble, Till the Sun Turns Black, Gossip in the Grain, God Willin' & the Creek Don't Rise, Supernova, Ouroboros, Part of the Light, and Monovision. He was born in New Hampshire and was inspired to create music after hearing an album by Stephen Stills. Critics have compared LaMontagne's music to that of Otis Redding, The Band, Van Morrison, Nick Drake and Tim Buckley.

Early life
LaMontagne was born in Nashua, New Hampshire, in 1973, one of six children raised by his mother. In his early teens he lived in Morgan, Utah, and was more interested in drawing images of Dungeons & Dragons than in his school work. After graduating from high school, LaMontagne moved to Lewiston, Maine, and found work in a shoe factory. LaMontagne also spent a significant amount of time in Wilton, Maine. Other sources state that by his teen years he was living in Maine, spending time in Turner and Buckfield.

Style
LaMontagne has a unique vocal style which he says is created by singing through his gut instead of through his nose. He cites Stephen Stills, Richard Manuel, and Rick Danko as strong musical influences while critics have compared LaMontagne's music to that of The Band, Van Morrison, Nick Drake, and Tim Buckley.[failed verification] A Rolling Stone review of his album Supernova referred to his voice as an ""impeccably weathered tenor croon"" and his phrasing as ""marble-mouthed.""

Awards
For his debut album, LaMontagne won four awards, including three Boston Music Awards (Best Male Singer-Songwriter, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year) and an XM Nation Music Award for Acoustic Rock Artist of the Year. LaMontagne has received a nomination from the Pollstar Concert Industry Awards for Best New Touring Artist, the BRIT Awards for International Breakthrough Act, the MOJO Awards for Best New Act, and was given the title of Best Voice in 2006 by Esquire.

In 2011, Ray LaMontagne and the Pariah Dogs received two Grammy Award nominations, and they were awarded the Grammy for the Best Contemporary Folk Album for God Willin' & the Creek Don't Rise.

Controversy
On July 23, 2014, during a show at the Meijer Gardens in Grand Rapids, Michigan, LaMontagne interrupted a song and walked off stage as a result of two fans talking during his concert, after having previously asked the audience to quiet down. The incident included yelling profanity at the couple before walking off stage. Once the couple was escorted away LaMontagne continued the concert.

On September 20, 2016, LaMontagne announced that he was canceling a September 22 show at the Bass Concert Hall at the University of Texas at Austin, due to Texas's recently implemented campus carry law.

Personal life
In 2009, LaMontagne paid $1.05 million for a 103-acre farm in Ashfield, Massachusetts, the former residence of U.S. Ambassador William C. Bullitt, where he lives with his wife, Sarah Sousa, and their two children in the farmhouse built in 1830. Sousa is a published poet via Red Mountain Press and their sons are budding artists.

56,old sea brigade,259147,2333031,"The nom de plume of Atlanta, Georgia-raised, Nashville-based singer/songwriter Ben Cramer, Old Sea Brigade emerged in 2016 with a critically lauded EP that featured a compelling, heartfelt, and atmospheric blend of folk, country, Americana, and indie rock that invoked names like Bon Iver, Iron and Wine, and the National. A string of singles and an EP for the Nettwerk label paved the way for his 2019 full-length debut, Ode to a Friend.

After several years playing in bands around the Atlanta area, Cramer decided to forge ahead as a solo act, adopting the Old Sea Brigade name in 2015. Self-released in 2016, his eponymous debut EP earned him enough buzz to land key support slots for Hiss Golden Messenger, Julien Baker, and Benjamin Francis Leftwich during his first U.S. tour. Later that year, he inked a deal with Nettwerk and began work on a follow-up release. Cramer's first single for Nettwerk, the rousing ""All the Same,"" dropped in September 2016 and was later included on 2017's Wash Me Away, the first of three EPs he would issue that year. The song ""Tidal Wave,"" from his next EP, Cover My Own, notched significant play on streaming networks. Cramer closed out a banner year with the Christmas EP Songs for the Holidays.

58,manchester orchestra,1313638,38484938,"Manchester Orchestra is an American indie rock band which formed in Atlanta, Georgia in 2004. The group is currently composed of rhythm guitarist, singer/songwriter Andy Hull, lead guitarist Robert McDowell, keyboardist and percussionist Chris Freeman, bassist Jonathan Corley and drummer Tim Very. Former drummer Jeremiah Edmond parted ways with the band in January 2010 to focus on his family as well as running the band's record label, Favorite Gentlemen. 

Manchester Orchestra has released several extended plays and six studio albums: I'm Like A Virgin Losing A Child (2006), Mean Everything to Nothing (2009), Simple Math (2011), Cope (2014) (as well as its accompanying acoustic version, Hope), A Black Mile To The Surface (2017), and  The Million Masks of God (2021). They are signed to independent record label Favorite Gentlemen Recordings, which is distributed through Sony Music Entertainment, and Loma Vista Recordings. 

Manchester Orchestra originated in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. They are named after the English city Manchester, a place rich in musical history (The Smiths, The Stone Roses, Joy Division, Oasis, New Order, Happy Mondays). Feeling increasingly alienated at his ""small-town-Georgia, Christian high school"", Hull became so frustrated that he spent his senior year studying at home. Early in their career, the band recorded an album entitled Nobody Sings Anymore. However, it was never released due to the shift in the band's musical direction and personal changes undergone following its recording. The band stated that ""the band that made the record was different to the band now."" Some of the tracks written for the album were released instead on the EP You Brainstorm, I Brainstorm, but Brilliance Needs a Good Editor.

Following  You Brainstorm, I Brainstorm, but Brilliance Needs a Good Editor, Manchester Orchestra recorded and released their debut album I'm Like a Virgin Losing a Child. This album gained the attention of the music industry, and eventually led to their signing with Canvasback. The album was released nationwide July 27, 2007. Guitarist Robert McDowell did not appear on this album. The song Wolves At Night was featured in the video game NHL 08.

In October of 2008 the band recorded their second EP, Let My Pride Be What's Left Behind, with producer Dan Hannon and engineer Brad Fisher. It was released October 7, 2008.

In early September 2008, the band announced on their Myspace blog that they had begun recording their second album entitled Mean Everything to Nothing with producer Joe Chicarrelli (The Shins, My Morning Jacket). On February 4, 2009, the band posted a link to a free download of the single I've Got Friends and performed an acoustic version at The Fly’s In The Courtyard Sessions. The album was released April 21, 2009.

On January 26, 2010, the band released a digital split EP with Kevin Devine entitled I Could Be The Only One. Following the release of the Manchester Orchestra/Kevin Devine split EP, it was announced that Kevin Devine would record a full-length album along with the members of Manchester Orchestra later that year, with half the album written by Devine and half by Andy Hull. On April 10, 2010, it was announced the new project's name was Bad Books, and that the album would be released under that moniker, and not ""Manchester Orchestra + Kevin Devine"" as previously speculated. The self-titled full-length Bad Books album was digitally released on October 19, 2010, and on CD on November 9, 2010.

On March 2010, in an interview with the Dallas Observer, Hull mentioned that the band had begun work on a follow up to 2009's Mean Everything to Nothing tentatively entitled Let Go of Your Sorrowful Groaning. He also said that the band have around 34 songs they are demoing and that in writing this album he was imagining a ""spiritual miscarriage"". Later that year in an interview with Rip It Up magazine, the band announced that they were in the middle of recording their third full-length album. Although without a title, they explained that the album was completely different to anything they had released in the past. The album was being recorded with Dan Hannon and balanced between Blackbird Studios (Nashville, TN) and their own Favorite Gentlemen Studios (Atlanta, GA).

On October 23, 2010, during an appearance at Radio 104.5 in Philadelphia, following a Bad Books show in support of their recently released self-titled debut album, Manchester Orchestra debuted an acoustic version of the title track of their new album, Simple Math. Originally scheduled for release in March 2011, the band announced in January of 2011 that their third full-length studio album, Simple Math, would be released on May 10, 2011, as well as announcing the album's tracklist and revealing that the album was set to be a concept album.

59,maribou state,536495,11426213,"Maribou State is Chris Davids and Liam Ivory from Hertfordshire. Liam asked Chris to play bass for his band. When they moved up north to go to university, the band fell by the wayside and the pair began making electronic music in their home studio, forging a partnership that would soon become Maribou State.

In the summer of 2011 they were scouted by Fat! Records and put out their debut release, the 'Olivia' EP, which set a blueprint for Maribou State's trademark bass-heavy, melodic sound. Grassroots support for the duo was also building. When they brought out a bootleg of Lauryn Hill's 'Doo Wop' (produced in collaboration with Pedestrian), the tune racked up thousands of plays on YouTube and got airtime on Radio 1, 1Xtra and XFM courtesy of Diplo, B. Traits and Eddy Temple Morris respectively.

Their first project for Southern Fried was a remix of 'Hummus' by Crookers, which hit the top of the Hype Machine chart during the spring of 2012. Then the 'Native' EP dropped in June and one of the tracks from it, 'The Look', was promptly given 10/10 and awarded Tune Of The Month by Mixmag. Along with underground fans, key tastemakers were beginning to take note.

Momentum continued when, after a summer spent playing shows, the next single for Southern Fried was released. 'Scarlett Groove' (featuring Saint Saviour) was a certified off-kilter pop hit, notching up radio play from Annie Mac and Lauren Laverne as well as being given Essential Tune status by Pete Tong. It was an excellent way to round off 2012, a year made all the nicer when Maribou State's remix of Ultraista's 'Gold Dayzz' went viral, plonking the pair at the top of the Hype Machine chart once again and hitting over 200,000 plays on SoundCloud.

Their first major release of this year was another collaboration with Pedestrian. Signed by Polish house duo Catz 'N Dogz and put out via their Pets imprint, 'Mask' pushed Maribou State firmly to the fore of the British scene, running alongside Disclosure, Bondax and AlunaGeorge as artists dedicated to making accessible yet highly inventive dance music. The record also gained further radio play from Zane Lowe, Hugh Stephens and Rob Da Bank, as well as long-time supporters Annie Mac, B. Traits and Pete Tong.

As 2013 began to unfurl, Chris and Liam will release their latest single for Southern Fried, a record that marks the next stage of their career. A double-A side including 'Tongue' and 'Larks Rise', it sees them realise their vision of creating organic dance music in the same kind of way as Bonobo and Four Tet, forging field recordings and live instrumentation with broken house rhythms and waves of sub-bass.

61,flora cash,463972,5452928,"Flora Cash is a Swedish–American musical partnership consisting of Shpresa Lleshaj and Cole Randall. The pair work primarily in music but also collaborate in other fields under that moniker. 

Lleshaj, an Albanian originally from Kosovo, whose family fled to Sweden while she was a child to escape war and conflict in the region, was living in Stockholm when she met Randall, from Minneapolis, on SoundCloud in 2012. Lleshaj began commenting on the tracks Randall had posted and the two discovered they appreciated each other's music. After meeting in person in Minneapolis, they began working together in Sweden as Flora Cash. The duo has said that they've never revealed the origin or meaning of their band name to anyone.

In 2012, the pair met on SoundCloud and struck up a musical connection, leading Shpresa Lleshaj to travel from Stockholm to Minneapolis to meet Cole Randall in person. They returned to Sweden together and immediately began work as Flora Cash. 

They released their debut EP, Mighty Fine, on December 12, 2012. Their second EP, Made It for You, came out on June 13, 2013. That year, Lleshaj and Randall also married. A third EP, I Will Be There, followed on September 20, 2014.

After independently releasing a handful of songs and two EPs, the pair signed with Swedish label Icons Creating Evil Art, after which they released, Can Summer Love Last Forever?, in March 2016. The seven-song mini-LP earned them nominations for two GAFFA awards, as Swedish Artist of the Year and Swedish Newcomer of the Year.

Flora Cash broke into the mainstream with their song “You’re Somebody Else”; a track from their debut full-length album, Nothing Lasts Forever (And It’s Fine), which Steve Baltin, writing for Forbes Magazine called “arguably the most intriguing song on radio this past year.”. The song reached #1 on Alternative Radio and achieved RIAA Platinum Certification in the United States.

The duo performed several times on American television after making their debut on The Late Late Show with James Corden and toured with Sir Sly, Joywave, lovelytheband, Judah & the Lion and AJR throughout 2018 and 2019.

65,vansire,1436274,31245916,"Vansire is a dream pop band from Rochester, Minnesota consisting of Josh Augustin and Sam Winemiller. They are currently signed to Spirit Goth Records. Vansire has performed at ROCKChester and First Avenue, played a live session with Audiotree, and collaborated with artists such as Chester Watson, Jeremiah Jae, and Mick Jenkins.

Vansire formed as band members Josh Augustin (vocals, synths, guitar, and drums) and Sam Winemiller (bass, guitar, and synths) were attending Century High School in Rochester, Minnesota. Augustin and Winemiller met while playing together on the school's drumline and continued to find themselves performing together through school activities (such as concert band and pit orchestra), something the duo says contributed to their creative synergy and friendship, which later helped in Vansire's formation.

In the summer of 2015, Winemiller approached Augustin after practice for the school's drumline with an idea to make a band ""that sounds like Mac [DeMarco]"". The pair's early recordings were made by holding instruments to the internal microphone of an iPad running GarageBand. Augustin and Winemiller, initially unsure of what to call their new project, turned to an online random word generator that landed on ""vansire"", an alternative name for the Marsh mongoose. From there, the two continued to record together in their basements, living rooms, and bedrooms under the new Vansire moniker.

In August 2016, Vansire self-released their first album, ""Reflections and Reveries"". The duo recorded the album entirely in Winemiller's basement in a roughly one-year period from August 2015 to August 2016, and included Winemiller's brother, Issac, on bass for some songs.

During this time, Augustin began studying at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and Oberlin College, while Winemiller started at the University of Minnesota. Despite the distance, the duo vowed to remain committed to the Vansire project, now describing it as ""a long-distance band relationship.""

Vansire released their second album Angel Youth in April 2018 on Spirit Goth Records. Augustin and Winemiller produced and mastered the album themselves, and it is the band's first full-length album that featured collaborations with other artists.

In June 2019, the duo released their single ""Metamodernity"", also recording an Audiotree Live session at Audiotree's studios in Chicago later that August.

In July 2020, Vansire released ""Central Time"", a single featuring Chicago-based rapper Mick Jenkins in their first collaboration together. In an interview announcing the single, Augustin said the single began as an instrumental demo that Winemiller sent him in September 2019, which sat untouched for roughly eight months until the duo returned back to it, finishing it up at the beginning of June 2020.

During this period of the band's history, Augustin said that Vansire found itself leaning in an ""increasingly dance-oriented direction"" with regard to musical sound and that the duo has started to draw influence from more ""dancey, funk-imbued music"".

On October 16, 2020, Vansire released ""After Fillmore County"", a seven-song EP that brought back FLOOR CRY, and featured Philadelphia-based rapper Ivy Sole. In April 2021, Vansire released a remix of Sydney-based producer-artist Swaine Delgado's ""F Me Up"", their first remix. In May 2022, Vansire released their third LP, The Modern Western World"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Vansire"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

67,fleet foxes,2288141,103383555,"Fleet Foxes is an American indie folk band formed in Seattle, Washington in 2006. The band consists of Robin Pecknold (vocals, guitar), Skyler Skjelset (guitar, mandolin, backing vocals), Casey Wescott (keyboards, mandolin, backing vocals), Christian Wargo (bass, guitar, backing vocals) and Morgan Henderson (upright bass, guitar, woodwinds, violin, percussion, saxophone).

Led by singer-songwriter Robin Pecknold, the band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP Sun Giant and their debut album Fleet Foxes on Sub Pop. Both received critical praise and reviewers often noted the band's use of refined lyrics and vocal harmonies. Fleet Foxes' second studio album Helplessness Blues was released on Sub Pop in 2011. Following a hiatus between 2013 and 2016, during which Pecknold pursued an undergraduate degree, Fleet Foxes reunited to record their third album, Crack-Up, released on Nonesuch Records in 2017. The band's fourth album, Shore, was released on Anti- in September 2020.

Formation and early years (2005–06)
Robin Pecknold and Skyler Skjelset both attended Lake Washington High School in Kirkland, a suburb of Seattle, and soon became close friends. Pecknold and Skjelset bonded over an appreciation of Bob Dylan and Neil Young and began making music together. Their parents influenced their musical tastes early on—Skjelset's mother Peggi was a keen listener to both Dylan and Hank Williams while Pecknold's father Greg was a member of The Fathoms, a local 1960s soul group. The two shared an interest in the music of Dylan and Brian Wilson. Pecknold played bass for Seattle's Dolour on a US tour in 2005, shortly before forming the first incarnation of Fleet Foxes.

Originally going by the name ""The Pineapples"", a name clash with another local band prompted a change and Pecknold decided upon ""Fleet Foxes"", suggesting that it was ""evocative of some weird English activity like fox hunting"". Pecknold took up the role of principal songwriter, both singing and playing guitar, while Skjelset played lead guitar. The original lineup was filled out by Casey Wescott on keyboards and backing vocals, Bryn Lumsden on bass and Nicholas Peterson on drums and backing vocals.

Pecknold's late-sixties pop style caught the attention of the Seattle producer Phil Ek and he helped them record their first demo in 2006, the self-released Fleet Foxes EP. Ek was impressed with the band's songwriting, and on hearing Pecknold for the first time, noted, ""It was obvious he had talent coming out of his ass."" By late 2006 the Seattle press began to take notice of the band; Tom Scanlon of the Seattle Times stated that he was impressed with the band's lyrics and musical maturity. By the end of the year, Lumsden had been replaced on bass by Craig Curran, who would also handle many of the band's vocal harmonies.

With growing popularity on the local circuit, the band set about making their first album in early 2007, spending time in the studio with producer Ek in addition to recording material at home. However, funds for recording were tight, so the band members cobbled together what funds they had, which limited the time they had in the studio, and so the majority of the tracks were recorded in various band members' apartments, other spaces, or the basement of Pecknold's parents' house.

Sun Giant and Fleet Foxes (2007–08)
Fleet Foxes were becoming increasingly popular and by late 2007, they had attracted over a quarter of a million song plays over two months on their Myspace site. Although the band had not released any of their recordings, they benefited from word of mouth exposure and their success soon translated into a record deal, signing with Warner Music subsidiary record label Sub Pop on January 18, 2008. According to Sub Pop's A&R, Sue Busch, at the time of signing the band was still a relatively primitive set-up, being without manager or legal representation. Robin's sister Aja Pecknold then assumed the role of band manager. The band's frontman, Robin Pecknold, attributes much of their success and popularity to illegal file sharing.

The band tracked their second EP, Sun Giant, at Bear Creek Studio and performed overdubs and mixed at Seattle's Avast! Recording Co., around the same time in preparation for upcoming tours. Fleet Foxes began their spring tour with another Northwest band Blitzen Trapper on February 28, 2008. Before the recording of the EP, bassist Curran was replaced by Christian Wargo, whose voice, like that of his predecessor, would become an important part of the band's harmony blend. The band's performances, first at the SXSW festival in March 2008, and then the Sasquatch! festival in May 2008, moved the band into the public consciousness, notably attracting attention from the European press for the first time.

Sun Giant was released internationally on April 8, 2008 and the group's brand of folk, rock and pop, marked by their use of vocal harmonies, was well received by the press. Despite the warm critical reception, the group said that the EP did not represent their full ambitions, serving merely as a CD to sell while on tour. In May 2008, the band chose to extend their North American and European tour until September in support of their forthcoming album. At this time Josh Tillman replaced Peterson on drums and backing vocals. Their first full-length album, Fleet Foxes, was released shortly afterwards on June 3, 2008. The album achieved similar critical success as the previous EP. Fleet Foxes received four out of five stars from Rolling Stone, which compared it to the likes of the Beach Boys, Animal Collective, and Crosby, Stills & Nash, and a 9.0 out of 10 in a review by Pitchfork Media, sharing the website's album of the year rank with the Sun Giant EP. The Guardian was particularly complimentary, awarding the album five stars and declaring it ""a landmark in American music — an instant classic"". On June 24, 2008, Fleet Foxes went to No. 1 on the CMJ Radio 200 Chart. The album achieved an average rating of 87/100 from 30 critic reviews on the aggregator website Metacritic.

While the group enjoyed moderate success in the United States, Fleet Foxes was better received in Europe, selling over 200,000 copies in the five months following its release. The sales were matched with critical plaudits and their debut album won Uncut's first ever Music Award 2008 prize. Uncut's editor, Allan Jones, said the album ""showed impeccable musicianship, and although you could trace its antecedents, it sounded totally unique. Fleet Foxes was just a glorious debut."" The band sold out music venues for their tours of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, reaffirming their growing popularity.

At the end of 2008, Fleet Foxes was rated album of the year by Billboard's Critic's Choice and in Metacritic's end of year best album round-up it appeared in 17 lists, topping six of them. Furthermore, it had sold over 408,000 copies in North America and over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom, making it the first gold certificate record for UK label Bella Union. Their growing profile enabled the band to make televised appearances, playing on Vincent Moon's La Blogotheque in December 2008 and on Saturday Night Live the following January. In 2009, they toured in Europe to favorable reviews; the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said their show in Paradiso induced goosebumps. In 2008 and 2009, the band played globally ending the tour in September with a final European leg.

Helplessness Blues (2009–12)
Pecknold said that he would have liked the album to be released in 2009; however, the band's touring schedule delayed rehearsals of the new songs until February 2009. These sessions took place in a rented house outside Seattle, but were mostly scrapped, losing the band $60,000 of their own money. Further delays ensued because the drummer, Tillman, was scheduled to play a solo tour in Europe and North America throughout the 2009–10 winter. Pecknold later sent some demos to producer Phil Ek and expressed the hope that the second LP would emerge in late 2010.

In December 2009, Pecknold said he wanted the new LP to sound ""less poppy, less upbeat and more groove-based"". He referenced the 12-string guitar sound from Roy Harper's folk album Stormcock, saying, ""That will be the primary sonic distancing from the last record."" He wanted the band to record very quickly, with ""vocal takes in one go, so even if there are fuck-ups, I want them to be on there. I want there to be guitar mistakes. I want there to be not totally flawless vocals. I want to record it and have that kind of cohesive sound. Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, to me, is the best-sounding album because it sounds like there were only six hours in the universe for that album to be recorded in. So I want it to have that feeling."" The band eventually began recording in April 2010 in various locations (including West Hurley, New York) under the label Reciprocal Recording and decided to scrap the earlier idea of a fast recording (though according to the band many of the initial vocals were done in one take). The album features a new six-piece band line up, with the addition of the former Blood Brothers bassist Morgan Henderson on upright bass and woodwind instruments.

The album, Helplessness Blues, was released on May 3, 2011 with a cover illustrated by the Seattle artist Toby Liebowitz and painted by Christopher Alderson. The title track was released via free download on January 31, 2011, and the album's fourth track, ""Battery Kinzie"", was premiered in the UK on Zane Lowe's radio show on March 22, 2011. The Sub Pop record label released a downloadable music video of the track ""Grown Ocean"", with footage of the album's recording, on its website in support of the album. A 12"" vinyl double A-side single of ""Helplessness Blues"" and ""Grown Ocean"" was released for Record Store Day on April 16, 2011. On November 1, 2011, Pecknold's brother, Sean Pecknold, released the official music video for ""The Shrine / An Argument"".

Helplessness Blues was nominated as Best Folk Album at the 2012 Grammy Awards, held February 12, 2012.

Departure of Tillman and hiatus (2012–2016)
On January 18, 2012, after the band had finished touring for the album, drummer Tillman announced that he had left the band. He would go on to reinvent himself and record several albums as Father John Misty, notable for his ironic sense of humor in lyrics and media as well as often criticizing both the record industry and society in interviews and on stage.

In October 2020, Pecknold reflected on Tillman's departure during a Reddit AMA: ""[Josh] ""quit"" the band after recording drums for Helplessness, got into narcotics and made his first Father John Misty album while I was making Helplessness in Seattle. Then Sub Pop offered to put out his album, but only if he delayed it for a year or so and toured Helplessness with us. Which we all weakly agreed to going through with, but it quickly became obvious he'd rather have just been doing that project instead, and I would have rathered that as well. So that tour I had to endure being around a lot of substance abuse, sabotaged shows, just general ill treatment, shit-talking, all while paying him for songs he didn't have anything to do with. It sucked!""

On June 15, 2013, an image of a home recording set-up–including a laptop computer, microphone and guitar–was posted on the Fleet Foxes Facebook page with the caption ""Step one"". On June 16, 2013, an image of a broken mandolin with the caption ""Step two"" was posted. These images were later deleted, but led to speculation that the group was working on a new project, possibly a third studio album. On April 23, 2014, Robin Pecknold posted to the band's Facebook page that he had moved to New York to get his undergraduate degree at the Columbia University School of General Studies, a liberal arts college of Columbia University in New York City.

Crack-Up (2016–2018)
On May 18, 2016, while answering fan questions on his Instagram account, Pecknold confirmed that Fleet Foxes were working on new material with drummer and frequent collaborator Neal Morgan, best known for his work with Joanna Newsom and Bill Callahan. Describing Morgan as a ""full Fox"", Pecknold also admitted he ""had to up my songwriting game for homeboy."" However, when Pecknold posted a photo of the band minus Morgan on Instagram, he clarified that Morgan was one of three drummers involved in the new album, and that for the time being Fleet Foxes would consist of Pecknold, Skjelset, Wescott, Wargo, and Henderson as a ""five-piece 'core band'"", but they would still use a drummer for live performances and additional musicians for certain shows. Pecknold also said that the new material would be ""a different vibe"" compared to Fleet Foxes' previous output. On November 14, 2016, the band confirmed (via their Facebook account) that their new album was nearly complete.

On December 25, 2016, Pecknold posted a photo on his Instagram account which showed four albums in the Fleet Foxes' queue in his iTunes library: the first studio album Fleet Foxes; the Sun Giant EP; the second studio album Helplessness Blues; and an unknown third album entitled Ylajali. This led to speculation that the band's third album would: 1) be named after a character from Knut Hamsun's novel Hunger; 2) contain a photo from Japanese photographer Hiroshi Hamaya as the cover art; and 3) be released through Nonesuch Records, since the label's logo can be seen on the album cover.

In an email newsletter on January 1, 2017, production company Mason Jar Music confirmed that Fleet Foxes was working on a new album, since they contributed to the production. The album was called Crack-Up, after an F. Scott Fitzgerald essay of the same name. The album is a concept album and was recorded at Electric Lady Studios and Sear Sound in New York City.

On March 7, 2017, Fleet Foxes announced their third studio album, Crack-Up, released on June 16, 2017 via Nonesuch Records, a new label for the band. The lead single, ""Third of May / Ōdaigahara"", was released the same day. On April 4, 2017, the band posted the album trailer for the new album on YouTube. The trailer briefly presents various songs from the album and shows some images while they were recording them. The video was made by Sean Pecknold, Robin's brother.

On May 15, 2017, Fleet Foxes made their live return at the Wilma Theatre in Missoula, in which they performed nine songs from Crack-Up along with a selection of older material and a cover of ""In the Morning"" by Bee Gees. The band's current live line-up includes Matt Barrick of The Walkmen, who is also the most heavily featured of the three guest drummers who contributed to Crack-Up. Barrick has continued to play with the band, but has not become an official member. The new album also included the sounds of a brass quartet called The Westerlies.

On October 10, 2017, the band announced the release of a new EP, entitled The Electric Lady Session, for Black Friday Record Store Day 2017. The EP was released on November 24 of that year, and is a collection of live performances of four songs from Crack-Up, originally recorded for their session at Fordham University’s radio station WFUV. For Record Store Day 2018, the band released another EP, entitled ""Crack Up (Choral Version)""/""In The Morning (Live in Switzerland)"", in collaboration with the Icelandic female choir, Graduale Nobili.

Shore (2019–present)
On December 31, 2018, Pecknold teased several new demos online for an upcoming new album.

Then the band made a demo and many gigs on their own with the little resources that they had; with all that, Zoé began to call the attention of the hispanic radio stations in the U.S. Later in 1998, Zoé signed a record deal with Sony Music Mexico and began making their first record in 2000; this album, self titled, came out and quickly became a favorite of the audience in Mexico; after that, the band performed songs in soundracks of movies such as 'Amar Te Duele', 'Ladies Night' and 'The Dreamer'.

Fast forward to 2003. Zoé, along with producer Phil Vinall (Placebo, Elastica, Pulp), recorded their second album called 'Rocanlover', which became more successful than the first one thanks to hit songs like 'Peace & Love' and 'Veneno', which aired in several TV countdowns.

In 2005, after three years of working together, Zoé left Sony Music because of the lack of real interest that this record label had in them and signed a new deal with Noiselab; with a newfound belief in record labels, Zoé made an EP called 'The Room', which debuted at the top of the rankings in Mexico. This EP includes, among others, the song 'Dead' (first single); also,are including ""She Comes"" and ""Morning Watts"" as new songs  and also some remixes of ""Dead"" by great electronic artists from Mexico such as Sonido Lasser Drakkar or Los Dynamite, plus a couple of videos.

On July 12th, 2006; Zoé (now wih Rodrigo Guardiola in the drums) presented their more recent production, ""Memo Rex Commander y el Corazón atómico de la Vía Láctea"", a sophisticate, layered production, which tops several magazines' rankings. Both Zoé and producer Phil Vinall worked very hard in Tornillo, Texas, a remote town in the desert, to get ""Memo Rex"" finished.

In fall 2006, Zoé headlined the Rockampeonato Tour, along with other Noiselab signees like Los Dynamite and Los Odio!, which held shows at cities like Mérida, Guadalajara and many others. This is the biggest tour Zoé has been a part of since they were formed.

In 2007 Zoé recorded ""281107"", a live album that celebrates their first 10 years as a band, it was recorded on the Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City, this recording went platinum pretty quickly which is something unusual for live recordings in Mexico. On November 11th 2008 ""Repileptric"" Zoé's seventh studio album was released.

79,lissom,119498,1157188,"Reconnecting with life after having seen and lived everything. Opening one's eyes again after trauma, loss, or a lost love. Lissom’s Eclipses brings to life these experiences. After a first eponymous record characterized by its romanticism and delicacy (2018, Whales Records), the duo composed of pianist, composer, and producer Julien Marchal and British songwriter and producer Lowswimmer (Ed Tullett) returns with Eclipses, a refined and poetic play of light. The two composers, separated by the sea and the past years’ confinements, worked remotely, exchanging their contributions via Ableton Live (a music creation software). This process brought a unique emotion and warmth to their masterful assets, imparting the feeling that the singer's falsetto and the Frenchman's minimalist piano longed to find each other and embrace. Separation anxiety impregnates the record: the loneliness that comes with it, but also the luminous hope of rebirth and the resumption of a former life. Here, the memory of the other is often painful, but also a source of comfort. Love betrays and hurts, but constitutes, by the trace it leaves and the promise it carries. ‘Eclipses’ is a more transparent and airy record than Lissom’s eponymous debut; simpler and perhaps even more moving. The presence of melancholy reveals a desolate but pure serenity that permeates all the tracks, just like Lowry's restrained distress.. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lissom"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

80,the knocks,647908,8260717,"The Knocks are a production and DJ duo who specialize in melodic, carefree dance music that draws from soul, funk, disco, rap, and pop. Making their name with several singles and remixes, as well as EPs like 2011's Magic, they made their full-length debut in 2016 with 55, which featured a diverse array of guests such as Cam'ron, Carly Rae Jepsen, Wyclef Jean, and Walk the Moon. Following side project diversions that delved into future funk (Amelia Airhorn) and tropical house (the Mary Nixons), the Knocks presented another feel-good disco-house throwback with 2019's New York Narcotic. The duo subsequently released projects with artists like Gallant, Rivers Cuomo, and Foster the People, with whom they recorded the covers-heavy 2021 EP Melody & Silence. The collaboration-heavy full-length outing HISTORY appeared the following year.

The Knocks were formed in 2008 by James ""JPatt"" Patterson and Ben ""DJ B-Roc"" Ruttner. Patterson and Ruttner met at New York City's New School and shared an apartment, where they set up small recording studios in their bedrooms. The loud noise coming from their apartment led to neighbors constantly knocking on their door in order to get them to pipe down, hence the duo's name. Early success as remixers, however, enabled them to build their own studio in Manhattan. During 2008 and 2009, Knocks remixes surfaced for Katy Perry (""I Kissed a Girl""), Britney Spears (""3""), and PRGz (""Soul Glo""). B-Roc and Andrew W.K. also released DAMN! The Mixtape Vol. 1 in 2009, featuring several Knocks productions.

In 2010, the Knocks released their first singles, the sunny ""Dancing with the DJ"" (which later appeared on their 2011 EP Magic) and the whistling ""Make It Better."" Over the course of the next few years, the duo's profile was magnified by additional remixes for Tegan and Sara (""Closer""), the 1975 (""Girls""), and Dragonette (""Let It Go""), among others, in addition to tours with Ellie Goulding, Dragonette, and Sleigh Bells. They also collaborated with Fred Falke for the Kitsuné Music release ""Geronimo"" in 2012, as well as Treasure Fingers for ""DYWT,"" released on Fool's Gold Clubhouse in 2014. Also in 2014, the group released an EP, titled Comfortable and released on the Neon Gold label, that included collaborations with X Ambassadors and Ra Ra Riot.

Signed to Big Beat, the Knocks slowed it down a bit for the 2014 single ""Classic,"" one of their funkier and more disco-indebted singles, featuring Powers. An EP titled So Classic appeared in April 2015, followed by a new version of ""Classic"" featuring a verse by Fetty Wap. The Knocks spent much of the year working on their long-delayed debut album, which was previewed by the singles ""I Wish (My Taylor Swift)"" (with Matthew Koma) and ""New York City"" (featuring Cam'ron). Finally, in March 2016, the duo released their first full-length, 55, which included additional guest appearances from Wyclef Jean, Walk the Moon, Carly Rae Jepsen, Alex Newell, and Semi-Precious Weapons' Justin Trantor. That July, the pair remixed selected tracks from the album on the 55.5 EP.

In early 2017, the Knocks released Testify, an EP of new songs featuring collaborations with MNEK, Delacey, and Tayla Parx. Later that year, the duo teamed up with Skylar Spence and released a future funk mixtape as Amelia Airhorn. They also formed the Mary Nixons, a group with Mat Zo, and issued the single ""Adrian."" They followed with the Captain Cuts collaboration ""House Party."" July 2018 saw the release of the single ""Shades"" which appeared later that year on the Knocks' second full-length, New York Narcotic. The album also featured contributions from Method Man, Sofi Tukker, and Foster the People.

2019 brought several singles, including the Kah-Lo collaboration ""Awa Ni"" and ""Lucky Me"" (with Great Good Fine Ok). Most of these were collected on the EP Summer Series: 2019. Several more singles arrived in 2020, including ""One Fine Day"" (with Idris Elba), ""Bodies"" (with MUNA), and ""All About You"" (featuring Foster the People). The following year, they released Melody & Silence, an EP with Foster the People that included a remix of the single, as well as covers of hits by Beck, Moby, and the Verve. Also in 2021, the Knocks released ""R U High"" (featuring Mallrat) and ""Sound the Alarm"" (featuring Rivers Cuomo and Royal & the Serpent), and were featured on Purple Disco Machine's ""Fireworks."" The following year saw the release of the full-length effort, HISTORY, which featured collaborations with Foster the People, MUNA, Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs, Cold War Kids, Parson James, and Yoke Lore, among others.

87,xavier rudd,513648,8500221,"Xavier Rudd (born 29 May 1978) is a soulful Australian singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist whose songs encompass themes such as spirituality, humanity, environmentalism and the rights of Indigenous Australians. He recorded as Xavier Rudd & Izintaba for the 2010 album ""Koonyum Sun"" and as Xavier Rudd & the United Nations for the 2017 album ""Nanna"". 

Growing up in a family of seven children in Torquay, Victoria (Australia), near the famous surfing location Bells Beach, Rudd showed a keen interest in music. While primary school-aged, Rudd used his mother's vacuum cleaner as a makeshift didgeridoo and he began playing his brother's guitar. He also played saxophone and clarinet as a child. 

Before launching his solo career, Rudd began playing music as part of the band 'Xavier and the Hum'. In 2004, Rudd released Solace, his first album to be distributed by a major label. 

Rudd's music is compassionate and always manages to render emotion in his fans. His songs include stories of the mistreatment of the indigenous people of his homeland; they tell of humanity, spirituality or the environment. The songs are written and sung with compassion and they urge the celebration of life.

Rudd is skilled with a variety of instruments, include guitar, shaker, didgeridoo, Weissenborn slide guitar, Tongue drum, stomp boxe, djembe, harmonica, ankle bells, and slide banjo. It's an experience to watch him perform his songs live, as he plays the guitar, digeridoo and various percussion instruments simultaneously, using a unique stage setup. But the real magic comes when he opens his mouth and his soulful voice spills upon his audience.

Rudd recalls that when he was 10, his dad took him to see Paul Simon’s Graceland tour. “I remember seeing it and knowing that that was what I was gonna do,” he says. “I had no doubt. It sort of made sense, because I’d always lived in my head, in this world of song that was my own little secret. But to see that show and that whole thing happening, I sort of felt comfortable as a human, and thought.”  He learned to play the digeridoo, the 50,000-year-old wooden trumpet of the Aboriginal people, by practising on a vacuum cleaner pipe. 

As a teenager, Rudd really got into songwriting. He started performing at his school, with solo gigs following.  He drew inspiration from artists such as Leo Kottke, Ben Harper, Natalie Merchant and multi-instrumentalist David Lindley, as well as music from diverse sources, such as Hawaii and Native American music.

As with most solo artists, Rudd has experimented playing in a band. Though it was a short- lived experiment, as Rudd quickly found that it wasn't the right way to go for him. “What I do now is just more me,” he says. “And it sounds full.”

Quotes:

“It’s all about peace and happiness,” he says of his performances. “That’s sort of the blanket that seems to sort of settle in the room, or on the venue when I play, but I sort of feel not solely responsible. I don’t really feel like it’s me and the audience. I feel like it’s all of us, one big connection and I just happen to be channeling the energy through music. It comes from the audience and channels through me and I put it back in the audience.”

“My music is about good spirit. I’m so lucky to be able to do what I do. I’m so blessed to be able to be able to travel around and play music and connect with so many people in so many places in so many cultures. It’s a gift of life as a musician.”

After the failure of his marriage in 2009, Rudd was supported in his grief and recovery by new South African bandmates, bassist Tio Moloantoa and percussionist Andile Nqubezelo. Rudd had met Moloantoa and Nqubezelo performing at the 2008 Wiesen Nuke Festival in Austria. Rudd described his connection with Moloantoa and Nqubezelo as musical, spiritual and emotional—""I feel like they were sent to me,"" he said.

In 2010 Rudd bought 20 hectares of property at Koonyum Range, Mullumbimby, the location was the inspiration for the name of the album Rudd would release with Moloantoa and Nqubezelo, titled ""Koonyum Sun"", as Xavier Rudd & Izintaba. The album moved away from the heavier sound of Rudd's 2008 album ""Dark Shades of Blue"" to a more up-beat style. 

""Nanna"", the 2015 album Rudd released as Xavier Rudd & the United Nations champions cultural understanding and condemns racism and intolerance. It features a diverse group of musicians from Australia, South Africa, Samoa, Germany, Ireland, and Papua New Guinea.  

In 2018, Rudd released ""Storm Boy"".  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Xavier+Rudd"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Alongside her solo career, she collaborated with prominent artists like Kleerup and Röyksopp, lending her vocals to the tracks ""Until We Bleed,"" ""Miss It So Much,"" and ""Were You Ever Wanted."" Her growing popularity led to notable appearances on shows like Conan and Skavlan in early 2011, helping her reach an even broader audience.

In 2016, Lykke Li co-founded the band LIV alongside members of Miike Snow and Peter Bjorn and John, further expanding her creative pursuits. Two years later, she released her fourth album, So Sad So Sexy (2018), marking a shift towards a more mainstream pop sound infused with late-2010s production influences. Her 2022 album, Eyeye, saw her return to a more introspective and sonically experimental approach, once again showcasing her characteristic blend of melancholic lyrics and innovative production. Over her career, Lykke Li has built a reputation for her sensuous, ethereal vocals and innovative musical style, solidifying her place as a significant figure in contemporary indie pop and electronic music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lykke+Li"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

 After graduating from Appalachian State University they moved to Asheville where they began writing their sophomore album.

The music has been called folk, nature-pop and baroque pop. But with two songwriters, one male and one female, and an organic approach to composition, the result is a sound they feel they can call their own.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/River+Whyless"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

97,khruangbin,893469,36236714,"Khruangbin (IPA: /ˈkɹʌŋbɪn/) is an American three-piece band from Houston, Texas, formed of Laura Lee on bass, Mark Speer on guitar, and Donald Johnson on drums. The trio's first single 'A Calf Born In Winter' was released in May 2014 by Late Night Tales offshoot Night Time Stories, and saw support from DJs Zane Lowe, Cerys Matthews, Tom Ravenscroft, Gideon Coe and magazines as musically diverse as Test Pressing, For Folks Sake, i-D, The 405 and Ransom Note. 'The Infamous Bill' is an expanded offering of Khruangbin's exotic, individual sound. The EP's four tracks were recorded at their spritual home, a remote barn deep in the Texas countryside where Khruangbin's first rehearsals took place. Taking influence from 1960's Thai funk - Khruangbin literally translates to ""Engine Fly"" in Thai - the EP is steeped in the bass heavy, psychedelic sound of their inspiration, Tarantino soundtracks and surf-rock cool.

Mark and DJ's roots are in R&B, hip hop and gospel having played within the same gospel band for years. Both professional musicians, Mark began teaching Laura how to play bass in the summer of 2009. As such, Laura quickly developed a huge passion for the instrument and the aesthetic it brought to music she loved. Having worked studiously on developing her skills, both Mark and Laura were invited to tour with Ninja Tune's YPPAH supporting Bonobo across his 2010 American tour. The tour galvanised the two of them to start making music together more seriously, sowing the first seeds of Khruangbin, with DJ the natural go to for drums. Having kept in touch, Bonobo included Khruangbin's 'A Calf Born In Winter' on his 2013 'Late Night Tales' compilation. In addition to increasing the Stateside following the band has built, the release has helped Khruangbin in topping both the US & UK 'Last FM' fastest growing artists whilst 'A Calf Born In Winter' continues to be one of the most popular single downloads from the compilation. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Khruangbin"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

99,arctic monkeys,6122742,723872910,"Arctic Monkeys is an alternative rock band formed in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England in 2002 after meeting at Stocksbridge High School. The band consists of Alex Turner (vocals, guitar, piano), Jamie Cook (guitar), Nick O'Malley (backing vocals, bass) and Matt Helders (drums, vocals). Founding bassist Andy Nicholson left in 2006.

The band has released seven studio albums: Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), Favourite Worst Nightmare (2007), Humbug (2009), Suck It and See (2011), AM (2013), Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018) and The Car (2022) (the first six of which debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart.

Each of the band's first five singles ""I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor"", ""When the Sun Goes Down"", ""Leave Before The Lights Come On"", ""Brianstorm"" and ""Fluorescent Adolescent"" hit the UK Top Five, but their sixth single, ""Teddy Picker"", only went Top 20 and their seventh single, ""Crying Lightning"" peaked at #12.

The band's rise to success started in late 2004/early 2005 when demo songs that had been handed out in CD form at gigs found their way onto the internet. These demos rapidly spread among message boards and friends leading to a growing fan base for the band, and were collected on the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk, which the band recognizes on their website.  The band owe much of their success to viral buzz via the Internet, and have eschewed typical 'commercial' channels, including refusing to appear on the UK's (now discontinued) Top Of The Pops music program, which was often seen as a gateway to success.

The band's debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, held the record for the largest first week sales of a debut album in the UK (in its first week, it sold more than the rest of the Top 20 albums combined). The album sold over 360,000 copies in its first week, but lost the title in November 2007 to Leona Lewis's album Spirit.

On 19th June 2006 the band officially announced that founding member and bassist Andy Nicholson had left the band after missing the American leg of their tour due to 'fatigue' and the other band members couldn't stand the constant 'missing his girlfriend syndrome' so they told him to sling his hook. Former Dodgems bassist Nick O'Malley was initially brought in as a stand-in, and played the band's remaining summer commitments. He was then announced as Nicholson's permanent replacement. 

The single ""Leave Before The Lights Come On"" came out on August 14th, but only reached Number 4 on the UK charts, denying the band a third consecutive number 1 single.

Their debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not won the 2006 Mercury Prize, was chosen as the best album of year 2006 by Q Magazine, and received a slew of other accolades.

Their second album Favourite Worst Nightmare was released on April 23rd 2007. It was preceded by ""Brianstorm"", the first single from the album, which was released a week before. Like its predecessor, ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"" sold more than the rest of the Top 20 combined, and - due to an error on iTunes - every song on the record appeared on the UK Top 200 Singles the next week.

When asked about Favourite Worst Nightmare Turner commented, ""We haven't changed that much. It's still about making contact with girls or not making contact with girls"".

The band began to write and record demos for the third album in January 2008, Turner said ""We had tunes that we'd already been playing on tour so we recorded them. That’s six [songs]. We’re going to take it easy and start practicing over the summer and doing new stuff.""

The band premiered new material from the unreleased album during their January 2009 tour of New Zealand, playing small venues in Wellington and Auckland ahead of the Big Day Out festival. Their first show in more than a year was on January 13, 2009 at Wellington's Town Hall. In both cities, the new songs played were ""Crying Lightning"", ""Go-Kart"", ""Dangerous Animals"" and ""Pretty Visitors."" The full setlist from the Auckland gig is available online. Also played was a cover of the Nick Cave song ""Red Right Hand."" During their last tour, the band had played new songs ""Put Me In A Terror Pocket"", ""Sandtrap,"" and ""The Fire and The Thud"" live.

Lead singer/songwriter Alex Turner started a two-man project with the singer from the Rascals, Miles Kane.
The band is called 'The Last Shadow Puppets'

The Arctic Monkeys band released their album Humbug in August of 2009, preceded by the single ""Crying Lightning""

They released their fourth studio album, Suck It And See, on June 6th, 2011.

They released their fifth studio album, AM, on September 9th, 2013.

They released their sixth studio album, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, with no preceding single releases, on May 11th, 2018.

They released their seventh studio album, The Car, on October 21st, 2022, preceded by the singles ""There'd Better Be a Mirrorball"", ""Body Paint"" and ""I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am"".

They made some show in US cities as ""a band out of time. One who faded away into obscurity after struggling to find success in the late 70's and early 80's. Only recently, the internet has begun to uncover the performances and recordings of a band that the world wasn't ready for.

1. TWICE (Korean: 트와이스; Japanese: トゥワイス)  is a nine-member South Korean girl group formed by JYP Entertainment through the 2015 reality show SIXTEEN. The group is composed of: Nayeon (나연), Jeongyeon (정연), Momo (모모), Sana (사나), Jihyo (지효), Mina (미나), Dahyun (다현), Chaeyoung (채영) and Tzuyu (쯔위). 

On February 11, 2015, Park Jin-young announced that the lineup of JYP Entertainment's upcoming seven-member girl group would be decided through SIXTEEN, a competition survival show that would air on Mnet later that year. The show began on May 5 and ended with Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung as the winners. Park then announced that he would be increasing the size of the group from seven members to nine by adding Tzuyu, who was the ""audience's pick"" since she was the most popular contestant by the show's end, and Momo, who was added by Park himself since he felt the group needed someone with her performance abilities. The decision was controversial at the time with many people complaining about eliminated contestants being able to join the group.

The group debuted on October 20, 2015 with the extended play The Story Begins and title track ""OOH-AHH하게"". TWICE rose to fame in 2016 with their single ""CHEER UP"" from their second mini Page Two; the song charted at number 1 on the Gaon Digital Chart and became the best-performing single of the year.

106,ajr,1023571,43595267,"AJR is a New York City-based indie pop band composed of brothers Adam, Jack, and Ryan Met (born Metzger). The band is a DIY pop group who write, produce, and mix their own material in the living room of their Chelsea apartment. Their music style has been described as ""eclectic"", combining elements of pop, barbershop, electronic, and dubstep music. They have opened for Demi Lovato, Hoodie Allen and the Wanted. In Summer 2014 the band went on tour with Lindsey Stirling.

There is no band, no song, no video, no sound, that is more “now” than AJR. The band — three brothers born and raised in New York City — has achieved a startling quick level of success with “I’m Ready,” a buoyant electro-pop single that’s taking off on social media. The numbers: over 1.5M views on YouTube, thousands of singles sold each week, features in Billboard, the NY Post, and on MTV. Festival performances in front of 10,000+ people.

AJR started to become popular with their track ""Weak"", which they wrote in a few hours and released 16th September 2016, that was made Platinum in 5 countries, including the US, and Gold in 4 more. It has more than 500 million Spotify streams.
They followed this up with their album The Click, released 9th June 2017, featuring the single Weak as well as ""Drama"" and ""Sober Up"", the latter of which features Rivers Cuomo. The album reached no. 1 on Mediabase's alternative singles chart the following year. An extended ""Deluxe"" version of the album was released 21st September 2018, including an acoustic version of Pretender, a track they worked on with Steve Aoki and Lil Yachty.

30th January 2019 saw the release of ""100 Bad Days"", which was performed on Jimmy Kimmel on 11th March (coinciding with the release of another single, ""Birthday Party""), and got included on Taylor Swift's ""Playlist by ME!"" in May of that year. Dear Winter was released 5th April, and got a sequel, Dear Winter 2.0, on 25th October.
Neotheater was their next album. It was debuted 26th April 2019 and was possibly where the band got noticed the most, hitting number one on Billboard's Top Rock and Top Alternative charts, and 8th on the Top 200 Albums. It featured 100 Bad Days, Birthday Party, and Dear Winter.

""Bang!"" came next on 13th February 2020, at first intended for a Deluxe version of Neotheater, but later integrated into their next album OK Orchestra. ""Bummerland"" was then released 31st August 2020. 22nd of December 2020 saw the release of My Play, 2 days after they announced OK Orchestra as an album. Then 17th February 2021 saw the release of ""Way Less Sad"".
OK Orchestra, often teased as OKO, was released 26th March 2021, featuring these 4 singles and a track with the Blue Man Group. Merchandise was release on the 23rd March, and a game called OKO World was released on the 21st. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/AJR"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

108,viagra boys,353001,13184564,"Generating a singular brand of noisy chaos, Swedish post-punk band Viagra Boys fuse pounding hard rock grooves, minimalist melodies, discordant guitar and sax, and howling vocals into an uncompromised volley of sound. Fascinated with drugs, anger, and the evils of male privilege, Viagra Boys became a cult phenomenon in their homeland before word spread throughout Europe, the United Kingdom, and North America about their punishing and articulate approach. After making their recording debut and setting their creative template with the 2016 EP Consistency of Energy, Viagra Boys both refined and sharpened their signature sound on their first full-length album, 2018's Street Worms. The album's strong critical reception helped bolster enthusiasm for their follow-up, Welfare Jazz, which appeared in early 2021.

Viagra Boys formed in 2015 in Stockholm, Sweden. Tattoo artists Henrik Höckert and Sebastian Murphy (the latter born in San Francisco but living in Stockholm) met through a mutual acquaintance and went out for a night of drinking. The two ended up at a karaoke bar, and after hearing Murphy belt out a unique version of Mariah Carey's ""We Belong Together,"" Höckert decided they needed to form a band. With Murphy on lead vocals and Höckert on bass, they recruited guitarist Benjamin Vallé, who had previously worked with Höckert in the group Nitad. With the addition of drummer Sol Tor Sjödén, the core of the group was complete and they began writing songs.

By the time Viagra Boys started playing out in June 2015, they'd added Oskar Karls on sax and producer Martin Ehrencrona on keyboards. By 2016, they decided it was time to document their music, and they cut a four-song EP, Consistency of Energy, issued by Kosmos Recordings. The Push My Buttons label brought out their second record, the 2017 EP Call of the Wild, but for their first full-length album, 2018's Street Worms, they signed with Year0001 Records, putting them on the same label as Swedish rapper Yung Lean. If the band was uncomfortable with the association, they didn't show it, and Street Worms got enthusiastic reviews while the tracks ""Sports"" and ""Just Like You"" earned enough streaming plays and video views to raise their following beyond the underground. Viagra Boys' unpredictable live show was documented on a 2019 concert recording, Shrimp Sessions, that was released only in Japan. In April 2020, Viagra Boys were back with their first studio recordings since Street Worms, a forceful four-song EP titled Common Sense. This was followed in January 2021 by Welfare Jazz, their chaotic and subversively satirical sophomore full-length. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Viagra+Boys"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

113,belle mt.,32192,174123,"Belle Mt. [spoken bell-mont] is a project conceived by songwriter and lead singer Matt Belmont during a period of withdrawal from public performances and releases between 2014 and 2016. During this time, he dedicated himself to introspective periods of songwriting development, beginning a musical and geographical journey as he wrote, co-wrote and produced. 
     The climax of this initial 2-year endeavor of expression and development saw him retreat to a friend's unfinished family holiday home to write in solitude at the foothills of the French alps. There Matt started experimenting with a new epic, cinematic sound mirroring his surroundings and the beautiful mountain views out of his makeshift studio window and beginning to build ethereal productions, developing the raw basis of a sound that would find its way into the hands of Nashville-based, Grammy award-winning producer Femke Weidema. As a former collaborator of prolific film composer Hans Zimmer, Femke's production reflects a deep knowledge of rich layering & the creation of dramatic soundscapes. 
     The sounds of the first EP could be summarized by deeply poetic lyrics and alt-pop melodies steeped in layered ambience and depth. Working out of home project studios on a shoestring budget, eight songs were written and demoed in that first 10-day trip, and the haunting lead-track ‘Hollow’ was born.
     Performing live as a 3-piece, the epic productions have been delivered to audiences on lineups, which range from British Summertime Hyde Park with Bruno Mars and Khalid to Popfest Dusseldorf with Macklemore and Clean Bandit. A combination of the powerful and intricate beats of Chris Burgess on drums/percussion and Ben Worsley’s swirling ethereal guitar sounds added to Belmont's emotive vocals, synth and acoustic guitar have been captivating audiences worldwide. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Belle+Mt."">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

118,beta radio,285840,2029039,"Beta Radio is an American band from Wilmington, North Carolina. The group consists of Benjamin Mabry and Brent Holloman. Stylistically, their music features an amalgam of folk, indie, chamber pop, rock and Americana influences.

Musically reminiscent at times of Bon Iver’s atmosphere heavy For Emma, Forever Ago or the Grateful Dead’s “Mountains of the Moon” from their 1969 release Aoxomoxoa, the sonic landscape of the band's album Seven Sisters is sparse but far from empty.  On tracks like “Khima,” “Borderline” and “Brother, Sister,” the slow scrawl of the banjo melody floats through the song and surrounds you like birdsong, coming at you predictably but surprisingly from several directions at once.  Each of the songs on this album stays with you, forming a soundtrack for and changing the shape of the rest of your day.

It’s appropriate that a debut album concern itself with creation and Seven Sisters is no exception.  Whether it is the creation of love and a place for that love, as the narrative of the album suggests; or the creation of the universe, as the album’s title and repetition of astronomical and astrological imagery suggests; Beta Radio’s lyrics and music carve out a space in your head and find a way to fit into your own cosmology.

Lyrically, Seven Sisters explores religion, albeit from a couch rather than a pulpit.  The religious allusions are subtle and unobtrusive, concerning themselves more with mysticism than proselytization, much like David Eugene Edwards’ 16 Horsepower and Wovenhand.

Line for line, the lyrics are beautiful and surprising.  In “A Place for Me” the lines “I wanted not to fight / With my heart but I’ll fight with my fists all night” evoke the heartache of leaving, of lovers’ spats of loss and regret.

The album leaves you with a simple but urgent lyric refrain in “Return to Darden Road”– “Where do you go? / Come back to me / ‘Cause I love you so.” Review by deckfight <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Beta+Radio"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

119,peach pit,877606,35077269,"There are at least 2 bands sharing the name Peach Pit.

1) Peach Pit are a pop band from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The band is led by singer and rhythm guitarist Neil Smith, lead guitarist Christopher Vanderkooy, bassist Peter Wilton, and drummer Mikey Pascuzzi. They describe their own music as ""chewed bubblegum pop"", whereas critics have described their sound as ""sad pop and surf rock"" and has a soft spoken vocal style with guitar driven rock melodies. The band's music videos are produced by videographer Lester Lyons-Hookham. The band have sported the same clothes for every live performance since buying them for their first music video shoot.

The group formed when high school friends, Neil Smith and Chris Vanderkooy, decided to collaborate on a musical project in 2014. Peter Wilton and Mikey Pascuzzi joined them on bass and drums. In June 2016, the band released its debut EP, Sweet FA, produced and recorded by Smith's former roommate Harley Small at The Space Studios in Vancouver BC. They quickly began work on their follow up release and debut LP, Being So Normal. The album was again recorded by Harley Small at The Space Studios  and was released in September 2017 on the Vancouver indie label Kingfisher Bluez.

Vocalist/rhythm guitarist Neil Smith was formerly part of the folk band Dogwood and Dahlia. Smith and bassist Peter Wilton formerly worked as Amazon delivery drivers, guitarist Christopher Vanderkooy worked at a local Vancouver brewery, and drummer Mikey Pascuzzi worked as a carpenter. The band quit their jobs to go on their first tour of North America, Europe and Asia from 2017-2018. They have been touring steadily ever since the release of their debut album.

Peach Pit performed at Bonnaroo, Shaky Knees Music Festival, CBC Music Festival, and Capital Hill Block Party in 2019 and opened for Two Door Cinema Club in a tour of the U.S. and Canada in 2019. The band has mentioned in interviews and during shows that they have recorded a new album.

2) Peach Pit is a 4-piece math/post rock band from Croatia formed in 1994.

The idea of making a band was started by Bruno Vidović and Mihael Bele in 1994, and after few parties, name Peach Pit (after an odd restaurant in the 90210) emerged as a name for a band that would create noise rock on the heritage of Big Black, Killdozer, Scratch acid and others. Peach Pit's first lineup was formed in the autumn of 1994 and it consisted of Mihael Bele on guitar, Bruno Vidović on drums and Branko Beðtak on bass.

First concerts which promoted early materials that featured vocals were loud and genuinely violent and often featured stage acts such as firecrackers, feedback and stage diving, for which they were often discarded as juvenile and abrupted by sound engineers by pulling out of electricity or even police.

By 1996, Peach Pit turned completely instrumental under influence of new music from across the water, and also played a lot of shows, some of them with noted names such as Zeni Geva. In the spring of 1997, Franjo Gluðac (previously from Liquid Light, also instrumental) joined Peach Pit on the second guitar, and his coming also marked departure of Beðtak which left Peach Pit as a three-piece with Franjo and Mihael on guitars and basses and Bruno on drums. Along with that, first compilation appearances were made, and Peach Pit was now open to audiences outside of Zagreb and started making materials for the first release.

Tricky Slaughter Operation cd-r (burned in 100 copies) was issued in the spring of 1998 and featured Tomica Ðãavina of Brassneck on bass (who left after the album was recorded and a short tour) and also Beðtak's guest appearance on one song. It was recorded live during a six month period in Kozmo. During that period Mihael and Franjo were also the guitar part of the Lunar with which Peach Pit shared a practice room.

Next self-release was Autom csep, which was mostly recorded by overdubbing in Kozmo in summer of 1998 and was issued along with Christmas greeting card ep which was recorded later that year. It was followed by a short concert break which was used for making of a first official album, Suspicios Cargo which was recorded in june of 1999 and was issued nine months later on Ivica Barièeviã's Earwing records. Bara also became promotor for most of the Peach Pit's concerts during that period.

Finishing of Suspicious cargo also marked Bruno Motik being recruited on second guitar, which created current lineup that exists since 1999. His coming brought complexity to songwriting and a step toward exploring new techniques which became our trademark since then.

In the summer of 2000, material for a second album (Music for the Fruitcake Generation) was recorded but was lost. That period was marked with heavy concerting which, along with a album material failure brought some problems to the band after which Peach Pit decided to take a one year break in 2001 after which a short European tour in 2003, that featured five-piece with Branko Beðtak(again) on bass, and Bruno Motik on second drums and guitar, took place. Also, Peach Pit also named a genre for the music which they are playing, sport-rock.

Later, in 2004 some of the songs from the lost material were re-recorded in Kozmo using live recording technique directly to tape and are to be released on Interstellar records Supernova 2 compilation. Four new Sport Rock songs have been recorded (26mins) in january 2006 in Kozmo, and are awaiting mix. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Peach+Pit"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

121,natalia lafourcade,640869,21022291,"María Natalia Lafourcade Silva (born 26 February 1984) is a Mexican pop and folk singer-songwriter who since her debut in 2003 has been one of the most successful singers in Latin America. Lafourcade's voice has been categorized as a lyric soprano.

Lafourcade was born in Mexico City, Mexico, surrounded by music and art. Her father is the Chilean musician Gastón Lafourcade who had French parents and her mother is the pianist María del Carmen Silva Contreras. Her uncle is the Chilean writer Enrique Lafourcade, a representative of the so-called ""Generation of the 50s"". She attended Instituto Anglo Español, a Catholic middle school, and studied painting, flute, theater, music, acting, piano, guitar, saxophone and singing. When she was 10, Natalia sang in a Mariachi group.

She grew up in Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico, where she studied music with her mother, María del Carmen Silva Contreras, imitating artists such as Gloria Trevi and Garibaldi. Her mother studied piano with a specialty in musical pedagogy and is the creator of the Macarsi Method for musical training and personal development for children and educators. She adapted and practiced the method with Natalia to help her rehabilitate through music following a head injury from being kicked by a horse.  

When she was 17, Loris Ceroni gave Lafourcade the opportunity to be in a pop/rock group under his guidance. Lafourcade was hesitant, and Ceroni instead encouraged her to become independent. Lafourcade produced her first LP under the label of Sony Music. It was recorded in Italy and was cowritten with Aureo Baqueiro. Sabo Romo played in 2 songs. Natalia Lafourcade is a mix of pop, rock, bossa-nova and Latin rhythms. It features the songs ""Busca Un Problema"", ""Elefantes"", ""Te Quiero Dar"", ""Mírame, Mírate"", and her biggest hit, ""En El 2000"". 

In 2005, she released Casa, her second album, but this time as Natalia y La Forquetina, the name of her band. Produced mostly by Café Tacuba's Emmanuel del Real, Casa presents a more mature, rock-oriented sound while retaining pop and bossa-nova influences on a few tracks, such as lead single ""Ser Humano"" (pop-rock) and its follow-up ""Casa"" (pop-bossa-nova). Aureo Baqueiro returned to produce the few tracks not produced by del Real.  More than a year after Natalia departed from La Forquetina, she recorded an instrumental album called The 4 Seasons of Love under Sony BMG label. She also wrote the Lyrics for ""Tú y Yo"" from Ximena Sariñana's self-titled album. 

In 2009, she released the album Hu Hu Hu, a top 10 album in Mexico. The album was produced by Emmanuel del Real (who produced ""Casa"" in 2005), Marco Moreno and Ernesto García. It was nominated for Best female Pop Vocal Album at the 2009 Latin Grammy Awards (won by Laura Pausini) and Best Latin Pop album at the 2010 Grammy Awards (won by La Quinta Estación). Club Fonograma also named the album the second best of 2009, and the seventh best of the decade.

In 2012, she released a tribute album to Agustín Lara called Mujer Divina.

Her next album, Hasta La Raíz, was released in March 2015. ""Nunca Es Suficiente"" (It's Never Enough), the first single off the album, was released on 10 February. The track ""Hasta La Raíz"" was No. 5 of the Viral 50 Global Spotify Chart and the No. 1 on the Viral 50 México chart.

In 2017, she recorded ""Remember Me"" as a duet with contemporary R&B singer Miguel for the credits of the movie Coco, and together they also performed the song at the 90th Academy Awards ceremony.

2020 saw her release the eponymous Un Canto por México, Vol. 1.

131,annenmaykantereit,397321,11243739,"AnnenMayKantereit is a three-piece band that hails from Cologne, Germany. The group, which takes its name from the surnames of its founding members Annen, May, and Kantereit, initially formed in 2011 while the members were still attending Schiller-Gymnasium school in Sülz. 

The band started performing on the streets of Cologne, with videos of their performances garnering a following on social media. During one of their practice sessions, they eventually welcomed double bass player Lars Lötgering into the fold. 

In 2013, AnnenMayKantereit released its first self-recorded album, which was celebrated with a launch party in Cologne's Gebäude 9 venue. They continued to gain traction with German audiences, performing at various festivals and supporting big names such as Clueso and the Beatsteaks.

The band's signing with Universal Records in 2015 led to recording an EP titled ""Wird schon irgendwie gehen"" at Hansa-Studios in Berlin. Following this, AnnenMayKantereit embarked on sell-out tours and continued to solidify its place in the German music scene.

AnnenMayKantereit has released several albums throughout their career. In 2013, they released their first self-recorded album, which had a release party in Cologne.

After releasing the music video for their song ""Wohin du gehst,"" the band toured Germany.

132,cocoon,272175,4527884,"There are at least six bands called Cocoon:

1. Cocoon is a two-piece French band formed in 2006 by Mark Daumail (born 1984, composition, lead vocals, acoustic guitar, ukelele, banjo, beatbox, etc.) and Morgane Imbeaud (born 1987, vocal harmonies, keyboards, arrangements).

""I wanted it to be a male-female duet. A duo like the White Stripes are in rock — we wanted to be the equivalent in folk music,"" Daumail says. Their songs are entirely sung in English. ""French artists singing in English isn't something new. It goes back to groups like Les Thugs and Syd Matters,"" he remarks.

Daumail says he's always been interested in folk music: ""Basically, Cocoon's musical inspiration goes all the way from groups like The Pentangle and Fairport Convention right through to the 'new folk' movement that surfaced around the beginning of 2000 with artists like CocoRosie, Devendra Banhart and Sufjan Stevens.""

In 2006, the pop / folk duet released its first EP, entitled I Hate Birds, and won the 2006 edition of the Big Jama regional contest. The following year, Cocoon was signed onto the French indie label Sober & Gentle. The band released a second EP, From Panda Mountains, followed by their first album, entitled My Friends All Died in a Plane Crash. The group won the CQFD music contest organized by the French magazine Les Inrockuptibles and performed in the new talent section of the rock music festivals Le Printemps de Bourges and Les Eurockéennes de Belfort.

2. Cocoon is a solo project by one of the founding members of the French group Clair Obscur which was one of the first groups in the 80's in France to work across music, visual arts, dance and theatre. Clair Obscur was one of the very few bands of the French cold wave/industrial scene which became known abroad with its records released by the British labels Cathexis, All the Madmen and NER (compilation From Torture to Conscience with Current 93, In the Nursery, Death in June, etc). 

Christophe Demarthe has been working for many years at the frontier of sound and visual arts. He has created sound architectures for theatre, dance, cinema, visual arts, radio... mainly working with the drama producer Bruno Lajara (501 Blues, Ne Pas, Fuites, Après Coups, Léon le Nul...) and with Jean Couturier for radio dramas on France Culture. He has written music for the cinema and for television (France 2, Canal Plus). 

In 2004 he created Cocoon, releasing his debut album on the French label Optical Sound. Much more than a mere sound object based on an album concept, Cocoon can be read as a global artistic project close to the performance. It is an audio set accompanied by videos and asking for an active participation of the public, banishing the passive listening of laptoppers. The stage disposition creates a real contrast with the characteristic immobility of electronic music concerts, and definitively places itself at the crossing point of image, sound and live show, for a moving interdisciplinarity. 

Since its creation in 2004, Cocoon has participated in the festivals Nowa Fabryka (Bytom, Poland), Emergences/Villette Numérique (Paris), Nuit Blanche (Paris), Emo-Son (Bourges), Salon Light (Paris)... He has been reviewed in Libération, on Arte-TV.com, in the magazines Mouvement, Télérama, The Wire, on France Culture... His second album, More Violent Days Are to Come (OS.012) (Optical Sound), has been nominated for the Qwartz Electronic Music Awards 2006/2007.

135,yumi zouma,365386,6664616,"Yumi Zouma are a New Zealand alternative pop band from Christchurch, Canterbury. The band consists of Christie Simpson (vocals, keyboards), Josh Burgess (guitar, bass guitar, vocals, keyboards), Charlie Ryder (guitar, bass guitar, keyboards), and Olivia Campion (drums). The band's name is an amalgamation of the two friends that encouraged the group to start writing together.

The group's origins trace back to their history of playing concerts together in Christchurch. However, the band did not begin writing music together until multiple members moved abroad and began collaborating over email following the events of the Christchurch earthquake. This early material gained attention within the musical blogosphere and encouraged American label Cascine to sign the band before they had played live or held a band practice.

Between 2014 and 2015, the group released two EPs (EP I, EP II). The band's debut album Yoncalla was released in 2016, including the singles ""Keep It Close To Me"" and ""Barricade (Matter Of Fact)"". In 2017, the band released their second album, Willowbank, and the singles ""December"", ""Depths (Pt. I)"", and ""Half Hour"". EP III was released in 2018, including the singles ""In Camera"" and ""Crush (It's Late Just Stay)"". In 2020, the band signed to labels Polyvinyl Record Co. and Inertia Music, and released their third album Truth or Consequences, which featured the singles ""Right Track / Wrong Man"", ""Cool For A Second"", ""Southwark"", ""Lonely After"", and ""Sage"".

Founded by Burgess, Ryder, and vocalist Kim Pflaum, the group began writing music using file-sharing services when Burgess left New Zealand to work at New York-based record label Captured Tracks. The band's first release, EP I, debuted in early 2014, after the single A Long Walk Home For Parted Lovers appeared on several blogs before being quickly taken down. The band was positively reviewed by Pitchfork and profiled by The Guardian, leading to the group signing with Brooklyn-based record label Cascine. In mid-2014, the band began playing live, touring with singer Lorde, and collaborating with other acts, such as the Swedish band Air France. Guitarist Sam Perry[ and vocalist Christie Simpson joined the group in 2015, while Pflaum left and started the solo project Madeira (later renamed Laumė). The band released a second EP, EP II, in early 2015, and proceeded to tour extensively throughout Europe, Asia, and North America, with the likes of Jamie xx and Lower Dens.

The band quickly released their first full-length album, Yoncalla, the following year. As opposed to the long-distance writing of the band's earlier releases, Yoncalla consisted of material that had been finished during tours for EP II. The majority of the album's final material was recorded in Paris, France, following an American tour that stopped by the city of Yoncalla, Oregon. The band produced the album at electronic musician Philippe Zdar's Motorbass studio in Paris, enabling them to achieve a sound more akin to classic synth-pop than their previous records.

After a year of heavy touring in support of Yoncalla, the band traveled home to record in New Zealand for the first time. A limited edition cover of the Oasis album (What's The Story) Morning Glory? was distributed on vinyl in early 2017, before the release of the band's second album, Willowbank, in October. The sessions for Willowbank marked the first time that the group had worked together in a professional studio, with the band initially questioning whether they should ""all move into separate rooms"" to recreate the remote songwriting process from previous records. However, the sessions allowed for stronger collaboration and more organic instrumentation compared to earlier material, leading to jazz musician Olivia Campion joining the band as a live drummer. The lead single ""Depths (Pt. I)"" became a success on streaming platforms, and was accompanied by a video created by illustrator Frances Haszard. Following the completion of touring for Willowbank, Perry left the band in order to concentrate on his Serbia-based musical project DOG Power.

In wake of the departure of Perry, the remaining four members of the band proceeded to return to the methods of long-distance writing that had inspired their earlier material. This process led to the creation of a third EP, released in October 2018. A video for the lead single ""In Camera"" was released in early 2019, directed by Pavel Brenner. A video for the second single ""Crush (It's Late, Just Stay)"" was also released in 2019, directed by Robbie Barnett.

After signing to Polyvinyl and Inertia Records, Yumi Zouma released their third studio album Truth or Consequences on March 13, 2020. The album features the singles ""Right Track / Wrong Man"", ""Cool For A Second"", ""Southwark"", ""Lonely After"", and ""Sage"". Along with the album, Yumi Zouma is set to release a unique line of merchandise which includes a candle, bandana, and enamel pin.

Celestin rose to prominence after releasing a series of mixtapes, remixes, and original music projects beginning in 2010 under the alias Kaytradamus. By 2013, and under the moniker Kaytranada, he began gaining wider recognition and, the following year, signed a deal with XL Recordings, with whom he released his debut studio album, 99.9%, in 2016. In 2019, he released its follow-up, Bubba, for which he won two Grammy Awards including Best Dance/Electronic Album. Celestin is one half of the hip hop duo The Celestics, along with his brother Lou Phelps. 

Kaytranada arrived during the early 2010s with ear-perking remixes and an array of sounds that veered from J Dilla-inspired hip-hop beats to distinctly woozy house grooves. Numerous commissioned works and short-form solo releases led to his debut album, 99.9%—which went on to win the 2016 Polaris Music Prize and the 2017 Juno Award for Electronic Album of the Year. After signing to major-label RCA, the Haitian-Canadian released his second album, Bubba.

139,car seat headrest,1117063,128336058,"Car Seat Headrest is an American indie rock band formed in Leesburg, Virginia, and currently located in Seattle, Washington. The band consists of Will Toledo (vocals, guitar, piano, and synthesizers), Ethan Ives (guitar, bass, backing vocals), Seth Dalby (bass), and Andrew Katz (drums, percussion).

Beginning as a solo recording project by Toledo in 2010, Car Seat Headrest self-released 12 albums on the music platform Bandcamp, before signing to Matador Records in 2015. Car Seat Headrest would begin touring as a full band the following year.

History
2010–2014: Lo-fi and solo releases, from 1 to How to Leave Town
Car Seat Headrest began as the solo project of singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Will Toledo (born William Barnes) shortly after he graduated high school. Toledo had previously released music under the alias Nervous Young Men, but after struggling to establish an audience, he decided to change tactics, choosing to try and release more experimental songs anonymously. Toledo chose the name ""Car Seat Headrest"" as he would often record the vocals to his early albums in the back seat of his car for privacy.

Throughout the summer of 2010, Toledo released his first four albums under the Car Seat Headrest name: 1, 2, 3, and 4. 1 and 2 incorporated less traditional song structures, with stream-of-consciousness lyrics, whereas 3 and 4 would begin to cement his lo-fi indie rock style. Following the numbered albums, Toledo began attending classes at Virginia Commonwealth University, releasing the Sunburned Shirts EP during his first semester. The Sunburned Shirts EP would later be partially combined with his fifth LP, 5, to create his first titled album, My Back Is Killing Me Baby, released in March 2011. Songs culled from 5 would later appear on the b-sides compilation album Little Pieces of Paper with ""No"" Written on Them.

After a difficult and lonely semester at VCU, Toledo transferred to the College of William & Mary, where he would release his next project, Twin Fantasy, a concept album centered on a relationship he was in at the time. Twin Fantasy would later be followed up by 2012's Monomania and Starving While Living EP.

Around this time, Toledo began performing live shows with fellow students Katie Wood, Austin Ruhf, and Christian Northover, recording and releasing a short live album in July 2013 entitled Live at WCWM: Car Seat Headrest at the university's studio. Toledo would release his next project the following month; a two-hour long double album entitled Nervous Young Man. Three of the songs, and the title of the album, were taken from his original project, Nervous Young Men, but had been heavily reworked and re-recorded. Released alongside Nervous Young Man, for those who paid $5 or more, was the outtakes compilation album Disjecta Membra.

Toledo's final solo release was 2014's How to Leave Town, an hour long EP with heavy electronic instrumentation and more ambitious song structures.

2015–2017: Matador Records, Teens of Style and Teens of Denial
Ethan Ives.
In September 2015, Car Seat Headrest announced on Facebook that he had signed an album deal with Matador Records. Toledo, who had recently graduated and moved to Seattle, recruited bassist Jacob Bloom and drummer Andrew Katz through Craigslist to record and tour his next album. In October 2015, Car Seat Headrest released the compilation album Teens of Style, their first to not be self-released exclusively via Bandcamp. Shortly after the album's release, Bloom left the group to attend medical school, and was replaced by bassist Ethan Ives.

Ives played bass throughout most of the recordings for the band's following release, but would later switch to guitar and other instruments, with Seth Dalby taking over on bass. Ives and Dalby were later cemented in these positions during live shows and future releases. The new album, created with traditional studio processes, Teens of Denial, was released on May 20, 2016. The album received universal acclaim, and brought the band a new wave of popularity.

In 2017, Car Seat Headrest released an alternate mix of their single, ""War Is Coming (If You Want It)"" through Bandcamp for one day, with profits going to the Transgender Law Center. The original mix of the track was released ten days later.

On December 13, 2017, the band released a re-recorded version of ""Beach Life-In-Death"", the second track on Twin Fantasy, through Spotify without prior announcement. This sparked fan rumors that the album would be re-recorded and released the following year. On December 27, 2017, an Amazon listing detailing a re-recorded version of Twin Fantasy was found by fans, and subsequently uploaded to the Car Seat Headrest subreddit. This was followed up by a listing on SRCVinyl.com with the date February 16, 2018. 

2018–2019: Twin Fantasy (Face to Face) and Commit Yourself Completely
On January 9, 2018, Matador Records formally announced the release of the re-recording, entitled Twin Fantasy (Face to Face), alongside a re-release of the original album. Twin Fantasy (Face to Face) was released via Matador on February 16. The original, which has been re-titled Twin Fantasy (Mirror to Mirror), was released on vinyl as a part of Record Store Day on April 21. On February 15, 2018, the band released a cover of ""Fallen Horses"" by Smash Mouth, who returned the favor by covering ""Something Soon"". Around the same time, they began touring with fellow Seattle-based band, Naked Giants, as a part of the group's expanded live lineup.

In August 2018, when asked about new material, Toledo confirmed that he was “demoing out stuff in Ableton,” adding “there might be some stuff that surprises people who only know us as a rock band, but I don’t think it will come as a surprise to people who are checking out all the deep cuts.” In January 2019, Andrew Katz confirmed the band was recording new music through a video uploaded on Instagram.

Following the tease of new music, the band began experimenting with new material at various live shows in December 2018, debuting the tracks ""Weightlifters"", ""Hollywood"", ""Stop Lying To Me"", and ""You Know There's Someone Out There"", soon followed by ""Can't Cool Me Down"" in February and March 2019 performances. All were officially released on the next album except for ""Stop Lying To Me"" and ""You Know There's Someone Out There"".

On June 12, 2019, Car Seat Headrest announced a new live album titled Commit Yourself Completely, featuring official recordings of performances from the Twin Fantasy tour from 2018. It was released the following week on June 17.

2020–present: Making a Door Less Open
On February 26, 2020, Car Seat Headrest announced their first studio album consisting of wholly new material since 2016's Teens of Denial, Making a Door Less Open. This announcement coincided with the release of ""Can't Cool Me Down"", the first single and second track off the album, and a release date of May 1, 2020. It marks a stylistic divergence from previous material, Toledo describing the album as containing elements of EDM, hip hop, futurism, doo-wop, soul and rock and roll. Three more singles were released to promote the album between March and April of that year: ""Martin"", ""Hollywood"" and ""There Must Be More Than Blood"". The release also coincided with the introduction of Trait, an alternative persona of Toledo's, featured prominently wearing a modified gas mask with blinking LED lights for eyes. The character had originally been created for the group's ""comedic"" side project, 1 Trait Danger, featuring Toledo alongside drummer Andrew Katz.

Making a Door Less Open was released with three separate versions across different formats: vinyl, CD and streaming, each with variations in track-list and specific musical elements. The album received a mixed reaction from fans, which pointed out the many divergences from the band's previous works, but received an overall score of 77 on review aggregate site Metacritic. Toledo noted that he and the band were working on a companion album for their latest release, while also looking for ways to improve the Trait mask to incorporate it into live performances.

Style
AllMusic biographer Mark Deming wrote that Car Seat Headrest created ""moody and introspective lo-fi pop tunes that are melodic but structurally ambitious at once."" Writing for Pitchfork, Jeremy Gordon stated that on Teens of Denial, ""Will Toledo reaffirms that he is ahead of the pack as an imaginative singer-songwriter, capable of crafting dynamic indie rock."" Ian Cohen of Pitchfork also described Toledo's music as ""dense, confounding music that most often captures the giddy thrill of having access to recording equipment, of finally put a sound to the voice in your head.""

Car Seat Headrest's influences include Radiohead, Pink Floyd, the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Daniel Johnston, Destroyer, Kendrick Lamar, Frank Ocean, Leonard Cohen, of Montreal, Modest Mouse, Neutral Milk Hotel, Sufjan Stevens, Swans, They Might Be Giants, Why?, R.E.M., the Who, Nirvana, the Blackout, Neil Diamond, William Onyeabor, the Clash, the Cars, James Brown, DEVO, Queen, Rod Stewart, and Green Day. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Car+Seat+Headrest"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

142,tyler childers,448199,25514889,"Tyler Childers (born June 21, 1991) is an American singer and songwriter. His music is a mix of country, bluegrass and folk. He released his breakthrough album Purgatory in August 2017. Childers released his third and most recent LP, Country Squire, via his own Hickman Holler Records, under exclusive license to RCA Records in August 2019. 

Tyler Childers was born and raised in Lawrence County, Kentucky. His father worked in the coal industry and his mother is a nurse. He learned singing in church where he sang in the church choir. He started to play guitar and write songs when he was around 13. He moved from Lawrence County to Paintsville, Kentucky, where he attended Paintsville High School and graduated in 2009. Fellow country musicians Chris Stapleton and Loretta Lynn (Van Lear, KY) also hail from Paintsville. He studied for a semester at Western Kentucky University, and enrolled at Bluegrass Community and Technical College for a few semesters. He dropped out of college and did odd jobs for some time while pursuing a music career.

Childers began performing in Lexington, Kentucky and Huntington, West Virginia. In 2011, when he was 19, Childers released his first album, Bottles And Bibles. He has also released two EPs recorded in 2013 at Red Barn Radio, a radio show from Lexington. The two EPs were later released as one after the success of his album Purgatory, and reached No. 5 on Heatseekers Albums.

He had his first success with Purgatory, a breakthrough album released on August 4, 2017. The album was produced by Sturgill Simpson and David Ferguson and recorded at The Butcher Shoppe in Nashville. Simpson also played guitar and sang backing vocals on the album, with Miles Miller on drums, Stuart Duncan on fiddle and Russ Paul on other instruments. It debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums chart, No. 17 on the Country albums chart and No. 4 on the Americana/Folk albums chart. In September 2018, Childers won Emerging Artist of the Year at the 2018 Americana Music Honors & Awards, where he gave an acceptance speech noted for its criticism of the Americana genre label, saying that ""as a man who identifies as a country music singer, I feel Americana ain't no part of nothing and is a distraction from the issues that we're facing on a bigger level as country music singers. It kind of feels like purgatory.""

Country Squire, a second album under the Hickman Holler label, and Childers' third overall, was released on August 2, 2019, after being announced in May 2019. This album was again produced by Simpson and Ferguson. The video of the lead single from the album ""House Fire"" was also released on May 16, 2019.

Childers' music is influenced by his home state of Kentucky and its connection to country music and bluegrass. He often writes about coal mining, which was his father's occupation, and its effects. Rebecca Bengal, writing for The Guardian, described Childers' songs as a ""counternarrative to the outsiders who seek to perpetuate stereotypes of backwardness and poverty."" Childers emphasizes lyrical content in songs, comparing the songwriting process to telling short stories. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tyler+Childers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In May 2020, Parks released the singles Eugene and Black Dog, which were well received during the COVID-19 lockdown, the latter of which became BBC Radio 1's Tune of the Week.

In the time since their formation, flipturn has mushroomed to reaches far beyond the walls of the Fernandina Beach garage they first practiced in.

With over 60 million streams on Spotify alone, countless sold-out headline shows across the US, and tours with Mt.

Career
Within a year of formation, Beach House charmed indie music enthusiasts across the blogosphere with their languid songcraft, while the eerie warmth of ""Apple Orchard"" landed on Pitchfork's Infinite Mixtape MP3 series in August 2006. Two months later, they issued their eponymous debut album for Carpark. Fall shows with labelmates Over the Atlantic were also scheduled. Victoria can also be heard on Frenemies' Birds in High School album.  She and Chris Freeland created harmonies on the song ""Waiting for the Ambulance"". Victoria can also be heard on Grizzly Bear's 2009 release Veckatimest and she sings on ""Slow Life"", a Grizzly Bear track featured on the official soundtrack for Twilight: New Moon.

In September of 2009, Sub Pop Records announced that Beach House had signed and that a follow up album to 2008's Devotion, Teen Dream, would be released in early 2010. The album received universal acclaim from contemporary music critics, additionally hailed as one of the best albums of 2010. Their fourth studio album, Bloom, was released on May 15, 2012, as their second release with Sub Pop. Released to further acclaim from music critics, it was supported by the lead single ""Myth"", with the album debuting at number seven on the US Billboard 200 album chart.

Following the success of Bloom, Beach House began recording their fifth album, Depression Cherry (2015), in November 2014.  Earlier that year, the group contributed to Lefse Records' compliation album The Space Project, with the track  Saturn Song. Recording for Depression Cherry ended in January 2015, with the album's lead single ""Sparks"" being released at the beginning of July 2015. Depression Cherry was released on August 28, 2015, and debuted at number eight on the US Billboard 200 album chart. Two months after its release, the group announced that they would release their sixth studio album, Thank Your Lucky Stars (2015), later that same year, adding that it is ""not a companion to Depression Cherry, or a surprise, or b-sides"".

After releasing those two albums in 2015, Beach House announced that a compilation album, B-Sides and Rarities (2017), would be released in 2017 as a way of ""cleaning out the closet"" to pave the way for a new creative process. It was released on June 30, 2017, containing two unreleased tracks and other ""rare"" tracks. The next year, the band announced their seventh studio album, 7 (2018) and released four singles to promote it; ""Lemon Glow"", ""Dive"", ""Dark Spring"" and ""Black Car"". 7 was released on May 11, 2018, and was co-produced by Sonic Boom (alias of Peter Kember), singer and guitarist of Spacemen 3. It received universal acclaim by music critics, who praised the adventurous nature of the album and the consistency of the band, with some considering it the group's best album to date.

In April 2023, the band released the EP Become (2023), which contains five tracks that were recorded in the sessions of Once Twice Melody, in which the band described as ""(not fitting) in the world of (Once Twice Melody), but... a little world of their own"".

160,cocteau twins,1831819,118178673,"Cocteau Twins were a Scottish band active from 1979 to 1997. They were formed in Grangemouth by Robin Guthrie (guitars, drum machine) and Will Heggie (bass), adding Elizabeth Fraser (vocals) in 1981 and replacing Heggie with multi-instrumentalist Simon Raymonde in 1983. The group earned critical praise for their ethereal, effects-laden sound and the soprano vocals of Fraser, whose lyrics often eschew any recognisable language. They pioneered the 1980s alternative rock subgenre of dream pop.

The band's early work drew influence from Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division. After signing with the British record label 4AD in 1982, they released their debut album Garlands later that year. The addition of Raymonde in 1983 solidified their final lineup, which produced their biggest hit in the UK, ""Pearly-Dewdrops' Drops"", peaking at No. 29 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1988, Cocteau Twins signed with Capitol Records in the United States, distributing their fifth album, Blue Bell Knoll, through a major label in the country. After the 1990 release of their most critically acclaimed album, Heaven or Las Vegas, the band left 4AD for Fontana Records, where they released their final two albums.

After nearly 20 years together, the band disbanded in 1997 in part due to issues stemming from the disintegration of Fraser and Guthrie's romantic relationship. In 2005, the band announced that they would reunite to headline Coachella and embark on a world tour but the reunion was cancelled a month later after Fraser refused to perform on stage with Guthrie. In a 2021 interview, Raymonde confirmed that Cocteau Twins ""will never reform"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cocteau+Twins"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

161,bilk,94453,927855,"There are at least three bands named Bilk:

1. an indie/punk band from Essex, U.K. (début: 2018)
2. a band from Zagreb, Croatia
3. a 'neo-Neue Deutsche Welle' band from Berlin, Germany

1. The raw and real sounds of the trio Bilk (from Essex, United Kingdom) sets new standard for guitar music in England with a unique blend of indie, rap and punk. First singles (2018): 'Give Up' and 'Spiked'.

2. BILK were formed in Zagreb, Croatia in 1999. The line-up was unstable for years, until it got reduced to the steady and dedicated base: Tin Oberman, Janko Novoselic, Luka Vrbanic are young students of architecture, music and medicine and they use their crafts and gifts fully, building their sound with surgery precision.

With people joining and leaving the band, BILK went through many phases and music styles and this experience broadened their musical horizons. They recorded a few demos, played many shows and appeared on some music competitions like the Heineken Music Fest Live (2003) in Travnik and Zenica, BIH where they simply came and won and the Newcomer 2005 festival in Graz, Austria where they also made first prize.

Soon thereafter Mr. Moonlee proposed them a record deal. BILK went to the legendary Kozmo Studio in Zagreb and recorded their debut album called This Bilk is Radioactive which was released by Moonlee Records with Marko Pelaic as producer.

Their heuristic approach enabled them to produce a brilliant album featuring a sound unheard in this area before. The groove, coming out of their drums, bass, synthesizers and guitar is built from various music styles melted into a breakbeat mass of pure positive energy, melodies and beats.

3. Bilk from Berlin, Germany, find themselves in a triangle between punk, rock and pop, where a little influence of the 80th century music, especially the Neue Deutsche Welle' (NDW), which can't (and won't) be denied and they consider with a critical view what is important in the world: life, love and the passion with wich things can be done and unfairness wich cannot be overlooked.

They present their knowledge in a wide range from loud and rough to harmonic and pensive in their native tongue without falling into the trap of presenting trash or phrasemongering. Their language is straight and cheeky - probably mostly because of their ""Berliner Schnauze"" (cheeky way of speaking in Berlin). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bilk"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2)  Heroes of the modern garage revival, the Wombats were born sometime in the late 70s, somewhere in the leafy lanes of Maple Heights, Ohio. Teenage guitar strangler John Zinrich, a.k.a. Johnny Fettish (so called because he had a thing for biting women's knees under tables, hence ""John Knee Fetish""), had previously lived out the punk ideal by dropping out of high school at age 15 to join Public Enemy, noted in Cle 3.0 for doing ""the fastest version ever attempted of 'I Wanna Be Your Dog'."" Striving for a poppier sound, Fettish and his suburban neighbor Vic Halm penned a series of power-punk pop gems and entered the first national ""Battle of the Garages"" competition run by Bomp/Voxx honcho Greg Shaw. The 'Bats contributed a track, ""The Reason Why"" to the first ""Battle"" compilation and played on the national ""Battle"" tour in 1981. Positive public reaction won them a recording contract, and between 1981 and 1984 the 'Bats released two singles and an album, ""Zontar Must Die!"" on Bomp/Voxx. They also played various notable East Coast and local venues, including the first WRUW Studio Arama show and the opening night of the Lakefront (which displayed ""Wombats"" on its curb sign for several years as a result). Their energetic live show was notable for speedy fuzzy guitars pumped through Marshall stacks, unintelligible vocals, and the sight of 5'4"" Fettish leaping two feet in the air, against a backdrop of six-foot-tall John Lennon-lookalike Halm and equally towering bassist Tim Ratley. In 1984 the Wombats played a show with the seminal Columbus band Great Plains, who brought them to the attention of Gerard Cosloy at Homestead Records. The Wombats subsequently recorded one EP for Homestead, ""Mudpuddles"", which came out in 1985. Unfortunately, the band had a falling out with Cosloy over their inability to tour, since drummer Tommy Edwards was busy studying to be a refrigerator repairman. As a result, promotion for ""Mudpuddles"" was almost nil and the 'Bats found themselves once again without a label. In 1986, Fettish and Halm wrote and recorded some excellent demos for a third album which they hoped to place on a major label, but due to lack of interest this project never saw the light of day. Since then, the 'Bats have played sporadically around Cleveland with various lineups. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Wombats"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

166,the warning,146106,6034173,"There are multiple artists tracked on this page. 

1) The Warning are a rock band originating from Monterrey, Mexico. The band was formed in 2013 by the Villarreal Vélez sisters: Daniela (guitar, lead and backing vocals, piano), Paulina (drums, lead and backing vocals, piano), and Alejandra (bass guitar, piano, backing vocals). They have released four studio albums, two EPs, and eight music videos. Their latest studio album, Keep Me Fed, was released on June 28th, 2024.

The Villarreal Vélez sisters were raised in Monterrey, and all received training on various instruments at an early age. At some point in their childhood, Daniela and Paulina had selected guitar and drums as their primary instruments, respectively. When the youngest of the three, Alejandra, selected bass guitar as her primary instrument at about age 7, the sisters decided to form a rock power trio in 2013. They learned to play rock songs, often via the Rock Band video game series, and posted videos of their performances on YouTube.

In 2014, 12-year-old Paulina was profiled in the women's drumming publication Tom Tom Magazine. The band first gained widespread notice later in 2014 when, at ages 9 through 14, their YouTube video in which they performed Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"" went viral among rock music fans, eventually earning more than 20 million views. The video received attention from Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett, who offered particular praise for Paulina, saying, ""The drummer kicks maximum ass!""

Due to notice gained from their ""Enter Sandman"" video, The Warning decided to seek a record deal and develop their songs. They raised money through a successful GoFundMe appeal to record the six-song EP Escape the Mind, which was released in 2015. During the production of the EP, the band met producer Jake Carmona, who went on to contribute to Escape the Mind and their next three albums. In April 2015, the band appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. During this period the sisters raised funds, including a donation from DeGeneres and the Target Corporation, to attend a five-week training program at Berklee College of Music in the United States.

They also gave two presentations at the TEDx conference at the University of Nevada in 2016 and 2017.[17][18] The band was known for practicing with the Rock Band video game series early in their history; designers returned the favor by including several songs by The Warning in the 2018 edition of the series.[19][20]

The Warning's first full-length album, XXI Century Blood, was released in 2017. During this period they were invited to perform at the Mother of All Rock Festival in Monterrey and also opened a show for The Killers in that city. Their second album Queen of the Murder Scene was released in November 2018. They announced an extensive upcoming tour throughout North America in late 2019, though it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In August 2020, The Warning signed a five-album deal with Lava Records, and began work on a new album with producer David Bendeth. The song ""Choke"" was released in May 2021. Later that year, The Warning appeared on the Metallica tribute album The Metallica Blacklist, performing another cover of ""Enter Sandman"", this time with singer Alessia Cara. The six-song EP Mayday was released in October 2021, and The Warning embarked on a tour of North America in early 2022, performing more than 30 dates as headliners plus opening for Foo Fighters, Sammy Hagar and the Circle, and Stone Temple Pilots. They released the single ""Money"" in March 2022, and the song reached no. 31 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Airplay chart. The full-length album Error, comprising the six tracks from the Mayday EP plus ""Money"" and seven new songs, was released in June 2022. In July 2022, they embarked on a U.S. tour supporting Halestorm and The Pretty Reckless and appearing at festivals like Burlington's Sound of Music Festival, Iceberg Alley, Summerfest, and Upheaval, before resuming their headlining tour in August 2022. In the Fall of 2022, The Warning performed at additional festivals (Louder Than Life, Aftershock, Peninsula Tecate, Rock al Parque), supported a second US tour with Halestorm, a Canada tour with Three Days Grace, a Guns N' Roses tour stop in their home city of Monterrey, Mexico, and performed small-venue concerts in Las Vegas, California, and Lima, Peru. The band supported Muse during several dates on the Will of the People World Tour in both Mexico and Europe. In September 2023, they opened for Guns N' Roses again on two dates of the We're F'N' Back! Tour. In early 2024, the band announced on social media that their fourth studio album Keep Me Fed will be released in June 2024. In March 2024 three new singles from the upcoming album were released: ""S!CK"", ""Hell You Call a Dream"" and ""Que Mas Quieres"".

168,it lives,727,5312,"It Lives plays powermetal/speedmetal  with a slight taste of thrashmetal and heavymetal. 
Their biggest musical influences are Overkill, Annihilator, Megadeth, Testament, Running Wild and Savatage.

The band plays their music with a 'wink'. This means that they want to play their songs as good as possible, but they need some humour. So don't expect them to look like 'evil' people standing still, quietly playing music on stage.
The band-members are having fun in making metal and thy try to make a party of every gig. This is their main ingredient for a good gig, maybe that's why they already have some big fans...

It Lives disbanded in 2006

170,vendredi sur mer,363287,5269997,"From Geneva, Switzerland, although her nationality is usually defined as Franco-Swiss. Her name is Charline Mignot, but artistically she is known as Vendredi sur Mer.

Coming into the world in the mid 90's, Charline grows up with a very introverted view of the world around her. As she grew up and wanted to explain her surroundings in her own way, she moved more and more towards the arts, fashion and photography, and it is in the latter that she dedicated her studies.

In his quest to make his own mark and push his own boundaries within the aesthetics he used for his photographs, he eventually started writing songs. The first time was with the idea of using self-made music for her photo shoots, knowing that music would help set the mood within the shoot. That's how her first song, ""Est-ce que tu t'en souviens"", was created.

Their style is quite distinctive, having been described as dream-pop, electro-pop, electro-ambient and even ""space-disco"". The marriage of Charline's art and direction caught the attention of Swiss and French producers, including Lewis Ofman, who produced her most listened-to single, ""La femme á la peau bleue"", in 2016, a song that became famous in the fashion world as the official music for one of Sonia Rykiel's 2017 collections.

Mignot's voice is always soft, as if she were singing from a reverie. She uses a spoken voice in all her songs, which come across best as storytelling about women, sensuality, love and heartbreak. In some interviews she has expressed frustration at being associated with radical feminism just because her music is about women, ""as if it's something abnormal or radicalised for a woman to write about women instead of men"", so she often says that she goes between one gender and the other, to create confusion among listeners.

Vendredi sur Mer's first EP came out in 2017 and is called ""Marée basse"", the only studio album she has released to date is called ""Premiers émois"" and was released in 2019 with the single ""Chewing-Gum"".

Do you like women who make music independently and maintain a beautiful aesthetic to match their creations and their music videos?

Despite their frequent comparisons to riot grrrl bands like Bikini Kill, the members of the band deny any associations with it, saying that they love the genre, but they shouldn't be categorized as it just because they're female-fronted.[33]

174,unknown mortal orchestra,1035226,30830339,"Unknown Mortal Orchestra (UMO) is a New Zealand psychedelic rock band formed in Auckland and currently based in Portland, Oregon, USA. Primarily composed of singer, guitarist, and songwriter Ruban Nielson, and bassist Jacob Portrait, the band was started by Nielson in 2010. The band's debut album was released in 2011 on Fat Possum Records. In November 2013, the band's second album, II, won Best Alternative Album at the New Zealand Music Awards. 

In late 2010 the band's bandcamp account featured their single ‘Ffunny Ffrends’, a sort of alien beatnik pop music that echoed 60s psychedelia and krautrock minimalism with just a hint of gentle weirdness that suggested its roots might equally lie in the verdant indie of the equally distant New Zealand scene.

Ruban Nielson is a New Zealand native who transplanted to Portland, Oregon, USA with his band The Mint Chicks. UMO was a project conceived as Ruban’s escape hatch to a new musical dimension where his vision of junkshop record collector pop could be realised in a sound that recalled Captain Beefheart, Sly Stone and RZA jamming on some kids TV theme too dark to ever be broadcast.

The eponymous UMO debut album was released in 2011 on Fat Possum Records, followed by II (2013), Multi-Love (2015), Sex & Food (2018), IC-01 Hanoi (2018) and V (2023). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Unknown+Mortal+Orchestra"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His music also caught the attention of songwriters such as Dan Wilson known for his work with Adele, Scott Harris, Carrie Underwood, among others. Kahan deferred his admission to Tulane University to pursue his developing music career. Kahan has said that two career goals he wished for were to be verified on Instagram and to have a Wikipedia page.

Kahan cites some of his inspirations as Paul Simon, Cat Stevens, Counting Crows, Hozier, and Mumford and Sons.

In 2016, Kahan signed to Republic Records and he began working with producer Joel Little, known for his work with Lorde and Khalid, with whom he recorded six songs. Kahan released his first single ""Young Blood"" in January 2017 and gained over 9 million streams.

""Cape Elizabeth"" was then released on May 1, 2020.

On June 17, 2021 Kahan announced his second full-length album titled ""I Was/I Am"". Five days later he announced the ""I Was/I Am"" tour. On September 17, 2021, the album was released. Throughout the summer leading up to the release of the album Kahan released “Part of Me”, “Godlight”, and “Animal” as singles ahead of the album drop. “Part of Me” was the only one of the three singles to be dropped before the album announcement.

Over the following two years, the song became a fan favorite, further growing in popularity on social media app TikTok. Kahan followed it up with the release of ""Northern Attitude"" on September 16.

On October 14, 2022, Kahan released his album Stick Season. According to early reviews of the album from AP News, ""There’s irony there because these feel like songs both longtime listeners and newer fans will want to belt back to Kahan — not because they’re produced for stadiums or arenas, but because they’re full of nostalgic melodies that will resonate far beyond New England."" Kahan wrote this album during the pandemic which he spent back home in Vermont. Stick Season leans more into the folk genre than the rest of his older music which were more pop sounding. Kahan says that in his album, Stick Season, he wanted to pay homage to the folk singers that he grew up listening to. He adds that his greatest goal as a songwriter is to write music that other people can relate to and to be able to throw that lifeline to someone.

On March 17, 2023, Kahan was featured on Joy Oladokun's single ""We're All Gonna Die"", which was also released as part of her April 2023 album, Proof of Life.

On June 9, 2023, Kahan released a deluxe version of Stick Season titled, Stick Season (We'll All Be Here Forever), which includes seven previously unreleased tracks. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Noah+Kahan"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

179,villagers,603515,9815858,"Villagers are an Irish band from Dublin fronted by Conor J. O'Brien.
They have performed at several music festivals and toured with Tracy Chapman, Bell X1 and Tindersticks. They have one EP, titled Hollow Kind (2009). Their debut album Becoming a Jackal was released in 2010 and was shortlisted for that year's Mercury Prize and their second album {Awayland} was released in 2013.

Conor O'Brien formed Villagers after the break-up of his previous band The Immediate. The very next day, O'Brien wrote the first song after waking up with a hangover. O'Brien's time as a guitarist in Cathy Davey's band was also critical to the development of his style as he had never before performed alongside anyone outside of The Immediate. Villagers gave their first live performance as a support act with The Chapters at a show in Whelan's in November 2008. At that point the band had previously only rehearsed together on two occasions. They had only seven songs, written by O'Brien and passed on to the rest of the band to learn.

Villagers performed on the seventh series of RTÉ Two's Other Voices television programme in 2009. The band's debut EP, titled Hollow Kind, was released in February 2009. It contained four tracks, all of which were written by O'Brien and performed by him too. The EP brought comparisons with Bright Eyes and Sparklehorse. Villagers then went on tour. They were a support act for Neil Young and toured across Europe with Tracy Chapman.

Villagers appeared at several festivals in 2009. They supported Bell X1 when they performed at Live at the Marquee in Cork on June 26, 2009. They performed at several music festivals in Ireland, including on the Sunday of Oxegen 2009, at Indie-pendence on August 2 and at Electric Picnic 2009, as well as at Latitude Festival in the UK. The Irish Times's Jim Carroll recommended their performance in the Body Soul Arena at Electric Picnic 2009 as ""A must-see for those who dig ragged pop, eerie folk and heartfelt, emotional songs and sounds"". They headlined Hard Working Class Heroes in 2009, with O'Brien attracting the ire of the audience when he requested some quiet during the performance. They gave a live performance at The Music Show in Dublin's RDS in October 2009.

The debut single of Villagers was ""On a Sunlit Stage"" and was released in October 2009.
On January 15, 2010, Villagers represented Ireland at the Eurosonic Festival in Groningen, the Netherlands. They were involved in efforts to raise funds in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. They embarked on a tour with Tindersticks in March 2010 and released the single ""Becoming a Jackal"" on April 17, 2010. A debut album Becoming a Jackal was released in Ireland on 14 May 2010, with a UK release in May and a US release due on 8 June 2010. The album immediately went to number one on both the Irish Albums Chart and the Irish Indie Albums Chart. It proceeded to continuously top the indie chart.

Said by Conor J. O’Brien himself: 
- “Ultimately, I’ve learned that a song is not an isolated thing. You have to wash the dishes before you write a song. It should never be taken too seriously. It must be treated with joy and humour, regardless of the subject matter,” muses Conor, as he strokes his hairless chin.
- “The aim is to feel the songs out. If I don’t surprise myself, then it is a worthless endeavour. Indeed, I would apply this attitude to all aspects of this project. The songs are quite decisive, but I have no idea what I am doing, or where I am going.” Again, he strokes his chin, this time with a look of resigned confusion. “Once the songs took shape, I asked some friends of mine to help me play them to people. When they kindly agreed, I decided that we would present ourselves as ‘Villagers’ – I don’t really know why. I think I like the name because it doesn’t offend the songs.” With this, he puts his clothes back on and bids me farewell. On returning to my office, I slip on a banana peel and subsequently die. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Villagers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

181,baynk,319613,4194001,"Pushing beyond his playlist origins, the New Zealand producer’s debut album revels in eccentric details while adhering to traditional pop structures. Like so many electronic artists in the mid-’10s, New Zealand’s BAYNK (Jock Nowell-Usticke) got his start making chill, pop-adjacent songs that seemed primed for placement in mood-based playlists. His early attempts at surf-bro EDM sounded like what Kygo and LeMarquis were putting out on SoundCloud at the time; he used his voice sparingly, mainly as material to be sampled. In the years since, though, he has refined his palette. On 2017’s Someone’s EP I and 2019’s Someone’s EP II, his percussion took on the rhythmic impulse of Four Tet, and his rubbery basslines and glossy experimentalism were reminiscent of early Cashmere Cat and Flume. Using his Auto-Tuned falsetto to further texturize his songs, BAYNK’s fusion of house, R&B, and pop soon set him apart from the many similar acts scattered throughout the scene.

Adolescence is BAYNK’s most meticulous work to date. It revels in eccentric, distinctive details while adhering to traditional pop structures. Most arrangements consist of grainy synth loops, plucky subs, and house-inspired drums; his digital sounds are drenched in reverb and slapped with sidechain. On the Cosmo’s Midnight-assisted “How Does it Feel?” languid synth pulses and a funky bassline give way to some of the sharpest vocal melodies on the album. “Remember,” which features Rainsford, exhibits BAYNK’s talent for peeling a heavily layered song back to its component parts before climaxing into an ecstatic yet graceful drop. This is dance music for headphones, club music for late-night walks.

The best songs on Adolescence bend toward straightforward pop formulas and, tellingly, include non-electronic instruments. “Mine” is led by quiet piano and spacey guitar, while standout “Naked” blends acoustic elements and electric bass with shimmering synths. BAYNK gives his best vocal performances here: “Get caught up on trying to pin you down/Your fingers ’round my neck, they’re feeling soft now,"" he coos on “Naked,” evoking the warm upper register of Whitney’s Julien Ehrlich. He’s not a great singer, as Tinashe makes plain when she steals the show on “Esther”; he scrubs clean his imperfections with layers of automation, delay, and reverb. Still, BAYNK has a keen ear for melody and knows his limits, wisely ceding the mic to guests while he works the boards.

The album is nominally a concept record about the immediacy of youth and romantic first experiences. “I went through this period of not being able to write anything,” BAYNK told Apple Music. Being in a “stable and happy relationship” wasn’t conducive to inspiration, so to get around his writer’s block, he returned to the creative cocoon of “first love.” Lyrically, the album is imagistic and vague, depicting half-baked scenes of lying in the sun, holding hands in a car, and walking through fields. The narrative never coalesces into anything meaningful, and its emotional pull wanes quickly. First love invigorates but rarely sustains; it’s BAYNK’s elastic and original production that propels the album forward, the pulse of the beat begging us to feel something beyond recognition. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/BAYNK"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

182,ben mazué,76171,1297713,"Ben Mazue was born to a French teacher and an architect. He entered the music conservatory to study piano. Throughout his childhood, he and his parents lived in Biot and moved to the capital, Paris, in the following years. As a teenager, he decided to stay and settle in Paris while his parents returned to the south of France to Biot.

In addition to his piano studies, he also took courses in medicine. At the end of his various studies, he decided to take up music at the age of 25. In love with the knowledge of rap and soul music, he started to compose and to multiply his experiences as well as his friendships.

With his friend Augustin, Ben Mazue performed for a while as a duo in the bars of the capital and then went on to form a group called La Plage for at least three years. This is how he got the taste for performing on the city's stages and did not stop touring at the first opportunity.

Ben Mazue: an artist with a successful career
Ben Mazué won the Prix de la Découverte de la Sacem at the Festival Jacques Brel de Vesoul 2006. He also won the Paris Young Talent Award in June 2008 and the FAIR in 2010. He then performed a series of shows as the opening act for Anis, Tété and Hocus Pocus. Ben Mazué has also given numerous concerts on his own, notably at the Printemps de Bourges and Francofolies festivals.

He has released several albums, including Common Ground, his first 5-track album, released in 2007. Then, at the end of 2010, he released his second album with the help of guitarists Clément Simounet, Régis Ceccarelli and Jean-Pierre Sluys. Ben Mazué has also signed a contract with Columbia Label, a subsidiary of Sony Music. His first album was released in October 2011.

He released his track Confession, from his rap albums, Addicts and Mes Monuments as a single. The third single from the album, ""C'est Léger"", is sung with singer Pauline Croze. Ben Mazué has had several tours in France. In 2020, he released Paradis, his fourth album, which recounts the summary of his life in the wake of his separation.

Indeed, it is an album that also refers to the island of Reunion, which he affectionately calls his Paradise on Earth. Finally, during the years 2020 and 2021, he becomes with his song Quand je marche, the winner of the Charles Cros prize, one of the high school students of the ACC.

Discover Ben Mazue's news and what he is up to in 2022
Since the release of his excellent album Paradis, Ben Mazué's reputation has grown in a matter of weeks. Most of those who know him since then, as well as those who have just discovered him, are waiting to see his next concert. In terms of current events, the artist is preparing a concert for his public by June, certainly in the fall of 2022.

In the spring season of 2022, that is to say on 23 March, the Zenith will be visited and more precisely in Rennes. The city of Lille is not on the sidelines and will be hosting Ben Mazue on 30 March. The city of Rouen will follow suit by hosting the artist on 04 April. The renowned artist Ben Mazué will arrive in Nantes on 05 April, in Paris on 8 April and will finish in Lyon on 13 April 2022.

So, if you want to see Ben Mazue in concert near you, you have all the chances on your side. You can check out all the dates listed above and book your tickets. Recently, the artist made a video in Reunion Island where he tells in a very special way how his songs became successful.

What is Ben Mazue's style of music?
Ben Mazue is without doubt the surprise of the contemporary rap world. This young man from Biot was not destined to be a rapper. However, it was when he arrived in Paris with his parents that he discovered it. It is through this style of music that he tries to drown his feelings on paper that he accompanies with rap music. His music has been influenced by the famous Alain Souchon, Renaud and Jacques Brel.

The essence of his music comes from rap, but also from African music and American soul. These different influences place him at the crossroads between grand slam, rap, soul music and reggae. In 2011, Ben Mazué made his name on the scene with his first album. It is an autobiographical album that raises awareness and shows that taking care of oneself means taking care of others.

Over the years, the artist has made a name for himself through his art and his desire to impact the world through his melodies. As a result, rapper Ben Mazué has become one of the icons of rap music in Europe and even worldwide.

185,cat power,2048076,75082026,"Cat Power is American singer, songwriter, musician, occasional actress, and model. Charlyn Marie Marshall (also known as Chan, pronounced ""Shawn"")  was born in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. on 21 January 1972. Cat Power was originally the name of Marshall's first band, but has become her stage name as a solo artist.

After dropping out of high school, Marshall started performing under the name Cat Power, while in Atlanta, backed by musicians Glen Thrasher, Mark Moore, and others. She soon moved to New York City, New York, United States in 1992, then later opening for Liz Phair in 1994, she met Steve Shelley of Sonic Youth and Tim Foljahn of Two Dollar Guitar, who encouraged her to record, and played on her first two albums, 1995's Dear Sir and 1996's Myra Lee. In 1996 she was signed to Matador Records, and released her third album, What Would the Community Think, which spawned a single and music video, ""Nude as the News"".

Shortly following the release of What Would the Community Think Marshall disappeared from the musical scene, initially working as a baby sitter in Portland, Oregon and then moving to a farmhouse in Prosperity, South Carolina with boyfriend Bill Callahan (who performs under the name Smog). The plan was to permanently retire from music but during a sleepless night resulting from a nightmare, Marshall wrote several new songs. These songs would make up the bulk of Moon Pix. The album was recorded at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne in eleven days with backing musicians Mick Turner and Jim White of the Dirty Three. The album was well-received by critics, and gained her recognition in the indie rock scene. However, during the subsequent tours she grew tired of her own material. This resulted in a series of shows during 1999 involving Marshall providing musical accompaniment to a series of screenings of the silent movie The Passion of Joan of Arc. The shows combined original material and many covers, many of which would later see release on The Covers Record, a collection of cover songs recorded at various sessions in 1998 and 1999. A selection of covers that didn't make it on to the album were recorded at Peel Acres, home of the highly influential and legendary British DJ John Peel. The session was broadcast on his BBC Radio 1 show and featured Marshall's own interpretations of Bob Dylan's ""Hard Times in New York Town"" amongst others.

In 2003 she resumed releasing original material with You Are Free, a diverse and critically acclaimed album that featured guest musicians such as Eddie Vedder, Dave Grohl, and the Dirty Three's Warren Ellis.

2004 saw the release of Speaking for Trees, a critically polarizing DVD which featured a single two-hour static shot of Marshall performing in a woodland. It was accompanied by an audio CD containing the 18-minute song ""Willie Deadwilder"", which featured M. Ward on guitar. 2005 found Cat Power out on the road again, touring the world and playing sold-out solo shows, including an Australian tour supporting Nick Cave. The shows largely consisted of material for her next album.

Cat Power's seventh record, The Greatest, was released in January, 2006. This was not a ""Greatest Hits"" record but rather a collaboration with Al Green's guitarist Teenie Hodges and many other well-known R&B musicians. A tour followed in the fall of 2006.

Early in 2006, Marshall announced the cancellation of her upcoming United States tour, citing ""health-related issues"". A few days later, Matador announced the cancellation of her two shows in London and Paris. She resumed touring in April 2006, playing some of the most well received shows of her career both with the Memphis Rhythm Band and as a solo performer. 

In 2007, she played live music for the spring/ summer Chanel Haute Couture collection in Paris and appeared in Wong Kar Wai's film My Blueberry Nights as Katya. Also in 2007, she became the first female ever to win the Shortlist Music Prize when The Greatest was voted album of the year in June. Earlier in the year she was nominated in the Best International Female category at the annual Brit Awards, alongside more mainstream artists like Christina Aguilera and Nelly Furtado. 

On January 22, 2008, Cat Power released a second collection of covers called Jukebox--her eighth LP overall. It included versions of songs by artists such as Hank Williams, James Brown, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Patsy Cline and Janis Joplin.

Since then, she has released an EP called ""The Dark End of the Street"" on vinyl, only.

Cat Power released her first original song since 2008 just before Christmas 2011 when an MP3 of ""King Rides By"" was made available on her official site, in exchange for a donation of at least $0.99 to the Festival of Children Foundation and the Ali Forney Center charities. (King Rides By Songfacts). 

In 2012, Cat Power released her 9th studio album,  Sun  which received generally positive reviews from critics. The album was included in several year-end lists by music critics and publications. Rolling Stone magazine, in their list of the ""50 Best Albums of 2012"", ranked it at sixteenth place, writing ""the idea of the brilliantly morose Chan Marshall making a dance-rock record is almost absurd. Yet the groove-powered Sun is a perfect fit."" The A.V. Club placed the album at number twenty-two on their list of the ""Best Albums of 2012."" Billboard also placed the album at number nine in their list of the ""10 Best Albums of 2012.""The L.A. Times and Filter magazine both placed the album at number six in their lists of the best albums of 2012. Sun was also included on two separate ""Best Music of 2012"" lists compiled by NPR, appearing at number five on the list compiled by Bob Boilen,while topping the list compiled by Robin Hilton. The album was also listed twenty-eighth on Stereogum's list of top 50 albums of 2012. Thus, becoming Cat Power's most successful original album. 

In April 2015, Marshall announced that she recently had a baby.

In February 2016, Marshall had to cancel her New Zealand shows due to health reasons. According to an official press release, this is the first time in Marshall's 18-year touring history she has been forced to postpone, but is ""determined to make it back ASAP, and in good health"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cat+Power"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

186,mother mother,1550673,77190292,"Mother Mother is an indie rock band which formed in Quadra Island, British Columbia, Canada in 2005. The band consists of Ryan Guldemond (vocals, guitar), Molly Guldemond (vocals, keyboards), Jasmin Parkin (keyboards, vocals), Jeremy Page (bass) and Ali Saidat (drums). So far they have released ten albums: Touch Up (2007), O My Heart (2008), Eureka (2011), The Sticks (2012), Very Good Bad Thing (2015),  No Culture (2017), Dance And Cry (2018), Inside (2021), Grief Chapter (2024), and their latest album, DEMMOS (2024), released recently on November 14th, 2024.

The band began in Vancouver in January 2005, when guitarist and vocalist Ryan Guldemond was at music school and wanted to start a band based around vocal-driven pop songs. He recruited his sister Molly along with a friend from college, Debra-Jean Creelman, to accompany his own vocals for the songs he had written, and the trio played as an acoustic act before adding drummer Kenton Loewen and bassist Jeremy Page.

The five members started off playing under the name Mother, and in the fall of 2005, they independently released a self-titled album. This debut album was recorded with Howard Redekopp, who had also worked with The New Pornographers and Tegan and Sara. When the Vancouver Province rated Mother as one of the top five BC bands to watch for in 2007, they began to receive acclaim for their debut album. Shortly thereafter, Mother landed a nationally broadcasted concert opening for K'naan and The Wailin' Jennys. In the summer of 2006, they opened for the Australian band, The Cat Empire, at the sold-out Vancouver International Jazz Festival. Later that year, they made their debut in central Canada at the Montreal International Jazz Festival on June 29 as well as in Toronto on July 1, Canada Day, at the Harbourfront Centre.

In October 2006, after playing a set at the Pop Montreal festival, Mother met with Last Gang Records and later signed a four-album contract. At that point the label encouraged the band to change their name to avoid legal issues, so rather than changing it completely they decided to simply rename themselves Mother Mother. On February 20, 2007, the band re-released its debut album under the new name, renaming the album Touch Up and including two new songs, as well as artwork and overdubs different from the original.

The band released their second album, O My Heart, in 2008. In December 3, it was announced that Debra-Jean Creelman had left Mother Mother, with the addition of a new singer/keyboardist, Jasmin Parkin, announced in January 2009.

Mother Mother's third album, Eureka, was released on March 15, 2011. The album's lead single, ""The Stand,"" entered the Canada Singles Top 100 chart in May 2011 and peaked during that week at position 76. The album prompted a reviewer at the Toronto Star to describe the band as ""evolving into orchestral harmonies and hip hop-influenced power ballads, as if Adam Lambert had joined The Dirty Projectors."" On January 9, 2012, Kraft Foods launched a series of television commercials featuring the song ""Bright Idea.""

Mother Mother's fourth album, The Sticks, was released on September 18, 2012. It contains 14 tracks and was co-produced by band frontman Ryan Guldemond and producer Ben Kaplan. The first single, ""Let's Fall in Love"", was released on July 17, and the second single, ""Bit By Bit"" in December.

In 2014 the band signed with Universal Music Canada to produce their fifth album, Very Good Bad Thing, which was released on November 4, 2014. The first single from the album, ""Get Out The Way"" was released on July 15, 2014.

Mother Mother has since produced two more albums under Universal Music Canada. In February 2017 ""No Culture"" was released, with the first single ""The Drugs"" released November 4, 2016, and the second single ""Love Stuck"" released November 29. 

In November 2018, ""Dance and Cry"" was released, the only single ""Get Up"" released on September 14.

In  June 2021, "" Inside""  was released, this was the first album to feature a remastered song with their popular single from O My Heart ""Hayloft"" getting a remaster in the form of ""Hayloft II""

After a short break from 2022-2023, Mother Mother released two albums. The first of which being  ""Grief Chapter, and the second being ""DEMMOS."" Grief Chapter was announced in November of 2023 and was released the following few months on February 16th, 2024. DEMMOS was the tenth and most recent album released by Mother Mother on November 15th, 2024. It was not announced beforehand and was a silent release, and is the first and only album by Mother Mother to feature demos of currently existing songs. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mother+Mother"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The remaining five “losers”, including Simm, then formed the band Liberty X.

Since then, he has created his own Myspace music profile, uploading demo tracks for his fans to hear his progress as a solo artist. In a March 2008 interview with Gordon McCully, he stated, “I’ve been very busy in the studio recording new solo tracks which I’ll hopefully be able to share with people very soon.” Simm has signed to JamDown Music, which his track “Brand New” is featured on their official website’s music player.

Being discouraged from watching TV as a child was integral to the development of Fenne Lily's musicality, as instead much of her time was spent writing songs and honing both instrumental and understatement in equal measures.

At the age of 17 she began travelling to Bristol from her home in Dorset, and within a year found herself suporting the likes of Marika Hackman, Marlon Williams, KT Tunstall, C Duncan, and Palace, among many more. Soon after she self-released her debut single 'Top to Toe' - a song she had written when she was only 15 - which aling with her next two singles amassed over 20 million streams in the next 18 months.

A prolific artist, she soon found herself collaborating with a number of other musicians, including Aldous Harding and fellow Bristolians Tamu Massif & Oliver Wilde.

Throughout this whole time however, she has been writing for her own songs. Enlisting some musical friends to join her and recording with one foot on the Isle of Wight and one in Bristol, Fenne completed her debut album due in 2018.

Juana, who was living in Bolivia at the time, met again with Fefo during the summer of 2012, and in March of that same year they played the first stages, adding Ricardo Boretta (drums) to their performances. Shortly afterwards, Dario Bercovich (clarinet), Joaquin Gutiérrez Calviño (accordion), and finally Pablo Viru Tirachio (guitar, banjo, charango) joined them.

On stage they dress equally, in suit and tie, far from being a formalism, but rather a manifesto.

193,lagum,285322,16682441,"Lagum is a Brazilian pop and reggae band formed in 2014 in the city of Brumadinho, Minas Gerais. It is composed by Pedro Calais, Otavio Cardoso, Jorge, Francisco Jardim and formerly Tio Wilson.

It all started in 2014, in the city of Belo Horizonte, when Pedro Calais decided to post a video of one of his compositions on Facebook; a friend who was the promoter of events at a concert hall saw him and encouraged him to form a band to perform at the venue. Therefore, Calais decided to call his childhood friends Otavio Cardoso, Glauco Borges, Francisco Jardim and Breno Braga. The group started their career performing at this concert hall in the city, playing their own songs, which are credited to all of the band.

In May 2016, the quintet released their debut studio album titled Seja o Que Eu Querer. In February 2018, an acoustic version of the song ""Deixa"" was released in partnership with singer Ana Gabriela. The song, in this version, became a success, being among the most played in the country, giving visibility to the group to participate in television programs and sign a contract with the Sony record company. In June 2019, they released their second studio album named Things of the Generation.


On September 12, 2020, the band would perform two shows in drive-in format in the city of Nova Lima, Minas Gerais. However, drummer Tio Wilson (Breno Braga) had an indisposition in the interval between the two performances and died from a cardiorespiratory arrest. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lagum"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

194,the filthy souls,10253,45890,"The Filthy Souls, young, indie-rockers out of Manchester, England, possess a creative maturity beyond their youthful experience and it’s that maturity that drives their music and performance. Their strength of voice transcends any era classification, while still giving just a wink toward their own musical influences. Their obvious appeal to U.S. audiences comes from, as the Sunday Telegraph Australia calls it, the mix of “a bit of Indie pop and dirty, sexy rock!”

At the young age of 14, singer/songwriter/guitarist Dave Green joined with drummer Marc Hogan, to create and release their first CD, The People. After three years of sharpening their talents, the band-mates went their separate ways, each in search of their own, unique musical styles. While spending a year in Canada, the separation period proved to be the stimulus Green’s writing needed. Inspired by the new possibilities, he invited Hogan to join him and reunite. Bass player, Baz Robinson was added shortly thereafter to complete the line-up, and in October 2007, The Filthy Souls were re-born. 

Back in the UK, the band became regulars on the music scene, playing everywhere from the small pubs in Wigan, to the auspicious Manchester Academy 3. Crisscrossing the British Isles, they hit the festival circuit, opening for such artists as Tim Burgess of the Charlatans, Finger Eleven and Cage The Elephant. During this time, Green notes, “We were all about the music, not just playing, but making it a part of our very being, and giving that to the fans.”

As with any ambitious group of Brits, success on the isle isn’t enough. So, next up for the band . . . Invasion USA. In July, 2008, The Filthy Souls flew to the States to tour Los Angeles, San Diego and Las Vegas, playing such notable venues as The Viper Room, Key Club, The Roxy, and Club Moscow. Following their tour’s success, they self-released their debut single “Boys Will Be Out for a Fight” in November 2008, followed by the EP, Save Me in February 2009.

The music of this Brit rock/pop group has already been featured on American TV. The Filthy Souls have been heard on the 2009 season of One Tree Hill, Vanished and ABC’s Greek. The band was actually written into the script for ABC’s hit comedy 
10 Things I Hate About You. The Filthy Souls have recently made live appearances on Manchester’s Channel M, as well as having been heard in radio interviews with L.A.’s Camp Freddy on Indie 103.1, NPR’s KCRW Los Angeles, Tom Robinson on BBC 6 Introducing and on Manchester’s Key 103.

The buzz is electric, the excitement is building, and the momentum is launching this indie-rock band straight into the heart of the music industry. Now is the time to stand up, let go, and experience The Filthy Souls.

www.ManchesterMusic.co.uk - 

""THE FILTHY SOULS are one of those bands that does exactly what it says on the tin: full-blooded garage rock with a fuck load of spirit. A bit golden age Strokes with bigger balls, a bit Black Rebel, a bit bluesy, alt-country even; music that actually sounds sweaty and sexy. No surprises then that they come from the capital of such things... Detroit? New York? Nope. Wigan. Much like their geographical and spiritual neighbours Moco (one of whom's down watching) this is rock'n'roll that's not short on soul.""

""The Filthy Souls are an unsigned rock band from Wigan. Formed late in 2007 the band are quickly bubbling to the top of the unsigned music scene and are set to tour LA (USA) in the Summer of 2008.

199,caroline rose,330262,5276885,"Caroline Elizabeth Rose (born October 19, 1989) is an American singer, songwriter, musician and producer. After releasing two records of folk and country-inspired music, she released a pop-rock album Loner in 2018. Superstar was released on March 6, 2020. Her most recent album, The Art of Forgetting, was released on March 24, 2023. 

Born in 1989 in Long Island, Rose grew up in Center Moriches, New York. The daughter of two artists, Rose began writing songs and poems at age 13. Rose attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she graduated in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in architecture.

In 2012, Rose and producer/multi-instrumentalist Jer Coons launched a Kickstarter to fund the production of Rose's first album America Religious. The album, blending American folk music, country, and rockabilly styles was self-published later that year. Two years later, Rose released her first nationally distributed album, I Will Not Be Afraid on Little Hi! Records. Like the first album, it was produced with Jer Coons and featured music in a variety of Americana musical styles, including two songs previously released on America Religious.

Following the release of I Will Not Be Afraid, Rose took an extended hiatus from touring and releasing new material, while she explored new musical directions that would broaden her sound. After three years, numerous personnel changes, a signing to mother + Pop Music, and a switch to New West Records, Rose released her third album. The new album, Loner, was co-produced by Rose and Paul Butler of The Bees, and represented a radical shift away from the musical style of her previous work, blending pop and alternative rock elements, and incorporating prominent synthesizers throughout. Notably, this album also saw a change in lyrical tone, incorporating a number of overtly humorous, sarcastic, and satirical songs. Although Rose played most of the instruments on the album, she formed a new band to perform on tour. 

Prior to Loner's release, Rose released ""Money"" and ""Soul No. 5"" with accompanying music videos. Rose released a music video for ""Jeannie Becomes a Mom"" on October 17, 2018. The video, which was directed by Amanda Speva, features Abby Pierce as the titular character, depicting Jeannie moving into a new home, performing a dance routine with the movers, and preparing a rainbow Jell-O cake. The song was ranked the fifteenth-best single of the year by National Public Radio.

On January 7, 2020, Rose announced a new album called Superstar, releasing a single and a music video for the song ""Feel The Way I Want"". The video was shot on an iPhone over the course of an 11-day roadtrip from Hollywood, California to Hollywood, Florida, documenting the protagonist's journey after she travels to the wrong Hollywood for an audition. According to Rose, the album is a ""cinematic pop album that tells a story of someone who leaves behind everything she knows and loves in search for something bigger and more glamorous. It's a story about losing yourself but also finding the brazen self-confidence to follow a dream."" The album Superstar was released on March 6, 2020, and Caroline Rose made her television debut on February 24, 2020, performing ""Feel The Way I Want"" on Late Night with Seth Meyers. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Caroline+Rose"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Carlile's music has been categorized in several genres, including pop, rock, alternative country, and folk. She released her first album, 'Brandi Carlile', on July 12, 2005.

In the beginning, Columbia Records signed Carlile in late 2004 on the strength of songs she'd been recording periodically at home. Released in 2005, Brandi Carlile showcased those early songs along with several newly recorded tracks. Shortly after the release of Brandi Carlile, she left her home in Seattle and set out with the Hanseroth brothers, with whom she'd worked on her earliest recordings and independent regional tours. The tightly knit trio, which forms the core of her band today, spent the better part of two years on the road honing the songs that would later become part of her album ""The Story"".

In 2005, she was featured on Rolling Stone's ""10 Artists to Watch in 2005"" list. By the end of 2006, Carlile had embarked on several headlining tours and supported a variety of artists including Ray LaMontagne, The Fray, Chris Isaak, Tori Amos, and Shawn Colvin.

Her second album, The Story, was released in April 2007. It was produced by T Bone Burnett and includes a collaboration with the Indigo Girls on ""Cannonball."" The album was recorded in an eleven-day-long session with Carlile , the twins (Tim and Phil Hanseroth) and drummer Matt Chamberlain to capture the raw intensity of Carlile's live performances. The crack in Carlile's vocals during the title track, ""The Story"", came out by accident and was a direct result of the way the album was recorded. Carlile herself describes the vocals as ""technically wrong but emotionally right.""

Carlile was exposed to a wider audience when ABC's Grey's Anatomy showcased three of her songs: ""Tragedy,"" ""What Can I Say,"" and ""Throw It All Away"". In April 2007, Grey's Anatomy debuted a version of the video for the single The Story interspersed with footage from the show. On May 3, 2007, a special two-hour episode of ""Grey's Anatomy"" featured Carlile's song ""Turpentine"" during footage of the ""Grey's Anatomy"" spin-off, ""Private Practice"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1) Raveena Aurora, also known mononymously as Raveena, is an North American singer and songwriter. Her debut EP, Shanti, was released independently in 2017. Her first album, Lucid, was released independently in 2019 and distributed through Empire Distribution.

Aurora was born in Massachusetts and grew up in both Queens, New York, U.S.A. and Stamford, Connecticut, U.S.A. Her parents immigrated to Queens from India in 1984. She became exposed to R&B, Soul, Jazz and Folk music in middle school, which piqued her interest in music and influenced her musical style later in life.

2) Raveena born on 18 May 1997 in Antwerp, Belgium is a British musician with parents of Indian origin, Dimple and Rajiv Mehta. Raveena is an elder sister to sister Kareena and brother Rajveer. Her last.fm user name is RaveenaMusic.

As a child, Raveena showed fascinating interest in music and arts. She developed artistic skills at an early age and grew fond of music and instruments. At the age of 5 years, her exposure to music was formalized through her school and by Piano lessons. Her initial performances were made at school and community talent shows.

Later, she started formal dance and singing lessons through coach Suchita Parte, whose recording ""Designer Bliss” is one of the best selling Indian albums of all time. Through encouragement from her family and uncle Vishal, she started recording her first album “From Deep Within” at Earth Studios in Mumbai (India). Tushar Parte, husband and composer of Suchita’s successful release, was in charge of the compositions.

The result was a wonderful collection of songs full of love, hope and happiness, masterfully combining the deepest, most beautiful melodies, all of which will soon be in your hands. MR. DJ, the song presented here as Raveena’s debut single, recorded when she was 11, not only contains one of the most rocking tunes you’ve ever heard; it’s also an extremely powerful and emotional song that you’ll never get tired to listen to. So here she is. Ready to take your world. Now listen to the song, watch the music video, and enjoy. The best is yet to come! <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Raveena"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

220,concernedape,273658,11805435,"Eric Barone (born December 3, 1987), known professionally as ConcernedApe, is an American game designer and musician. He is best known for independently creating the video game Stardew Valley. He programmed the game, created all art assets as well as all sound effects and music.

Barone was born in Los Angeles and spent his childhood in Auburn, Washington. Barone had practiced basic programming but did not consider making video games as a career. Unable to find employment after graduating college, he initially began developing Stardew Valley in 2012 in order to practice programming in C#, and planned to put the game on his resume for potential employers. Barone worked on the game daily as its sole creator until its release in 2016. 

He was praised for creating the game independently, as its sole designer, programmer, animator, artist, composer, and writer. To complete the game, Barone worked 10 hours a day, seven days a week, for four and a half years. For part of that time, he lived with his parents to save money before moving out with his girlfriend to Capitol Hill, Seattle. 

Barone initially released Stardew on the PC before later developing it for other consoles. By February 2024, he had sold over 30 million copies.

In 2017, he was named by Forbes magazine in their list ""30 Under 30: Games"" for his work on Stardew Valley. Since 2019, Barone has been assisted on Stardew Valley by another designer.

On October 10, 2023, Barone announced the first Stardew Valley concert tour, Stardew Valley: Festival of Seasons, featuring a selection of music from the game performed live by a chamber orchestra. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/ConcernedApe"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

225,l'impératrice,535382,12319996,"L'Impératrice (French pronunciation: [lɛ̃peʁatʁis]; ""The Empress"") is a project that began in 2012, a French band with a myriad of dreams that have now become reality. However, the vision of each of them has not changed that much as they have become an international band and they claim to keep their feet very firmly on the ground, as, in their words, it is always a work in progress. Despite this, there are still achievements to unlock, one of which is playing at Madison Square Garden, one of their favourite venues.

The band was initially formed by keyboardist Charles de Boisseguin, who started the project solo until he met the other keyboardist, Hagni Gwon. Gwon later called in bassist David Gaugué and drummer Tom Daveau. Soon after, guitarist Achille Trocellier joined, and the group was officially formed in 2012. In 2015, french singer Flore Benguigui joined the group. After making 3 studio albums and spending 9 years with the band, Flore announced her departure from L'Impératrice in September 2024, citing ""profound personal, artistic, and fundamental disagreements"" between her and the band. Less than a month later, the band revealed their new vocalist Louve.

Their pop, funk and electronic sounds, Flore's sweet tone singing in French, coupled with a retro yet futuristic aesthetic, broke the language barrier and took them to stages they could never have imagined. After albums and EPs such as ""Sonate Pacifique"", ""Odyssée"", ""Vanille Fraise"" and ""Matahari"", their most recent album is 2024's ""Pulsar"", with songs in English and French, which included collaborations with artists such as Erick the Architect and Maggie Rogers.

L'Impératrice's retro pop and disco music places them as heirs to the French Touch trend pioneered by Daft Punk, to whom they have paid homage in their music videos, and represented by groups such as Air and Phoenix. But in their case, they pride themselves on being a band that doesn't rely so much on synthesizers, but plays their instruments entirely live.

They once received an email from a fan who congratulated them on their EP L'Odyssée but couldn't understand why on vinyl Flore Benguigui's voice sounded so different from the YouTube videos, almost sounding like a boy. The answer to the mystery: he had been playing the record at the wrong speed. This happy accident led the band to release a slowed-down version of the work. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/L%27Imp%C3%A9ratrice"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

227,slow pulp,675889,16460751,"The dreamy songs of Midwest indie rock outfit Slow Pulp draw on moody shoegaze, hooky grunge, and intimate lo-fi fare. The band made their full-length debut with Moveys in 2020.
Guitarist Henry Stoehr, bass player Alexander Leeds, and drummer Theodore Mathews started making music together as friends in the sixth grade, naming their first band from letters in their first names. It wasn't until high school, when Emily Massey contributed guitar and backing vocals to later incarnation Slow Pulp's second EP, 2017's EP2, that an improved vision of the band clicked. They soon made Massey lead singer and took down a debut EP that didn't involve her.

Now a four-piece, the group worked up the stand-alone tracks ""At Home"" and ""Steel Birds,"" which they self-released in 2018 while relocating to Chicago. Written and mostly recorded in a cabin in Michigan in January 2019, the Big Day EP followed in May 2019. Slow Pulp headed out on tour with Alex G later in the year, as they worked on their full-length debut. The project was not without obstacles; material was scrapped, and Massey struggled with her own health problems before returning to Madison to help her parents recover from a car accident. The COVID-19 pandemic soon limited travel. With Stoehr acting as main engineer, producer, and mixer, they were able to complete the album long-distance.

230,s. carey,464115,5412663,"S. Carey is American musician Sean Carey of Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Carey is best known as the drummer and supporting vocalist of indie folk band Bon Iver. In August 2010, Carey released his first solo album, All We Grow.

The debut album is the result of a young lifetime spent immersed in music.  As a band member of Bon Iver from the very beginning, Carey endured a flip of his formal training to step firmly into a worldwide-touring rock band.  His performance degree in classical percussion from the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire and his love for jazz drumming prepared him for a central role in the inspiring force of the Bon Iver live show.

All We Grow is a convergence of Carey's Waltz For Debbie era Bill Evans inflected jazz tendencies, and traditional rock band experience, taking leads from Mark Hollis' Talk Talk. It also retests the waters of modern classical composition, investigating the moodiness generated by percussive repetition in a manner familiar to fans of Steve Reich. In his downtime on tour with Bon Iver, Sean would spend time pining for his soul-mate's arms, and in that context, dreaming and composing.  During infrequent tour breaks at home he would patiently record these pieces, adding layers each time. Two years later, the parts converged to make an album.

For as much room to breathe as Carey allows his compositions, there are incredibly dynamic moments of bombast held right next to moments of subtle depth and texture. Engineered by Jaime Hansen and Brian Joseph, intermittently at home and at April Base (Justin Vernon's studio outside Eau Claire), All We Grow is an all-encompassing headphone experience as intimate as chamber music and as ambitious as a symphony.

While many are familiar with the cabin mythology of Bon Iver, the story behind Sean joining the band is equally kismet.  After hearing through mutual friends that Justin was looking to put together a band, he spent two weeks in his bedroom listening to For Emma, Forever Ago on Myspace, dissecting and learning the drum and vocal parts so well that Justin invited him to join the band upon Sean's approach.

All We Grow is a classic album born without expectation and met with adoration - a cathartic result of Carey's extraordinary and vibrant life experiences that resonates loss, dreams and heart in a manner so instantly relatable, you feel as though you can touch it. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/S.+Carey"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2) On their previous tour, Disclosure arrived in Newport News, VA, 4 1/2 hours from home to learn that their show had been cancelled. Here, most bands would have called it a day, but instead they frantically called friends to search for shows via MySpace. They ended up playing for free and headlining a show in Richmond, VA. This is just one of many stories that showcase Disclosure’s dedication.

In the past 3 years they have released 3 albums, have been part of an East Coast distributed compilation, performed in 7 states, went on 2 self-booked tours, and played over 50 shows. They have an upcoming full East Coast tour scheduled for July/August 2010 and they have no plans of slowing down. 

3) Side project of Crunch Pod artist C/A/T. With the Disclosure project, Ben Arp of C/A/T shifts the focus towards tense samples and hard rhythmic sequences. While C/A/T has had a more abstract sound, Disclosure presents a more sonically straight-forward approach to songwriting. “Full Disclosure” attempts to further lift the veil and reveal the hidden hand that orchestrates world events. Extremely limited run of 25 copies and available only at Crunch Pod and was only available at live C/A/T performances in Summer 2005.
CD-R version is out of print. This album was recently re-issued as a digital download direct from Crunch Pod.

4) An Alternative/Powerpop/Rock band from Faringdon, UK. Formed 5 years ago Disclosure have earnt their reputation as one of the most exciting bands to emerge from the Swindon area through relentless gigging, energetic shows and great sounds. Performing on stage with the likes of Young Guns and The Rileys, Disclosure have played at many of the biggest and most respected venues and festivals in and around Oxfordshire. Now signed with New Vision Records and having recently released their latest EP at the o2 academy2 Islington, Disclosure have never sounded so focussed and relevant and this year will be hitting venues around the UK.

He quickly built a loyal following, and eventually nabbed a residency DJ'ing at London's Chibuku Club.

In 2014, his remix of Jessie Ware's song ""You & I (Forever)"" caught the attention of Ware's label, PMR Records, who then signed him. A year later, he released his debut EP, Shivers. In 2016, Lewis delivered his sophomore EP, Yours, which included the track ""Holding Back,"" featuring Gallant. Lewis' 2017 output consisted of the Toulouse-aided single ""Times We Had"" and the solo track ""Smart Aleck Kill."" He returned in January 2018 with ""Aura,"" a bright yet low-key track featuring vocalist J Warner. The song appeared on the disco-influenced Dusk, which kicked off a trilogy of club-centric EPs slated to appear under the combined full-length album title of Dusk, Dark, Dawn. Meanwhile, he continued releasing singles including 2019's ""Blue"" and the Clairo collaboration ""Throwaway."" ~ Matt Collar <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/SG+Lewis"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Growing up, he was so shy that he would write songs avidly but hide them inside his mattress. At 20, he moved out of his parents' house to study creative writing at UCLA and finally gathered the courage to start performing music. After purchasing a beat-up guitar from a friend, he taught himself to play and accompany himself. He grew quickly as an artist at UCLA, soon performing weekly alongside the university's most esteemed musicians. Now graduated, he creates soul-infused folk music using guitar and unique arrangements built on loop pedals.

Recently, SPIN Magazine described him as a ""soul-folk warrior"".

The band's original members are Rachael Price (lead vocals), Mike ""McDuck"" Olson (trumpet, guitar), Bridget Kearney (upright bass), and Mike Calabrese (drums). Akie Bermiss (keyboards) joined the band on tour in 2017 and is on their 2018 album. Lake Street Dive started at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. The band was named after a street with many dive bars in Olson's hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota. 

After meeting as fellow students at the New England Conservatory in Boston, the band was hand picked by Minneapolis trumpet/guitar player Mike Olson and named after an actual neighborhood of seedy bars in his hometown. Vocalist Rachael Price came from outside Nashville, Tennessee, stand-up bassist Bridget Kearney was an Iowa native, while drummer Mike Calabrese called Philadelphia home. “I wasn’t only impressed with their musicianship,” says Olson, who acquired the nickname “McDuck” while at the conservatory for his reclusive ways. “They were also a lot of fun just to hang out with. The first four years of rehearsals were more like glorified dinner parties.” <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lake+Street+Dive"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
