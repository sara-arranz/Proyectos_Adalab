And I really wanted to understand where I come from and live it. A lot of times I went to Colombia and, even though I spoke Spanish and was always speaking Spanish with my parents, I still felt like an outsider. I wasn’t 100 percent part of it. I wanted to give my roots the importance they deserve. ”His June 2019 song ""Runaway"" was his first foray into bilingual songwriting. In December 2019, he collaborated with South Korean boy group Monsta X for the song ""Magnetic"", which features verses from Yatra in Spanish and a bridge from Monsta X in Spanglish.

El mayor tiene solo 26 años y el menor 21. Son jóvenes, sí, pero ya son conscientes de su éxito y más que un grupo, ellos se consideran una familia, pues lo más importante, antes de cantar, es la unión y la lealtad a su amistad.

Todo comenzó en junio del año 2007 cuando se conocieron en un asado que organizó un amigo que tenían en común. Conversando se dieron cuenta de que los cuatro eran músicos y terminaron cantando hasta las 6 de la mañana.

Días después El Profe buscó a Dim y al Llanero y les propuso formar un grupo, pero Dim dijo que sí con la condición de que también incluyeran a Pablito, quien estaba de viaje en ese momento en Contadora, Panamá.

Fue tanta la emoción y la ansiedad por crear el grupo que inmediatamente llamaron a Pablito a Panamá y el aceptó sin dudarlo.

Paso a paso
Su segundo encuentro, o mejor dicho su primer ensayo, fue en el club house de un amigo del edificio San Mitchel, en el piso 21, desde donde se podía ver la ciudad d medellin completa. Este se convirtió durante varios meses en su ensayadero oficial y era allí donde pasaban noches enteras montando las canciones.

""Durante esas noches soñábamos con que algún día escucharían nuestras composiciones en todas esas casa que veíamos desde allá"", cuenta Dim.

""Y creo que lo estamos logrando, pero ahora la idea es que también nos escuchen en aquellas de las que solo veíamos la luz, arriba en las montañas"", continúa El Profe.

Su nombre
A la hora de pensar en cómo se llamarían, dieron muchas vueltas y hasta lo consultaron con sus familias y sus profesores.

Al principio le buscaron por el lado de sus iniciales o pensaron en jugar un poco con los nombres de David y Pablo, pero luego de intentarlo por muchos lados, se les ocurrió Piso 21, pues fue a esta altura donde realmente conformaron el grupo.

Pero a este nombre también le han encontrado una metáfora, pues según ellos, indica que para arriba es adonde quieren llegar, dando pasos lentos, pero seguros y muy largos.

Precisamente antes de empezar cada concierto, el grupo se reúne para gritar su frase favorita ""Piso 21, vamos pa'arriba papá"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Piso+21"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

23,natti natasha,306648,4361358,"Natalia Alexandra Gutiérrez, known by her stage name Natti Natasha, is a Dominican reggaeton singer, songwriter, and actress. Hailing from Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Natasha grew up surrounded by endless musical influences and enrolled in Santiago’s School of Fine Arts at the age of seven where she developed her singing abilities, describing her time at the school as “one of the best of her life.” Her studio experience would begin as a teenager when she would record songs as a hobby and later alongside friends.

This all led up to her decision to make the biggest and riskiest move of her life, and that was to move to the United States. She settled in the Bronx, New York, or “the City of the Dreams and Dreamers” for young, aspiring musicians like her at the time. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Natti called the move “one of the craziest moves anyone ever did in her family,” and that she often looks back at the decision and wonders what she was doing. Natti would hop from studio to studio, working without pay, but to her, this was a way to get her name out there. A producer friend from Santiago would soon step in and lend her his New York studio.

Natti’s first-ever break came when icon Don Omar signed her to his record label, the Orfanato Music Group, and the pair would go on to make history for years to come. Their collaborations “Dutty Love,” “Tus Movimientos,” “Perdido en tus Ojos,” and a “Hold Ya” remix with Gyptian made waves across Latin America and introduced the world to future reggaeton royalty. Her debut project, an EP titled “All About Me” was released on March 28, 2012.

Natti would continue to make big career moves throughout the years including her departure from Don Omar’s record label and signing onto Pina Records in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2017 when her big breakout would come once and for all. Not only did she record and release a collaboration titled “Otra Cosa” alongside the legendary Daddy Yankee, but she also released what was arguably the biggest song of 2017. “Criminal” featuring Ozuna became an instant hit upon its release, the music video amassing over 1 billion views in just five months and becoming the most watched music video by a female singer released that year.

2019 saw the release of her much-anticipated debut album, “ilumiNATTI,” on February 15. 15 tracks made up the project with two collaborations in total, “Te Lo Dije'' with Anitta and “Soy Mía” with Kany García. Standout track “La Mejor Version de Mi” would transform into a bachata hit with its remix featuring bachata king Romeo Santos.

Natti’s sophomore album titled “NATTIVIDAD” would be released two years later on September 24, 2021 with 17 tracks featuring several chart-topping collaborators such as Becky G, Maluma, and Prince Royce. The release was followed up by the six-episode docuseries titled “Everybody Loves Natti” which documented her pregnancy and relationship with fiancé Raphy Pina.

Abraham was discovered in 2009, when he was ten, by producers of the record label EMI Music Spain, who happened across Abraham's videos in Youtube and his multiple performances in the television show Menuda Noche on the Canal Sur TV of Andalucia, Spain.

52,plan b,1077240,22335686,"There are several artists and bands with this name:

1) Plan B (real name Ben Drew, b. 1983) is a rapper from Forest Gate, London. From the age of 11 he attended Anglo European School in Ingatestone Essex, before transfering to Tom Hood, an inner-city comprehensive. He has described his character, in these school days, as ""a bit of a cunt"". He is signed to 679 Recordings, home to UK rap act The Streets. His unique sound is characterised by his use of acoustic beats and lyrics involving drugs, rape, murder and underage sex. He was placed fourth in the BBC's ""Sound of 2006"" competition.

His second album was released in April 2010; The Defamation of Strickland Banks was released on 12 April 2010. The album is a departure from the sound heard on Plan B's debut album Who Needs Actions When You Got Words, with the rapper's sophomore effort showcasing much more of his singing ability. Lyrically the album's songs tell the fictitious tale of one Strickland Banks, a sharp-suited British soul singer who finds fame with bitter-sweet love songs like the album's opener ""Love Goes Down"", but then loses everything when he ends up in prison for a crime he didn't commit.

The album was a great success, reaching #1 in the UK album charts, and three singles from the album reached the top 20 of the UK singles charts, with 'Stay Too Long' reaching #9 and 'She Said' reaching #3.

The Ill Manors Songfacts reports that on March 23, 2012 Plan B released “Ill Manors,” the title track of the soundtrack to the British film of the same title, which he wrote and directed.

2) Plan B (real name James van Leuven) is a producer/musician from Seattle, WA. On Like a Ship Sailing, Plan B's James van Leuven steps beyond his drumming for Automaton and allows percussion to be the focus. Laying a foundation of trip-hop beats, van Leuven (who handles nearly all of the instrumentation) implements sampling and crawly guitars and bass. The record possesses the darker atmospheres of trip-hop but without the accompanying vocals. There's also a spy film aura that permeates much of the album. Sometimes it gets a little too dark with the disturbing line, ""Howard just said he was going to blow his brains out next Tuesday."" It's balanced by a child asking, ""Have you ever been in love?,"" in ""Love,"" which flirts with breakbeats. ""Come out Strong"" has a finger-snapping cool jazz vibe with trumpet from Bill Jones. This project might be ""plan B"" for van Leuven, but his great job with live percussion makes it grade-A post-rock.

After the release of 2 LPs in 2002 and 2006 + 1 EP in 2003, Plan B Seattle was over-shadowed by the pop success of the british Plan B Ben Drew in 2006.  Since then Plan B Seattle has stopped releasing music under this moniker.

Cazzu es una artista de música urbana que se caracteriza por haber sido siempre muy voluble. Ha trabajado muchos estilos durante toda su carrera, pero encontró en el trap y el reguetón su verdadero lenguaje. El trap es por definición un compendio de géneros aglutinados, y Cazzu conoce perfectamente todos y cada uno de ellos.


La trapera estudió cine, y su conocimiento de la estética visual le ha ayudado mucho a la hora de conformar la suya propia. Su estilo es desinhibición en estado puro. Cargada de energía, para dar caña con cada tema.

Cazzu, con temas suaves que invitan a bailar y a moverse, es conocedora de todos esos géneros tan interesantes que conforman el trap argentino. Por ello, la trapera es sin duda una de las reinas del trap latino e internacional.

Se presentó en el panorama con su primer tema Killa. Una canción que sienta unas bases muy claras, una carta de presentación como mujer empoderada, llena de espíritu underground. La artista se ha ganado el respeto de todos los artistas de trap del panorama latino, llegando a colaborar con muchos de ellos.

Sus colaboracion con Bad Bunny, Duki y Khea en LOCA y LOCA REMIX es un himno del trap mundial.

Sin duda, Cazzu, es una artista de pies a cabeza. Su presencia es poderosa y llena de arte propia. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cazzu"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

67,mau y ricky,164789,2213714,"For the past few years, Mauricio and Ricky Montaner had been busy writing songs for other artists like Thalía, Miguel Bosé, Diego Boneta, Yuridia, Leslie Grace, to name a few, until recently when they decided the songs they were composing would be for their EP titled Arte under the label of Sony Music.

The young duo, Mau y Ricky, sons of music icon Ricardo Montaner, have released the album's first single, ""Voy Que Quemo,"" a song they decided best represents the music that is coming out in the LP, expected to release in July. ""After writing so many songs, it just seemed natural to start recording an album,"" Ricky, 25, tells Billboard, speaking on behalf of the duo since Mau was on vocal rest. ""We have 10 songs and an 11th that is an instrumental track. 'Voy Que Quemo' seemed like the best song to release first, and we're feeling super excited and nervous.""

Mau y Ricky partnered with Latin Grammy winner Julio Reyes Copello to produce their album and credit him for allowing them to grow artistically and teach them about following their intuition. ""We've grown as producers and songwriters, thanks to him. We also learned that the intuition of an artist is so important and it's something that needs to be respected because your intuition will differentiate you from others. We learned to write for ourselves and put out songs that will represent who we are.""

And that's exactly what Mau y Ricky did. They followed their intuition after listening to their song ""Arte"" which was almost going to be pitched to Wisin, but Ricky says, ""It didn't feel right for another artist to sing this song."" Another man they have to thank for guiding them since they started composing at a very young age is their father, who has written hit singles like ""La Cima del Cielo,"" ""Déjame Llorar"" and ""Me Va a Extrañar.""

""We've written songs together, so working with him helps you grow a lot because he's a very hard critic. Every song I've written since I was 8 years old, I'd run it by him and he'd give me feedback. He actually just heard the final product of our album and he loved it, thank God. But the best thing is that he's a fan of ours and we're huge fans of him. Yeah, he's my dad, but I'm a huge Ricardo Montaner fan.""

Besides a new album, Mau y Ricky fans can expect to see them onstage soon as they go out on tour. ""We haven't toured in such a long time because we were busy writing for others then started working on this album, but the stage is our natural habitat and where we feel most comfortable."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mau+y+Ricky"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

75,ryan castro,283169,5213126,"Ryan Castro es una de las nuevas caras del reggaetón y, aunque en sus videos juega con la clásica estética aspiracional de los carros de alta gama y las mansiones, su proyecto nació en el barrio Pedregal, al norte de Medellín. El colegio, las calles y los vecinos del sector pueden dar fe de cómo fue el comienzo de su historia.

Luego de salir del colegio, a los 16 años, se proyectó para hacer música a nivel profesional. Inspirado por las música y las películas que vio de 50 Cent, Eminem o Daddy Yankee, Ryan salió a buscar su primer público: los usuarios del transporte urbano.

“Empecé a cantar en los buses a los 17 años porque empecé a sentir la necesidad de hacer algo y ayudar a la familia. La experiencia fue muy bacana y enriquecedora porque me hizo ganar mucha confianza”, cuenta el paisa.

En los buses hacía covers de Kafu Banton, de Baroni One Time y una que otra composición original. Su segunda gran plataforma fueron las discotecas del Valle de Aburrá, donde también cantó sus propias canciones como Morena, que es un rap romántico, y Mi Styling, un dancehall.

Luego de tocar varias puertas y ver limitadas sus oportunidades tomó la decisión de irse del país para trabajar, ahorrar dinero e invertirlo en su proyecto. Llegó a Curazao y trabajó en hoteles y restaurantes. Cada peso que ganó lo usó para costear sus producciones y los videos musicales.

En Curazao grabó dos canciones y gracias al bendito internet logró que se sonaran en su natal Medallo. Muchos creyeron que Ryan era extranjero.

Esas canciones vincularon a Ryan con la compañía discográfica del caleño Kevin Roldán. Para 2021, su nombre estará dos veces en el nuevo álbum de Kevin Roldán y, además, lanzará su disco debut que lleva por nombre El Cantante Del Guetto, un homenaje a sus raíces y su barrio. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Castro"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

76,valentino,72841,467037,"There are multiple musicians/bands under the same name.

1.) Valentino -- Pop-rock group from Sarajevo ""Valentino"" was founded in 1982. Group founder was the lead guitarist and songwriter Zijo Rizvanbegović - Valentino.  Zijo posted an advertisement in ""Oslobođenje"" (Sarajevo daily newspaper) looking for a lead singer and found Suad Jakirlić - Jaka. 

Valentino was a favorite of Goran Bregović, so they toured together with Bijelo Dugme. 
Goran Bregović played guitar on Valentino 1st album for a song ""Pazi na Ritam"". The Hit Song from that album was the song ""Volim te još"" (I still love you). 

Second album was titled ""Valentino II"" and released in 1985.  There were new additions to the group  Nikša Bratoš (on keyboards) and Ademir Volić - Kufi (drummer). They previously played in a band ""Bonton Baja"" which dissolved because of some government investigation concerning taxes. This caused their LP record to be pulled off the shelves minutes after being released, but a few people were lucky enough to purchase a handful. They are considered a collector's item and are very rare. 

The original line up of Valentino group consisted of: Zijo Rizvanbegović (guitar), Nikša Bratoš (keyboards), Suad Jakirlić (lead vocal), Emir Ćolaković (bass) i Ademir Volić (drums). 

Third album came out two years later (1987).  The Hit song was ""Oka tvoja dva"" (Your two eyes). 

Suad Jakirlić joined the army and after returning did not rejoin the group, or continue with his music career. In 1988 Nikša Bratoš moves to a new band [artist:Crvena Jabuka]. Dražen Ričl and Aljoša Buha, the main members of Crvena Jabuka died in 1987. 

New Valentino lead singer - Gogo Prušina helps make the fourth album. Zoran Šerbedžija joined the group as well as a new guitar player in 1988. 

Fifth album - ""Ponekad noću kad grad spava"" (Sometimes when she sleeps at night) (1989). Željko Brodarić - Jappa was the producer, Samir Šestan was on the keyboards, and a guitar player Zoran Petrović. 

As the War on the Balkans began in 1992, ""Valentino"", like many other groups, stopped working and making new music. After the War Zijo ""Valentino"" gathered the group together and got to working on another ablum titled “Moja kuća putujuća” (My Traveling House) with guests such as Hari Varešanović (Hari Mata Hari), Saša Lošić (Plavi Orkestar) and Alen Islamović. 

Six years after that album comes “Sve su se moje cure udale” (All of my girls have gotten married), which ended up sounding nothing like pop-rock sounds of Valentino but rather like ""narodna"" or country folk music. 

In 2006 there was ""Valentino 7"" under the production of City Records.



2.) Valentino is an Italo Disco project produced by Mauro Farina, Giuliano Crivellente, Franco Diaferia and Fabrizio Rizzolo, who also put his voice in the songs. Their hits are “Tonight”, “Tender Love”, “For Your Love” and “You Are The Sunshine”.


3.) Valentino is an eurodance act that released the single “Brand New Place”.


4.) Valentino Kanzyani is one of Slovenia's biggest music exports. As well as spinning techno and house on three decks across the world to huge crowds and acclaim he has released a barrage of dancefloor anthems for labels such as Primevil, Yoshi Toshi, Intec, Wet Musik, Tronic, Primate, Consumer Recreation and his and Umeks jointly run Recycled Loops and Earresistible imprints. If anyone can lay claim to putting Slovenia on the techno map then the name Valentino Kanzyani ranks high as one of its biggest propagators.

Already a big name DJ within his native Slovenia, in 1995 a club called Ambasada Gavioli opened and Valentino Kanzyani became known as the man behind one of Slovenias most famous venues. During a three and a half year period he booked and played with literally every DJ from around the globe but as the new millennium approached he left to oncentrate on his own DJing and production work. It was after going into the studio with his old friend, Umek that Valentino was to release his first record as Recycled Loops on Primevil in the summer of 1999. Thus, Valentino Kanzyanis name was soon to be heard in DJ sets all over the world and similarly his DJ gigs went supernova as he joined the jet set elite of globe-trotting record spinners.

Following the success of their initial release Umek and Valentino set up Recycled Loops as a label and have never looked back. Now having released some 12 records the duo also co-run Earresistible for their more house inspired production work whilst Valentino Kanzyanis single-handed production skills have graced labels as varied as Intec with the House Soul EP and Tronic (Burros Eslovenos) to Yoshi Toshi with the massive Flying whilst he has most recently remixed Carl Coxs new single, gaining Essential Selection status from Pete Tong.

Earresistible evolved due to the pairs shared passion for tribal house and elements of this and Valentinos techno side can be witnessed on the expertly mixed CDs Rock The Discotheque Volumes 1 and 2 (Matrix Musik) and the 40 odd remixes he has carried out on labels such as 23rd Century, Premier Sounds, 20:20, Urbana, Shine, ZYX, Intec, Wet Musik and the list goes on
Valentinos DJing has taken him to every corner of the world. His three deck skills are second to none.

77,farruko,665355,8402805,"Farruko is a reggaeton and Latin pop singer from Puerto Rico. His given name is Carlos Efren Reyes, and he was born in Bayamon, Puerto Rico in 1991. At the age of 16, he began to post his songs under his stage name to MySpace. His first single, ""Sexo Fuera del Planeta,"" gained thousands of followers, and from there he explored the potential of other social media networks. Due to his massive success on the Internet, he came to the attention of Puerto Rican radio and music industry executives, who enlisted his vocal talents for other artists.

Farruko's debut album, El Talento del Bloque, appeared when he was 18. It was released by Siente Music and distributed by Universal. Most of its 13 songs were self-penned. The set became an almost instant hit, and several singles followed from it. Some of the album's highlights included its collaborative tunes such as ""Su Hija Me Gusta"" with José Feliciano, ""Ella No Es Facil"" with Cosculluela, and ""Traime a Tu Amiga"" with Arcangel and Julio Voltio. He also issued the non-album smash ""Pa Romper la Discoteca"" with Daddy Yankee and Yomo. In 2012, he issued his sophomore offering, TMPR: The Most Powerful Rookie. Its first smash single was ""Feel the Rhythm"" (""Siente el Ritmo""), though it was one of five. As a whole, the set demonstrated that Farruko was as comfortable in electro and pop circles as he was in reggaeton; it was nominated for a Latin Grammy.

After touring throughout Latin America and the United States and establishing large fan bases in locales such as Venezuela and Colombia, he returned to recording in 2014. Farruko Presenta los Menores was released in late October of that year. A week after its release, it topped the Latin Albums chart. Among the notable collaborations are ""Salgo"" with Arcangel, Ñengo Flow, D. Ozi, and Genio y Kelmitt; ""Bebe Conmigo"" with J. Balvin; and ""Interesada"" with Luigi 21+. He won the Premios Juventud for the song ""6 AM"" with J. Balvin and Latin Grammy Awards for Best Urban Performance and Best Urban Song in 2015. In February of that year, he released ""Lejos de Aquí,"" a remix with Yandel. In June, he was Alejandra Guzman's surprise duet partner on her first urban single, ""Adios."" In July, he issued the pre-release track ""Sunset"" (featuring Shaggy and Nicky Jam), which garnered the top spot on various Latin airplay charts. In August, Farruko issued The Ones, a compilation of his charting singles and collaborations; it was a teaser for his next studio effort, Visionary, which appeared in late October. Pre-order excitement for the album propelled it to debut at number one on several Latin album charts; it remained there for several weeks after release. In 2017, he returned with his sixth studio album, Trapficante. As its title suggested, the artist put his money on the fusion of reggaeton and pop urban with the second generation of Latin trap, the latter he considered still in its infancy, making some commercial inroads but still far from its future force as the face of commercial mainstream Latin X pop -- despite its outlaw ties. He openly desired being the face of that future and drew on a host of new generation Latin trap artists as collaborators including Frank Miami, Sharo Torres, Rome, Mambo Kingz, DJ Luian, Maffio, Lil Geniuz, Bad Bunny, and Ladkani. The album was issued in September as Farruko undertook the U.S. leg of his global TrapXFicante tour. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Farruko"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

94,alexis y fido,231064,2180648," Known for their skillful wordplay and their comedic double entendres, reggaeton duo Alexis y Fido, affectionately known as ""Los Pitbulls,"" may be old dogs in the genre, but they have plenty of new tricks that will make audiences sit down and beg for more.

After wooing reggaeton fans with the smash single El Tiburon, featured on Luny Tunes' Mas Flow 2, the hardworking duo is now set to unleash its debut album The Pitbulls, which is promising to make the world bark to a new tune.

""I'm very cerebral; I tend to have a lot of concepts, and Alexis has to let me know whether he thinks they can executed,"" 26-year-old Joel ""Fido"" Martinez says of his contribution to the duo's chemistry. ""I'm much more reserved than Alexis. He's much more animated.""

His partner, 26-year-old Raul ""Alexis"" Ortiz, agrees. ""I'm the aggressive one, the one who gets the crowds jumping.""


Born in Cidra, Puerto Rico, and raised between the towns of Cidra and Cayey, Alexis first made his mark on the reggaeton scene in 1994, when he appeared on DJ Stefano Vol. 2 alongside two neighborhood friends.

Although he knew music was his calling, he found himself secluded from the genre's pioneers by virtue of living outside of the metropolitan area, the hub of activity at that time. Frustrated by the hardships of gaining recognition, he decided to retire and spent almost five years away from the studio.

Similarly, Cayey native Fido started pursuing his musical ambitions at an early age.

""I've been singing since the music was called 'underground,' before it was even named reggaeton,"" he says. ""I started when I was 11 years old. Around the time when Vico C released La Recta Final, I was doing talent shows and performing wherever I could.""

But like Alexis, Fido was discouraged by the competitive nature of the developing movement and decided to put his career on pause for a few years. That is, until, he saw the streets' growing interest in the musical form.

""I started getting back into it when people started selling their own cassette tapes in the streets,"" he recalls. ""We'd record our own tapes at home, wrap them in some plastic and sell them on the street.""

In 1995, Fido scored an appearance on a DJ Stefano production, followed by a single on DJ Nelson's Little Boys from the Underground 3.

But despite the inroads he'd made, Fido felt overwhelmed by the difficulties before him. He once again decided to withdraw from the scene but, this time, he envisioned a different life for himself, enlisting in the Army and executing a four-year stint.

""I was frustrated again - I felt like we weren't being given the opportunities that we deserved because we weren't from the metropolitan area,"" Fido says. ""Back then, they used to say that Carolina was the reggaeton Mecca.""

While Fido was in the military, his good friend Yandel (of the duo Wisin y Yandel) linked up with Wisin during an MC competition in Salinas, Puerto Rico. Their newly established partnership proved fruitful, and they quickly began to raise eyebrows among the genre's frontrunners.
""I've known Yandel since I was in sixth grade,"" Fido says. ""I was the one who told Yandel he needed to start performing. When I came back from the Army and he had teamed up with Wisin, they decided to help me.""

Meanwhile, Alexis made his reentry into the genre in the year 2000, appearing in La Mision III with the songs Sigan Perreando and Otra Noche Mas, and in the production Grayskull with the party anthem Manos Arriba. He then appeared in Wisin y Yandel's De Otra Manera and on both Wisin and Yandel's subsequent solo albums.

""I was friends with Wisin,"" Alexis says. ""We used to sing around the neighborhood together, and Fido was always with Yande, so we were all part of the same crew. After Wisin y Yandel got together, Fido and I spent even more time with each other.""

Still, the two continued to pursue their own separate paths. It wasn't until the compilation album Desafio that Alexis y Fido tested out their potential as a duo.

""There were 23 tracks recorded already so there was only room for one more track in the production,"" Alexis says. ""One of us was going to be omitted so the producers suggested that we perform together.""

Their synergy was palpable and so the two continued to perform together, displaying their skills on songs like Gata Racing off of Blin Blin Vol. 1 and El Palo on El Band 2 Korrupto.

""El Palo was a real turning point in our careers,"" Alexis says of the song that thrust them into the limelight in 2003. ""That was the song that earned us our respect."" Fido agrees wholeheartedly, ""El Palo would have been as big as Gasolina, but the album wasn't funded appropriately so it wasn't really promoted overseas, but in Puerto Rico it was the No. 1 song for months.""

After El Palo's success, the duo was in heavy demand. They recorded such hits as Tocale Bocina on Noriega's Contra La Corriente, El Rolo on La Mision IV and Gata Michu Michu on the top-selling Hector El Bambino Presenta Los Anormales.

They quickly became known as ""Los Pitbulls"" because of Alexis' tendency to bark on his records. He introduced the trademark sound early on in his career at Yandel's prompting.

""One time, I went out with my son and Yandel and his son,"" Alexis says. ""When we were on our way home, both kids started getting cranky, and I started making barking noises to make them laugh. Yandel was like, 'How do you do that? You have to put that in your records!' After that, I started using the slogan 'Alexis el Pitbull ladrando' (Alexis the Pitbull barking). ""

He says that although the ""Pitbull"" moniker was initially his, Fido more than deserves to share the title. ""I'm the one who barks, but Fido is the one who bites,"" he jokes.

After years of performing together and amassing a huge fan in Puerto Rico, the duo unleashed their picaresque song El Tiburon on Luny Tunes' Latin Grammy-nominated album Mas Flow 2, which was released earlier this year. The song established them as international superstars.

""People really appreciate our originality,"" Alexis says. ""We have fun concepts and we use la lot of adult humor. The sexual aspect of our lyrics is only evident to adults, and we make sure that we never say anything that could be offensive towards women.""

For his part, Fido has earned a name for himself as an accomplished beatmaker. He was responsible for the unique rhythmic patterns Wisin y Yandel's En La Disco Bailoteo and Esta Noche Hay Pelea, and he produced the singles Dale Caliente, El Muro and No Me Dejes Solo on Daddy Yankee's multi-platinum-selling Barrio Fino album.

""I made those songs from beginning to end,"" Fido says. ""Urba y Monserrate did the mixing on those tracks, but I came up with the rhythms.""

His production genius is evident in Los Pitbulls through such singles as Eso Ehhh, El Cumbiaton and Tu No Sabes, which he concocted with the help of producer Nesty.

""Sonically, this album has a bit of everything,"" Alexis says. ""El Cumbiaton mixes cumbia with mariachi sounds, Perro Caliente uses beatboxing sounds, Tributo Borincano has a dancehall flavor and Tu no Sabes is a softer ballad-style song.""

The much-anticipated effort features appearances by the likes of Terror Squad's Tony Sunshine, Hector ""el Father,"" Zion y Lennox, Trebol Clan and Baby Ranks and production by heavyweights like Noriega, Nesty, Echo, and Luny Tunes.

With such a remarkable pedigree and an insatiable hunger, it's no mystery why Alexis y Fido are known as reggaeton's only pitbulls. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Alexis+y+Fido"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Born and raised in Montería, Córdoba, he began making music at the age of thirteen with the influence of his older brother, Julián Turizo. When he was sixteen he independently recorded and  three singles: ""Baila Conmigo"", ""Vámonos"" and ""Una Lady Como Tú"", the latter gained wide popularity in 2017, and shortly after he signed under the label La Industria Inc. ""Una Lady Como Tú"" became one of the most listened songs of 2017 in Spanish-speaking countries and made him gain a lot of popularity. As of July 2021, the music video for ""Una Lady Como Tú"" has recieved more than 1.4 billion views on YouTube and the song was streamed more than 495 million times on Spotify.

In October, 2017, he was featured in Piso 21 's song ""Déjala Que Vuelva"", which has gained more than 1.6 billion views on YouTube and more than 560 streams on Spotify. In December of the same year he released his second single ""Esperándote"", which accumulates more than 750 million views on YouTube. In 2018, he released various singles such as: ""Culpables"", ""Sola"", ""Una Vez Más"" with Noriel and ""Vaina Loca"" with Ozuna, the latter became his first Billboard Hot 100-charting hit, peaking at number 94 and staying on the chart for two weeks; while  his song ""Sola"" became his first number one song on the Billboard Latin Airplay chart in March 2019.

From a very young age, Manuel and his brother, Julián, were surrounded by music, playing any instrument that was passed through in the search of perfecting art. Thus, while Julian chose the guitar, Manuel focused on singing and began taking vocal technique classes in Montería with a Cuban teacher. For him, compositions with universal lyrics that seek to reach the soul, are the formula of success and longs for its fans to continue with the support they have shown so far.

Manuel Turizo will grow under the spotlight, between concerts and fans, but he is confident that the humility and goal he has set to be one of the greatest urban artists in Latin America, will make him stay on a fixed course.

125,fanny lu,87252,833821,"Actress and musician Fanny Lú was born in Cali, Colombia, where she attended the Bolivar High School before moving to France to finish her primary education. Upon returning to Latin America, she studied at the University of the Andes, graduating with a degree in industrial engineering. While still in college, Lú maintained a television career, beginning in 1994 as a presenter on the popular show Locomotora. Her experience on the show gave her countless opportunities to work around musicians and even make forays into production work, learning what it meant to be on the other side of the camera. As her contact with professional musicians such as Luis Manuel Díaz, Gil Magno, and Cesar Franco continued, so did her desire to pursue her own musical expression. Putting years of networking to good use, Lú struck a deal with Universal Latino, which released her debut album, Lágrimas Cálidas, in 2006. The record's single, ""No Te Pido Flores,"" became the theme song for a popular telenovela, a sure path to record industry success. Lágrimas Cálidas achieved gold status in no time, landing singles on a variety of Billboard's Latin charts. A series of U.S. appearances later and Lú began to catch the eye of North American audiences. Already well known throughout Latin America, Lú joined the rising number of Spanish-speaking pop icons who made big waves in English-language markets (Shakira, Ricky Martin, Enrique Iglesias). ~ Evan C.
