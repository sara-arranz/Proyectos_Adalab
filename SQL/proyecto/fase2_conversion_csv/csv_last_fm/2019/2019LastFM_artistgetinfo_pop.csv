6,taylor swift,5039406,2863880718,"Taylor Alison Swift is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise.

Swift rose to mainstream prominence with her sophomore studio album, Fearless (2008), a country pop record with crossover appeal. Aided by the top-five singles “Love Story” and “You Belong with Me”, Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Swift's third studio album, Speak Now (2010), blended country pop with elements of rock and featured the top-ten singles “Mine” and “Back to December”.

Drawing inspiration from various pop, rock, and electronic genres, Swift's fourth studio album Red (2012) saw her transcending her country roots. She completely moved to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), and expanded the electropop sound on her next two studio albums, reputation (2017) and Lover (2019), which respectively embraced urban and retro styles. The four albums spawned a string of international top-five singles, including “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”, “I Knew You Were Trouble”, “Shake It Off”, “Blank Space”, “Bad Blood”, “Look What You Made Me Do”, “ME! (feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco)”, “You Need to Calm Down”, and “Lover”.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift experimented with folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums, folklore and evermore (both 2020), whose lead singles “cardigan” and “willow” topped charts around the world. She also released the critically acclaimed documentaries Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions that year. Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights (2022), marked her triumphant return to pop after two folk albums. The album set the record for biggest first day and first week ever on Spotify, spawned the hits Anti-Hero and Lavender Haze, and sold over 1.5 million copies in its first week becoming not only the biggest debut of the decade but also Swift's biggest debut ever. She would make history by becoming the first artist to occupy the entire top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 with tracks from Midnights.

Additionally, Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020 as a result of a publicized dispute with talent manager Scooter Braun and her former label Big Machine, regarding the acquisition of the masters of her back catalog. In April 2021, Swift released a re-recorded issue of her 2008 album Fearless, titled Fearless (Taylor's Version). It debuted at number one in the US. Swift continued releasing re-recorded versions of her back catalog in November, 2021 with the release of Red (Taylor's Version), a 30 track re-issue of her 2012 critical smash. The album debuted at #1 in the US, spawned the #1 hit All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From the Vault), and broke the record at the time for biggest first day for a female album on Spotify. Red (Taylor's Version) was a critical and commercial hit, and proved that Swift's ambitious, yet ongoing plan to re-record her first 6 albums was well worth it.

Along with the release of Red (Taylor's Version) came All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), Swift's filmmaking debut. The 15 minute romantic drama was based on the lyrical content from Swift's 2012 fan favorite “All Too Well” starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien. It had a limited theatrical release in major cities, and Swift held special screenings of the film throughout 2022 at various film festivals. In December, 2022 Taylor announced that she would be making her feature directorial debut with Oscar-winning studio Searchlight Pictures.

Following the release of Midnights, Swift would embark on her first tour in five years, The Eras Tour—a retrospective tour covering the entirety of her discography. During her ongoing tour, Swift would release her next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) in July and 1989 (Taylor's Version) in October of 2023. The former of which would land Swift as the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand. The latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, her largest album sales in a week span. “Is It Over Now? (Taylor's Version)”, the lead single for 1989 (Taylor's Version), would peak at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.

At the 66th annual GRAMMY Awards, Taylor Swift surprised viewers by announcing her eleventh studio album, THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT. On April 19, 2024, the album was released globally, breaking records: it became the first ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week and sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US. Swift dominated the charts, monopolizing the top 14 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 and securing the top 10 positions on Australia’s ARIA Singles Chart. The lead single, Fortnight, featuring Post Malone, quickly soared to the number-one position on the Hot 100. Additionally, just two hours after the album’s release, Swift surprised fans with a reissue titled THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY, which included 15 extra songs.

Swift has released several songs for film soundtracks. She co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack— “You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home” and “Crazier”, and contributed two songs to the Valentine's Day soundtrack, including the single “Today Was a Fairytale”, which was her first number one on the Canadian Hot 100, and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. She also contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: “Safe & Sound - from The Hunger Games Soundtrack”, co-written and recorded with The Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, and “Eyes Open”. “Safe & Sound” won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In 2013, Swift recorded “Sweeter than Fiction”, a song she wrote and produced with Jack Antonoff for the One Chance film soundtrack, which received a Best Original Song nomination at the 71st Golden Globe Awards. Swift and English singer Zayn Malik, mononymously known as Zayn, released a single together, “I Don't Wanna Live Forever”, for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). She also recorded an original song called “Beautiful Ghosts”, which she wrote with Andrew Lloyd Webber for the Cats's soundtrack (2019). In 2020, Swift's documentary Miss Americana featured the song “Only the Young” which was written after the 2018 United States elections. In 2022, she released an original song titled “Carolina” for Where The Crawdads Sing (2022) inspired by the novel written by Delia Owens.

With sales of over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is a best-selling music artist. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, including four Album of the Year wins, which makes Swift the artist with the most awards for that category in history, two Brit Awards (including a Global Icon award), an Emmy Award, 28 Guinness World Records, 32 American Music Awards (the most wins by an artist), and 23 Billboard Music Awards (the most wins by a woman). She ranked eighth on Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists Chart (2019) and was listed on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015). Swift has been included in various power rankings, such as Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2010, 2015 and 2019) and Forbes Celebrity 100 (placing first in 2016 and 2019). She was named Woman of the Decade (2010s) by Billboard, Artist of the Decade (2010s) by the American Music Awards, and Person of the Year (2023) by Time Magazine. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

9,mau y ricky,164705,2212520,"For the past few years, Mauricio and Ricky Montaner had been busy writing songs for other artists like Thalía, Miguel Bosé, Diego Boneta, Yuridia, Leslie Grace, to name a few, until recently when they decided the songs they were composing would be for their EP titled Arte under the label of Sony Music.

The young duo, Mau y Ricky, sons of music icon Ricardo Montaner, have released the album's first single, ""Voy Que Quemo,"" a song they decided best represents the music that is coming out in the LP, expected to release in July. ""After writing so many songs, it just seemed natural to start recording an album,"" Ricky, 25, tells Billboard, speaking on behalf of the duo since Mau was on vocal rest. ""We have 10 songs and an 11th that is an instrumental track. 'Voy Que Quemo' seemed like the best song to release first, and we're feeling super excited and nervous.""

Mau y Ricky partnered with Latin Grammy winner Julio Reyes Copello to produce their album and credit him for allowing them to grow artistically and teach them about following their intuition. ""We've grown as producers and songwriters, thanks to him. We also learned that the intuition of an artist is so important and it's something that needs to be respected because your intuition will differentiate you from others. We learned to write for ourselves and put out songs that will represent who we are.""

And that's exactly what Mau y Ricky did. They followed their intuition after listening to their song ""Arte"" which was almost going to be pitched to Wisin, but Ricky says, ""It didn't feel right for another artist to sing this song."" Another man they have to thank for guiding them since they started composing at a very young age is their father, who has written hit singles like ""La Cima del Cielo,"" ""Déjame Llorar"" and ""Me Va a Extrañar.""

""We've written songs together, so working with him helps you grow a lot because he's a very hard critic. Every song I've written since I was 8 years old, I'd run it by him and he'd give me feedback. He actually just heard the final product of our album and he loved it, thank God. But the best thing is that he's a fan of ours and we're huge fans of him. Yeah, he's my dad, but I'm a huge Ricardo Montaner fan.""

Besides a new album, Mau y Ricky fans can expect to see them onstage soon as they go out on tour. ""We haven't toured in such a long time because we were busy writing for others then started working on this album, but the stage is our natural habitat and where we feel most comfortable."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mau+y+Ricky"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He began as a Latin pop artist and has recorded many ballads, but has released several successful reggaeton singles. Yatra is noted for his romantic lyrics, melding traditional lyricism with modern reggaeton influences. He rose to prominence in Latin America in 2016 when he released the hit ""Traicionera"". He has released three studio albums and recorded with artists from a diverse range of musical genres throughout his career.

Born in Medellín and raised primarily in Miami, Yatra began singing at a young age and returned to Colombia to begin his musical career. He achieved breakout success with ""Traicionera"" followed by ""Robarte un Beso"" featuring Carlos Vives. ""Traicionera"" served as the lead single for his 2018 debut album, Mantra, which also featured the single ""Sutra"", featuring Puerto Rican rapper Dalmata. He then released the album Fantasia including the lead single ""Un Año"" featuring Mexican band Reik. He received continued success collaborating with Daddy Yankee, Natti Natasha, and the Jonas Brothers on the bilingual single ""Runaway"".

Yatra's music has been classified as Latin pop, reggaeton, and ballads. According to The Fader, Yatras music lands ""somewhere in between the olden times’ sappy romantics and the new wave’s sensuous vibras.""He is influenced by Latin pop and reggaeton artists Ricky Martin, J Balvin, Juanes, and Reik. In an interview with Billboard, he expressed a desire to collaborate with Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli. Yatra believes that contemporary musicians commit an ""error in associating ballads with boring and slow and old"", and hopes to rejuvenate intererest in ballads for a younger audience.However, his music contains elements of other genres; Desire Thompson of Vibe described his song ""Traicionera"" as a ""trap-EDM blend"".

Despite growing up in Florida and being fluent in English, Yatra sings almost exclusively in Spanish. Yatra explains, “My goal was always to be a singer in Spanish. And I really wanted to understand where I come from and live it. A lot of times I went to Colombia and, even though I spoke Spanish and was always speaking Spanish with my parents, I still felt like an outsider. I wasn’t 100 percent part of it. I wanted to give my roots the importance they deserve. ”His June 2019 song ""Runaway"" was his first foray into bilingual songwriting. In December 2019, he collaborated with South Korean boy group Monsta X for the song ""Magnetic"", which features verses from Yatra in Spanish and a bridge from Monsta X in Spanglish.

As a member of the British/Irish boy band One Direction, singer Harry Styles topped the charts, toured the world, and sold millions of albums before going solo in 2016. Styles was raised in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, and he made his first foray into music with a high-school band named White Eskimo. In 2010, he left home and joined the seventh season of The X Factor, where fate and Simon Cowell would eventually lead him toward a life-changing opportunity with four other young men. As One Direction, Styles and his group mates Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, and Liam Payne would release five albums from 2011 to 2015, hitting number one across the globe and selling millions of records to an adoring and rabid fan base that drew comparisons to the fervor at the height of Beatlemania. In early 2016, after Malik had already parted ways with 1D, the remaining foursome announced their indefinite hiatus.

Months later, Styles signed a solo deal with Columbia Records. Reflecting the influence of childhood favorites like Queen, Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, The Rolling Stones, Freddy Mercury, and The Beatles, Styles' solo material took a more serious and rock-based approach, while still delivering the pop sound his faithful 1D fans desired. With the help of Grammy-winning producer Jeff Bhasker (who had worked with Kanye West and Bruno Mars), Styles put together a small band and, after rehearsing the songs, headed to Jamaica for two months to record an album. ""Sign of the Times"", a plaintive ballad, was released as its first single in April 2017. The self-titled full-length album Harry Styles followed in May and debuted at the top of the Billboard 200. After two world tours, Harry set to write his sophomore album Fine Line, releasing the hit songs ""Lights Up"",  ""Watermelon Sugar"" and ""Adore You"" as the singles.

Fine Line was released on 13 December 2019 by Columbia and Erskine Records. On March 14, 2021, Harry received the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance for ""Watermelon Sugar"" at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. He was also nominated for Best Music Video with ""Adore You"" and for Best Pop Vocal Album for his ""Fine Line"" album. In May of the same year, Styles also won the Brit Award for British Single for ""Watermelon Sugar"". 

On May 20, 2022, Styles released his third studio album, titled  Harry’s House. Its promotional single ""As It Was"" went on to break world records and earn Styles the title (male) for the most-streamed track on Spotify in 24 hours. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Styles"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

18,luis fonsi,1130613,12634735,"Luis Alfonso Rodríguez López-Cepero, more commonly known as Luis Fonsi, (born April 15, 1978 in San Juan, Puerto Rico) is a Latin Grammy winning Puerto Rican singer, composer and soap opera actor.

Fonsi and his family moved to Orlando, Florida, during Fonsi's early childhood. Fonsi's childhood was relatively average for kids his age, beginning to dream about becoming a member of Menudo, arguably Latin America's most famous boy band in history, around the time he was ten years old.

Because of the air distance between his home in Orlando and Menudo's base back in Puerto Rico in particular, Fonsi was not able to achieve that particular childhood dream. He did, however, participate in many local boy bands, including one, Big Guys, where he met, and befriended, future *NSYNC member Joey Fatone. On April of that year, Fonsi had a brief return to the singing stage, when former Menudo Ray Reyes invited him and Lopez to a concert which was held at San Juan's Roberto Clemente coliseum. The press widely covered what El Vocero titled as Fonsi's moment as a Menudo, when he took the stage and joined the members of El Reencuentro to sing some of their old hits.

Fonsi's popularity has transcended ages and genres in Puerto Rico: industrialist Salvador Vassallo, for example, has told El Vocero that Fonsi is among his favorite singers.

Instead of choosing to keep a pattern of trying to find stardom in the United States with a boy band, Fonsi chose to better prepare himself for a future, stable career inside show business. He went to Florida State University to study vocal techniques. Meanwhile, he began to record demo tapes in Miami. While he was at FSU, he was overheard singing by a university music department president, who offered him a contract with a large recording company.

In 1999, Fonsi recorded his first CD, Comenzare (I Will Begin). Comenzare became an instant hit in Puerto Rico and across Latin America, with Fonsi conquering such markets as Colombia, the Dominican Republic,El Salvador, Mexico and Venezuela. His 2000 follow-up, Eterno, was equally successful. By then, Fonsi's fame had reached Europe, as he became a celebrity in Spain as well.

During 2001, a re-mix of Comenzare and Eterno was launched, while Fonsi worked on his next album, 2002's Amor Secreto. At about the same time, some media outlets such as newspapers and magazines began to comment about an allegued, adulterous romance between him and an also very famous married Puerto Rican singer, who had just happened to separate from her husband recently and bought a home near Fonsi's Orlando property. The scandal did not last too long, however, and Fonsi soon released an album in English, Fight the Feeling, also released in 2002.

Fight the Feeling did not sell well among Americans. It is expected, however, that Fonsi will sometime in the future make a second attempt at a crossover: because of the fact he has lived most of his life in Orlando, he is fluent in English as well as in Spanish.

His Fourth CD sold very well which opened new markets in Europe. ""Quien te Dijo eso?"" reached high positions on music charts. His fifth CD ""Paso a Paso"" could be said to be his disc that launched him into international markets. ""Nada es Para Siempre"" reached Number one on the music chart beating famous, Shakira.

By 2003, Fonsi began to fall in love with actress Adamari Lopez, who, as an Univision artist and fellow Puerto Rican, constantly found herself near Fonsi. That same year, Fonsi released the song Abrazar la Vida (Holding on to Life), of the album also named Abrazar la Vida. The song, perhaps ironically and because of a particular circumstance, would later become one of Lopez's favorite songs. While Fight the Feeling was released by the MCA label, Abrazar la Vida was released by Universal's Spanish music label. Fonsi also recorded Amazing in 2003, a duet with Emma Bunton for her 2004 album Free Me.

Fonsi took off 2004, a year when rumors were reported by magazines, television news shows and newspapers that he and Lopez had committed to marry each other. During 2005, Fonsi was in the middle of an international tour that would have had him away from home for many months; the tour was abruptly cancelled when Lopez was diagnosed with cancer. Fonsi promised her to stay by her side, and has travelled with her back and forth between Mexico, Miami and Puerto Rico for various treatment and work related trips.

On June 3, 2006, Fonsi and Adamari Lopez were married in a religious ceremony in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico attended by many celebrities including Joey Fatone, Charytin, Ednita Nazario, and Carlos Ponce and his brother, aspiring Spanish-language singer Jean Rodriguez, who goes simply by Jean as his professional name. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Luis+Fonsi"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Known for his variegated vocals, Malone has gained acclaim for blending genres and subgenres of hip-hop, pop, R&B, and trap. His stage name was derived from inputting his birth name into a rap name generator

Malone began his music career in 2011 and gained recognition with his 2015 debut single ""White Iverson"", which peaked at number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Malone signed a recording contract with Republic Records and released his debut album Stoney; it contained the diamond single ""Congratulations"" (featuring Quavo) and set the record for most weeks (77) on the US Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

Austin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York. He was raised by his father, Richard Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip-hop, country, and rock. When Malone was nine years old, he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys. Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game Guitar Hero.

Malone has always had a love for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event. According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band. He says soon afterward he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip-hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.

According to Malone, he chose ""Post Malone"" as his stage name when he was 14 or 15. The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone, but Malone later explained that ""Post"" is his last name, and he used a ""rap name generator"" to get ""Malone"". At 16, using the audio editor Audacity, Malone created his first mixtape, Young and After Them Riches. He showed it to some of his classmates at Grapevine High School. He was voted ""Most Likely to Become Famous"" by his classmates as a senior in high school. He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.

Malone later enrolled in Tarrant County College but dropped out. After leaving college, Malone moved to Los Angeles, California, with his longtime friend Jason Probst, a professional game streamer.

After moving to Los Angeles, Malone, Probst, and several other producers and artists formed the music group BLCKVRD and recorded music together. Several members of the group, including Malone, moved into a house in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley together. While living in the San Fernando Valley, Malone met record producers FKi 1st and Sauce Lord Rich, who formed the production team FKi, as well as Rex Kudo, who produced several of Malone's tracks, including ""White Iverson"". Malone recorded the song two days after writing it. The lyrics of ""White Iverson"" allude to Basketball Hall of Fame player Allen Iverson. In February 2015, upon completion, it was uploaded to Malone's SoundCloud account. On July 19, 2015, Malone released a music video for ""White Iverson"".

After hitting one million views within a month of releasing ""White Iverson"", Malone quickly garnered attention from record labels. In August 2015, he signed a recording contract with Republic Records. Malone went on to work with a number of prominent rappers including 50 Cent, Young Thug, Kanye West, and others. In August 2015, he performed at Kylie Jenner's 18th birthday party, where he met Kanye West, who enjoyed his music, leading to him collaborating with Malone on his single ""Fade"" from his album The Life of Pablo.

On April 20, 2016, Malone premiered his new single, ""Go Flex"" on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show.

In June 2016, XXL editor-in-chief Vanessa Satten revealed Malone was considered for XXL's ""2016 Freshman Class"" magazine cover, but she was ""told by his camp that he wasn't paying attention to hip hop so much. He was going in more of a rock/pop/country direction."" However, Malone denied these claims, explaining that his latest mixtape, as well as his album, were both hip-hop. In August 2016, Malone issued an apology for his album, Stoney, being late. It was available for pre-order on November 4 and was finally released on December 9. Malone later went on to call the album ""mediocre"", despite the success of the single ""Congratulations"" featuring Quavo, Malone's first top-ten song on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number eight.

He is one of the most well known reggaeton artists in Latin America. His cross over success in the U.S. has given him more exposure to English speaking Reggaeton fans, making him one of the more recognizable faces of Reggaeton along with Daddy Yankee and Tego Calderón. Don Omar's popularity is currently rising and he recently appeared on MTV. Omar is best known for his songs ""Dile"" and ""Dale Don Dale"" from his first album The Last Don and ""Reggaeton Latino"".

25,natti natasha,306506,4359458,"Natalia Alexandra Gutiérrez, known by her stage name Natti Natasha, is a Dominican reggaeton singer, songwriter, and actress. Hailing from Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Natasha grew up surrounded by endless musical influences and enrolled in Santiago’s School of Fine Arts at the age of seven where she developed her singing abilities, describing her time at the school as “one of the best of her life.” Her studio experience would begin as a teenager when she would record songs as a hobby and later alongside friends.

This all led up to her decision to make the biggest and riskiest move of her life, and that was to move to the United States. She settled in the Bronx, New York, or “the City of the Dreams and Dreamers” for young, aspiring musicians like her at the time. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Natti called the move “one of the craziest moves anyone ever did in her family,” and that she often looks back at the decision and wonders what she was doing. Natti would hop from studio to studio, working without pay, but to her, this was a way to get her name out there. A producer friend from Santiago would soon step in and lend her his New York studio.

Natti’s first-ever break came when icon Don Omar signed her to his record label, the Orfanato Music Group, and the pair would go on to make history for years to come. Their collaborations “Dutty Love,” “Tus Movimientos,” “Perdido en tus Ojos,” and a “Hold Ya” remix with Gyptian made waves across Latin America and introduced the world to future reggaeton royalty. Her debut project, an EP titled “All About Me” was released on March 28, 2012.

Natti would continue to make big career moves throughout the years including her departure from Don Omar’s record label and signing onto Pina Records in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2017 when her big breakout would come once and for all. Not only did she record and release a collaboration titled “Otra Cosa” alongside the legendary Daddy Yankee, but she also released what was arguably the biggest song of 2017. “Criminal” featuring Ozuna became an instant hit upon its release, the music video amassing over 1 billion views in just five months and becoming the most watched music video by a female singer released that year.

2019 saw the release of her much-anticipated debut album, “ilumiNATTI,” on February 15. 15 tracks made up the project with two collaborations in total, “Te Lo Dije'' with Anitta and “Soy Mía” with Kany García.

30,mark ronson,2648808,42218498,"Mark Ronson  (born 4 September 1975) is a sought-after producer, who's worked with such diverse artists as Miley Cyrus, Jay-Z, Lily Allen, Robbie Williams, Bruno Mars, Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Duran Duran and comedian Jimmy Fallon. 

Born in London, he is the son of writer Ann Dexter-Jones and real estate tycoon Laurence Ronson. His mother later married Mick Jones, lead guitarist of multiplatinum selling rock band Foreigner. He has two sisters: fashion designer Charlotte Ronson and DJ Samantha Ronson. He spent his childhood in a wealthy suburb of London where he lived on the same street as Paul McCartney‘s family. When his parents divorced at age 8, he moved to New York, where he made friends with John Lennon's son, Sean Lennon.

Ronson played guitar and drums from an early age, but it wasn't until moving to New York City with his mother that Ronson discovered DJ culture. At age 16, already a fan of such popular hip-hop artists as Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys, Ronson began listening to the various hip-hop mixtapes released every few months by DJs. Inspired, Ronson confiscated his father's record collection and began trying his hand at mixing. 

The young DJ with the diverse taste soon caught the ears and eyes of various socialites and New York celebrities, including fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger, who featured Ronson along with other sons and daughters of celebrities in a 1997 fashion campaign. A year later, hip-hop mogul Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs hired Ronson to DJ his fabled 29th birthday bash. These and other high-profile gigs boosted Ronson's ""hip quotient"" and helped promote his more serious-minded music career. Fusing his eclectic turntable skills with his knowledge of musical instruments and songwriting, Ronson eventually embarked on his first solo project. Featuring such diverse guest artists as dancehall rapper Sean Paul, hip-hop artist Mos Def, Jack White of the White Stripes, and Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, Ronson's debut album, Here Comes the Fuzz, bowed for Elektra in 2003.

Ronson's second album, Version, adds to his eclectic style. In this sophomore album, Ronson fuses a range of musical genres from Daniel Merriweather to Ol' Dirty Bastard to Phantom Planet with an up tempo contemporary funk sound. All the songs on this album are covers of previous Billboard top-10 pop songs, with a jazzy twist.

Career

Attending Vassar College and then New York University (NYU), Ronson became a regular at downtown hip-hop spots and made his name as a DJ on the New York club scene in 1993. He was soon one of the most respected DJs and was being called on for celebrities' private parties. Ronson is known for his diverse, genre-spanning selection, influenced by both the hip-hop scene of New York and the more rock influence of the UK, amongst others.

He moved on, however, to producing music. After producing Nikka Costa's song ""Everybody Got Their Something,"" Ronson signed a record contract with Elektra Records. His first album Here Comes the Fuzz was released in 2003 and was a critically acclaimed success that featured artists of all genres, despite initially poor sales. The most well known song from the album, "" Ooh Wee"" samples "" Sunny"" by Boney M and features Nate Dogg, Ghostface Killah, and Trife Da God. He has since produced multiple songs on the albums of singers Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse, Lily Allen, and Robbie Williams.

In 2004, he formed his own record label, Allido Records, a subsidiary of Sony BMG's J Records, along with his longtime manager Rich Kleiman. The first artist he signed to Allido was rapper Rhymefest, most well-known for winning the Grammy for co-writing Kanye West's ""Jesus Walks"".

In March 2006, Ronson released a cover of Radiohead's "" Just"" as a single. In certain areas, such as the UK, it gained major radio play. It also saw release as part of Exit Music: Songs with Radio Heads, a full Radiohead covers CD, in April, later appearing on Ronson's second album, Version, which was released in the UK on 16 April 2007. It includes other covers of a diverse selection of rock & pop songs including: Kaiser Chiefs' "" Oh My God"" (featuring guest vocals from Lily Allen), an instrumental version of Coldplay's "" God Put A Smile Upon Your Face"", Britney Spears' ""Toxic"", Ryan Adams' ""Amy"", Maxïmo Park's "" Apply Some Pressure"", The Zutons' ""Valerie"" and Kasabian's ""L.S.F."".

32,el arrebato,55932,466881,"Javier Labandón, más conocido por su nombre artístico El Arrebato, es un cantautor español de rumba-pop y flamenco.

Comenzó su carrera artística sobre 1985 y su carrera discográfica en 1988 sacando su primer disco con el grupo Piel morena en el que le acompañaban 2 grandes amigos de su Sevilla natal . Con ellos cosechó sus primeros éxitos hasta el 8 de septiembre de 1998, cuando Piel Morena se disolvió definitivamente tras varios cambios en la formación.

Gracias a que Piel Morena y Camela estaban en la misma discográfica (Ar Producciones), El Arrebato conoció a Dioni Martín, uno de los integrantes de Camela con el cual forjó una gran amistad.

Cuando Piel Morena se disolvió, El Arrebato mandó una maqueta a Dioni, éste se la envió a su discográfica, EMI, la cual apostó por él y decidió grabar lo que sería el primer disco de El Arrebato: Poquito a poco, con el que logró un éxito muy superior al que había tenido con Piel Morena y mucho mayor del que él mismo esperaba.

Actualmente se encuentra promocionando su último trabajo: Lo que el viento me dejó que salió a la venta el 7 de septiembre de 2010.

Lo que el viento me dejó es el sexto álbum de estudio de El Arrebato y mantiene en la cumbre una impecable carrera que comenzó con Poquito a poco (2001) para continuar con Una noche con arte (2003), Que salga el sol por donde quiera (2004), Un cuartito pa mis cosas (2006) y Mundología (2008), a los que hay que añadir un Grandes éxitos publicado en 2006.

Son álbumes que han conseguido multiplatinos, elegidos por votación popular en TVE Mejor Disco del Año (Que salga el sol por donde quiera) y que han situado a El Arrebato como uno de los grandes de la música española por su capacidad de conectar con el latido de la calle. El Himno Oficial del Centenario del Sevilla se ha convertido en un emblema, en un ejemplo más de su alcance popular y de su inspiración para unir generaciones.


En estos ocho años, El Arrebato ha lanzado canciones como Duele, Ojú lo que la quiero, Hoy me dio por ser honesto, Poquito a poco, Ve despacito, Háblame del sur, A mí na’ ma’, Búscate un hombre que te quiera, Por un beso de tu boca, Un amor tan grande, Una noche con arte, No puedo más, Dame cariño, Hoy todo va a salirme bien, Mirando pa ti... Son temas que se han incrustado en la memoria popular a los que ahora se une No lo entiendo, el primer single de su nuevo álbum Lo que el viento me dejó que se publica el 7 de septiembre.

Célebre es su declaración:

“Ser sevillista es algo tan importante para mí como otras tradiciones sevillanas.”

Growing up in a Spanish-speaking environment (born to a Cuban mother and Mexican father), she fostered her love of music by listening to Celia Cruz and Alejandro Fernández. At the age of 15, she auditioned for The X Factor in Greensboro, North Carolina. Even though she was eliminated (along with her four future groupmates), Simon Cowell recognized her talent and combined the girls to form the quintet girl group Fifth Harmony.

Despite finishing in third place, they went on to be the most successful contestants from that season.

She gained some significant attention with her early releases, but it was her 2019 sophomore effort, Hot Pink, that took her to the top of the Hot 100. Subsequent charting singles and collaborations with SZA and Saweetie further solidified her star power, and made the arrival of her 2021 album Planet Her all the more hotly anticipated.

Singles followed, including her savvy 2022 cover of Hole's ""Celebrity Skin"" 2022's ""Vegas"" off the Elvis soundtrack, and 2023's trip-hop-inflected ""Attention"" all of which spotlighted Doja's adventurous, genre-crossing sensibilities. The latter track and ""Paint the Town Red"" appeared on her fourth album, 2023's Scarlet, which found her digging deep into her rap and hip-hop roots and became her third consecutive album to hit the Top Ten of the Billboard 200.

48,aventura,806198,16766409,"From their roots as a Bronx-based boy band fusing bachata with hip-hop, R&B, and pop, Aventura have becme one of the most influential Latin groups of all time. Their primary signature comprises inimitable, elegant, four-part harmonies, earworm melodic hooks, and rhythmic imagination. Beginning with 2005's ""Ella y Yo"" (feat. Don Omar) they placed numerous singles inside the Top Ten, including the chart-toppers ""Por un Segundo"" and ""Dile al Amor."" Further, nine of their albums charted, including 2009's pop crossover The Last, which topped the list, as did its live follow-up, 2011's 14 +14. They have won countless Premio Lo Nuestro, Premio Juventud, and Billboard Music awards. After taking a multi-year hiatus in 2011, they returned in 2014 as part of Romeo's sold-out Yankee Stadium concert, and in 2016 played sold-out shows across Latin America, Europe, and the United States. In 2019 they issued the single ""Inmortal"" as the final chart-topping track on Romeo's Utopia album and later performed it live with him at MetLife Stadium. In 2021, Aventura teamed with Bad Bunny on the chart-topping single ""Volví."" The quartet released the single ""Brindo con Agua"" in 2024.

The group was formed in 1994 in the Bronx by four boys of Dominican heritage (Anthony ""Romeo"" Santos, Lenny Santos, Max Santos, and Henry Santos Jeter) determined to break bachata music into the pop mainstream by fusing it with sounds they heard every day on the radio, including hip-hop and R&B. Unlike other young acts seeking success, they didn't hand themselves over to a producer who would mold their image and sound. Instead, they proceeded to learn skills needed to succeed, from production and arrangement to songwriting and playing instruments. 

After years playing parties and local festivals, they caught a break and signed to BMG. They released their debut long-player, Generation Next, with the assistance of an outside producer (at the label's insistence). The group insisted on writing their own material, and they successfully resisted the label's attempt to turn them into a cookie-cutter boy band in the style of the Backstreet Boys or *NSYNC by ensuring bachata remained dominant in all their songs. Unfortunately, the album fell between the cracks of both the burgeoning Latin movement and the pop/R&B chart-toppers.

After touring regionally, opening for other acts, and playing their own shows across the East Coast, they released We Broke the Rules, a blueprint that showcased their mature style. The album title proved prescient as Romeo penned lyrics outside the subjects of romance and heartbreak, and Max's guitar work strayed from the classic, clean bachata lead and rhythmic styles by employing all manner of electronics and effects. Further, Lenny was the first to incorporate funky slap bass and chordal rock riffs into bachata. ""Obsesión,"" the set's first single, became a hit with Latin audiences, finding a strong crossover into hip-hop. The album peaked at number 56 on the Top Latin Albums list. 

While growing a North American audience, they also became popular in Europe, thanks to frequent touring. In 2003, they returned with Love & Hate, which saw them experimenting even further with their sound, adding merengue into the mix and upping the R&B/hip-hop quotient without losing touch with their background, singing in Spanish, English, and Spanglish. The set reached number 66 at Top Latin Albums. These releases, promising and adventurous as they were, were a prologue to 2005's God's Project. Widely regarded as the group's best album to date, it went all the way to number five on the Latin albums list and netted the chart-topping single ""Ella y Yo"" (feat. Don Omar); they followed with the two-CD/one-DVD set K.O.B.: Live. 

By 2007, Aventura were one of the biggest Latin groups in the world. They became the first bachata group to sell out Madison Square Garden in the round. Later that year they released Kings of Bachata: Sold Out at Madison Square Garden featuring guest performances from Miri Ben-Ari, Wisin & Yandel, and Don Omar. It topped the Tropical and Latin albums charts and placed inside the top half of the Top 200. That same year, they also took home two Lo Nuestro awards and three Billboard Music Awards. 

These successes set the table for their fifth studio outing, 2009's The Last. The best-selling set featured guest appearances from Wyclef Jean, Ludacris, Akon, and Wisin y Yandel. It netted six charting singles including the number ones ""Dime el Amor"" and ""El Malo."" The Last became the top-selling Latin album of 2009 and 2010. It spent 23 weeks at number one on the Latin Billboard chart and peaked at number five in the Top 200. Two years later, the audio-video set 14 Plus 14 arrived, featuring 14 of the group's greatest hits along with their accompanying videos. It was a swan song, and they went on hiatus in 2011 to pursue other projects. Romeo and Henry Santos both engaged in successful solo careers while Lenny and Max formed Grupo Vena.

Aventura unofficially reunited in 2014 when they performed together during Romeo's sold-out Yankee Stadium concert. They officially reunited a year later by announcing a month-long series of concerts at the United Palace Theater in New York. These took place in early 2016. That year, the band's compilation Todavía Me Amas: Lo Mejor De Aventura, peaked at number one on the Tropical albums chart. 

In April 2019 Aventura released the single and music video ""Inmortal,"" as part of Santos's fourth studio album, Utopia. It debuted at number five at Hot Latin Songs, and at number 95 on the Hot 100. Aventura won Tropical Duo/Group of the Year at the Billboard Latin Music Awards and performed ""Inmortal"" alongside Raulin Rodriguez. They also performed during Romeo's Utopia concert at the MetLife Stadium, offering ""Dile al Amor,"" ""Todavia Me Amas,"" and ""Inmortal"" (The latter, issued as a single, peaked at number one, spending 18 weeks on the Hot 100.) In December, Aventura announced the La Gira Inmortal tour, their first in a decade. It kicked off in February of 2020, but after only ten shows they were forced off the road by the COVID-19 pandemic that canceled live music all over the world. 

In August 2021, Aventura surprised fans with the release of the single and video for ""Volvi"" in collaboration with Bad Bunny. It topped the Hot Latin Songs charts and the video racked up 250 million views during its first two weeks. The quartet returned in 2024 with the single ""Brindo con Agua."" ~ Chris Nickson & Thom Jurek <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Aventura"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

59,dua lipa,2744595,261424605,"Dua Lipa (born August 22, 1995) is an English-Albanian singer-songwriter. She was born in London of refugee parents from the Republic of Kosovo, growing up between both countries until fully moving back to London at age 15.

Dua Lipa began to write her name in the music industry. Lipa gained attention from the specialized media as an artist after the release of her debut album in 2017,  ""Dua Lipa"" (self-titled). It won the third position on the UK Albums Chart and featured eight singles. ""New Rules""  and ""IDGAF"" have become global hits, reaching the number 1 position in countries such as Australia, Belgium, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, as well as reaching the top ten positions in more than 30 countries, including the USA for ""New Rules"" . The album featured the hits ""One Kiss"" with Calvin Harris, ""Be The One"", ""Scared To Be Lonely"" with Martin Garrix, ""No Lie"" with Sean Paul and many others.  It later received 5 nominations at the BRITs Awards, the most important British awards ceremony in music. She also won with her debut album two Grammys, ""Best Dance Recording"" for her song ""Electricity"" with Silk City, and moreover the ""Best New Artist"" award. ""Dua Lipa"" (self-titled) is the most streamed female album of all-time on Spotify.

But Lipa's great success would even come in her second album ""Future Nostalgia"", which made the promising young woman a true pillar of world pop music. Having hits such as ""Don't Start Now"", ""Break My Heart"" and ""Levitating"" , the album is currently the most played female album of the 2020's decade on Spotify and secured a Grammy at the 2021 ceremony for ""Best Pop Vocal Album"" and was present among the nominations for ""Album of the Year"". It also won the Brit Award for ""Album of the Year"". ""Future Nostalgia"" is the 2nd most streamed female album of all-time on Spotify. ""Don't Start Now"" became her most streamed hit on Spotify, nominated for ""Record of the Year"" at the Grammys. It was the biggest female song of the year 2020.

The British phenomenon has captured an all-time record on the Billboard Hot 100, all thanks to the success of ""Levitating"". The track became the longest-charting female song on the chart, with 77 weeks, being the 4th song overall to reach this astonishing feat. The same track became the biggest hit of 2021 in the United States and globally without ever reaching #1, proving once and for all that the disputed #1 position on the Billboard Hot 100, that she still doesn't have reached, doesn't define the success of an artist. For Lipa, it seems that longevity is more important than an instant success.

Her song, ""Cold Heart""  with  Elton John and  PNAU, was one of the biggest hits of 2022. She had during that year a sold-out global stadium and arena tour with ""The Future Nostalgia Tour"", marking her as a definitive icon of the beginning of the 2020's decade, especially in the European continent, her main music market.

She began her third album cycle in 2024, while also making her acting debut that year with ""Barbie"" and ""Argylle"" in 2024. Her third album, ""Radical Optimism,"" was released on May 3rd, 2024. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Dua+Lipa"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

62,topic,476433,5351312,"There are several artists with the name Topic.

1. Tobias Topic (born March 23, 1992) is a Croatian-German DJ, producer and musician. In 2008, he started using Logic Studio, a digital audio workstation, to produce music with the guidance of a teacher. He started his musical career on social media with the assistance of YouTube musicians who contacted him.

Topic's first release, a house song called ""Light It Up"", was released at the end of 2014 and reached more than one million views on his YouTube channel. In summer 2015, he released his debut album Miles. In 2019, he released his single ""Breaking Me"", featuring Swedish singer A7S. The single reached the top 10 positions in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, and Ireland.

In October 2020, the single reached 500 million streams on Spotify and over one billion streams overall.



2. Life for ‘Topic’ began in West LA and evolved in West Covina throughout his adolescent years. The Yin and Yang lifestyle of religious based principles instilled by his mother and hard knock life experiences learned from his father laid the foundation on which this universal rap artist was formed.

Extremely confident in his ability to write or rap about anything, hence the evolution of the epithet “Topic’. No literary form of expression can exist without a ‘Topic’. Having a true love for music since the early days of his youth, Topic began singing and writing his own lyrics in grade school. By the summer of 8th grade writing his first rhyme created a natural euphoria for the lyricist, and an addiction for which there is no cure, only temporary relief. In 1993, Topic had his first experience in a professional recording studio. He took advantage of the opportunity and learned all he could about the mechanics behind the development of a song.

An innate passion for writing combined with being outspoken and a natural leader, this lyricist is certain to accomplish what he wants. What he wants is to share his truth on different points of discussion by expressing them in his lyrics. There is truly no fear emanating from this man when a pen is in hand. In love with the lyrics that flow from his soul he stirs up the game on a mental level while stimulating your desire to move to the beat.

Along with staying modest, balancing confidence with humility and driven by a passion to spit the truth, Topic began performing in local clubs, competitions and underground spots throughout LA, the Inland Empire, and West Covina. The development of his own company BOSS (Business Over Stupid Shit) Life World Inc. is a testament to the prodigious potential the artist possesses.

Topic has endured a series of tribulations synonymous with the testing of Job. His lyrical schemes reflect the influence of his life experiences as well as those around him. Marrying his strengths, insecurities and weaknesses with the melodic element of hip-hop, it is ingenious the way he brings the truth so uninhibited it exposes the very soul of the man.

The Boss of it all with a canvas of soul felt, epic beats of street life and hard-core hustle make it difficult for you to ignore the formidable hip-hop rap artist. Possessing all attributes of a West Coast gangster but the demeanor of a true businessman, this prolific rapper honed his skills and landed a record deal with SRC Universal through the independent label Drama Family.

Previously working with “WC” of Westside Connection, Knocturnal, and Shanta formerly of Aftermath, also alongside producers such as; Johnathan “JR” Rotem, Cool and Dre, Jelly Roll, and Neff-u who has production credits for almost every music genre, and artist from Dr. Dre to U2. Now label mates with such artists as the world renowned multi-platinum selling Akon and David Banner, Topic will soon accomplish his mission to make a predominant impact in the Industry.

‘Topic’ can be defined as complex but not complicated, simplistic but by no means simple. Ardently motivated by success and God’s timing the intimate, hard-hitting songs written by this artist are sure to induce an encore. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Topic"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Never having been on a stage before, he headed to South by Southwest in the spring of 2015. Kirk changed his name to DaBaby, going so far as to explain the ""political reasons"" for this decision in the lyrics to ""DaBaby (Intro),"" a short introduction to 2016's God's Work Resurrected, his first mixtape under the new moniker.

The Papua New Guinean born singer has emerged at the very forefront of the music scene throughout the islands and beyond. His charm and charisma have captured the hearts and minds of scores of adoring fans, and his beloved songs have become household favourites time and time again. Justin's unique style and sound is an irresistible blend of pop, reggae, R&B, dancehall and island music. His music is of course heavily stemmed from his diverse musical influences, but it is also undoubtedly a result of his life experiences in his home nation Papua New Guinea, and also from many years of living, travelling and performing abroad in North America, the South Pacific and South-East Asia.

After the staggering success of Justin's debut album ""Much Love"" (2005), which produced the dance floor favourite ""I Wanna Give You Some Lovin'"" and the Pacific-wide anthem ""Much Love"", his follow-up album ""JW"" (2008) was no less impressive adding to his repertoire the sentimental ballad favourite ""In Love With U"" and the silky smooth, dancehall laced ""Fire"" - both multi-national no.1 smash hits. The expectations were high for Justin to come back strongly and reproduce the magic that he captured on his first two albums, and now after a long wait and much anticipation Justin's latest album, ""Reign of Morobe"", has finally arrived and is already proving to be his finest work to date.

Critics have labelled ""Reign of Morobe"" a ""musical masterpiece"". It features the tracks: ""Runaway"" - a fun and infectious zouk/reggaeton number about a weekend escapade, and a certified number one in several countries; ""Island Girl"" - a work of genius and a radio number one in New Zealand, this song is an incredible reworking of the classic 1950's ballads that many music listeners still cherish so dearly today; ""Your Love"" (feat. Sharzy) is an emotional and heartfelt tribute to Justin's grandmother, his lifelong hero and mentor; and the title track ""Rain of Morobe"" - featuring internationally acclaimed PNG artist O-shen. ""Rain of Morobe"" is a high energy dance track that tells the story of the torrential rains and storms that are commonplace in the Papua New Guinean province of Morobe, the place that both Justin and O-shen call home.

In ""Reign of Morobe"" listeners will witness the ever evolving talent and innovation that they have come to expect and appreciate from JW. It's unveiling is a landmark moment in Justin's successful and ongoing legacy. With hit after hit after hit, this album epitomises the term ""all killer, no filler"", and it is sure to have listeners dancing, reminiscing and rejoicing for years to come. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Wellington"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Rudimental are an east London (UK) music quartet, comprising the songwriters and producers Piers Agget, Kesi Dryden and Amir Amor, together with DJ Locksmith. 

They have stated that they are on a mission to bring back soul into electronic music, and are quoted as saying: “We aren’t just electronic bedroom producers, and we’re not just guitarists and pianists who don’t know much about making a beat”.  They grew up on everything from grime to jazz and blues, from hip-hop to house, and state: “You can’t really box us into a category, we’re more about musicality, songwriting and broader influences. We are Sly and the Family Stone, Todd Edwards and Dr. Dre in a cheeseburger!”

The original Rudimental trio go back a long way. Piers and Locksmith grew up on the same road in Hackney, with Kesi living just around the corner in Stoke Newington, where he went to the same school as Labrinth and Professor Green.  Amir joined the collective in mid-2011 after working with them on some remixes.

Early life
Drake attended both Forest Hill Collegiate Institute (left) and Vaughan Road Academy (right) during high school.
Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practicing Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Drake's mother, Sandra ""Sandi"" Graham (née Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. His parents met after Dennis performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he first interacted with Sandra, who was in attendance. He is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day school, and formally celebrated becoming a Bar Mitzvah in a religious service.

Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Dennis' limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the United States until Drake's early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, however, Dennis would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer. His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song titled ""Drake's Dad"". Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell records, which Drake vehemently denies.

Drake was raised in two Toronto neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end until grade six, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighborhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move, Drake replied, ""[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement; my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.""

He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school. He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighborhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighborhood, Drake described the school as ""not by any means the easiest school to go to."" Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background, and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school. He later graduated in October 2012.

Career - 2001–2005: Degrassi: The Next Generation
At 15, eager to begin as an actor, a high school friend introduced Drake to his father, who was an acting agent. The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks a basketball star who became physically disabled after a classmate shot him. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, ""My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV"". He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, returning for sporadic appearances until his character graduated from school. Overall, Drake appeared in a total of 145 episodes.

2006–2009: Early mixtapes and So Far Gone
Lil Wayne, the founder of Young Money Entertainment, would sign Drake to the label in 2009.
After becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as ""pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it."" The mixtape was released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies. In 2007, he released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single ""Replacement Girl"", featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever-unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with ""Replacement Girl"" being featured on the channel's ""New Joint of the Day"" segment on April 30, 2007. The song also saw Drake sample ""Man of the Year"" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including ""Ransom"", ""Forever"", and a remix to ""Brand New"". Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.

In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles ""Best I Ever Had"" and ""Successful"", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs ""I'm Goin' In"" and ""Fear"". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.

Due to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as ""one of the biggest bidding wars ever"". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album titled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means.

Drake then joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of ""Best I Ever Had"" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He underwent surgery later that year.

2010–2012: Thank Me Later and Take Care
Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.

On March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single ""Over"", which peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, ""Find Your Love"", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[76] The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, ""]Care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image]."" The third single and fourth singles, ""Miss Me"" and ""Fancy"" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.

Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.

It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire on May 8, and he had also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.

Beginning his second effort in fall 2010, Drake announced his intentions to allow for Noah ""40"" Shebib to handle most of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me Later, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and others. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be Take Care. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, ""I didn't get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed many of the songs and sonically I didn't get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round."" Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.

In January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie, to focus on the album. ""Dreams Money Can Buy"" and ""Marvins Room"" were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track listing, while ""Marvins Room"" gained Gold certification by the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio. Drake would soon release the song's music video on June 28.

""Headlines"" was released on August 9, acting as the lead single for Take Care. It was met with positive critical and commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12. It was eventually certified Platinum in both the United States and Canada. The music video for the single was released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game in January 2012. ""Make Me Proud"" was released as the album's second single, on October 16. It was the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number nine the following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88. ""Make Me Proud"" soon became Drake's fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.

Prior to the album's release, Drake had planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne, however, it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne. He had also begun collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled Y.O.L.O., but the duo decided against the project, in favor of increased concern for their respective studio albums.

Take Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. John McDonnell of NME dubbed it ""an affecting masterpiece"" and commended its ""delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive lyrics."" Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal found Drake's ""technical abilities"" to be improved and stated, ""Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up."" Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice called it ""a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West."" Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented the depth of Drake's ""moral psychodramas"" and stated, ""the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying power."" It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial success, eventually being certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the US.

The album's third and fourth singles, ""The Motto"" and Take Care"", were released on November 29, and February 21, 2012 respectively. Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with ""The Motto"" credited for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States. The music video for ""Take Care"" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, ""None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] - make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it."" The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year. The song was also featured on the channel's ""Pop Songs You Must Hear"" list of 2011. ""HYFR"" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified Gold. It would later win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video in 2012, and the channel also ranked him at number two on their ""Hottest MCs in the Game"" list.

In promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip-hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million. He then returned to acting, starring in Ice Age: Continental Drift as Ethan.

2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and commercial mixtapes
During the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer's influence over his next album. Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics prevalent previously.

In January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off of his third album at the conclusion of the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of his third album. The album's second single, ""Hold On, We're Going Home"", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful single off of the album, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song's music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the video. Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing the album's third single, ""Too Much"", alongside featured artist Sampha.

Nothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favorable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in 808s & Heartbreak. The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further promoted by the ""Would You like a Tour?"" throughout late 2013, to early 2014. It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million. Drake then returned to acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night Live, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what ""kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters"". Drake also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city. In late 2014, Drake announced that he had begun recording sessions for his fourth studio album.

In 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the Romeo Santos song Odio. He also appeared on a remix of Tuesday by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard's Rhythmic chart and number twelve on the ""Hot 100"", and released ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"" as a non-album single. The latter went double platinum in the United States.

On February 12, 2015, Drake released If You're Reading This It's Too Late onto iTunes, with no prior announcement. Despite debate on whether it is an album or a mixtape, its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money Records, a scheme that was rumored to allow Drake to leave the label. However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and If You're Reading This It's Too Late sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall. Drake proceeded If You're Reading This It's Too Late with a collaborative mixtape with Future, which was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week.

What a Time to Be Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Drake the first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the same year since 2004. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units. Drake also appeared on the cover of The Fader for their 100th issue.

2016–2017: Views and More Life
Drake announced in January 2016 that his fourth studio album would be launched during the spring, releasing the promotional single ""Summer Sixteen"" later that month. The album was originally titled Views from the six, but would later be shortened to Views. ""Summer Sixteen"" debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip-hop to more tenured artists. This move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as ""goodly brash"" or ""conventionally disrespectful."" It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake popularizing the term ""The Six"" when referencing Toronto. Drake also crashed a Bat Mitzvah in New York City on February 20, performing at the event.

Drake soon released the album's lead singles, ""Pop Style"" and the dancehall-infused ""One Dance"", on April 5. Both debuted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with ""One Dance"" becoming Drake's first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist. The single also became Drake's first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed the album's release date of April 29, and followed it up with various promotional videos. On October 15, ""One Dance"" became Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016.

Views was previewed in London, before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being made available to various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later to release a short film titled Please Forgive Me, starring frequent collaborators, Swedish twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta. As of 2019, Views remains Drake's best-selling album.

Drake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as the show's musical guest. Later, Drake was named as a member of the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury. During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the music video for ""Child's Play"" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics. On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views. At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Drake received the most nominations, with 10, winning the awards for Album of the Year and Best Hip-Hop Video. Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the course of the tour in Europe. Seven additional dates were added a day later due to overwhelming demands.

Soon after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed he would be releasing a project titled More Life in December, however he later pushed the date back to the new year. The project was described as a ""playlist of original music"", rather than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album. He was later revealed to be Spotify's most streamed artist for the second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion streams for all projects on the service, which is more than double the amount of streams he had in 2015. Drake later secured his second and third Grammy Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony. Despite multiple setbacks, Drake announced More Life would be released on March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials released through Instagram. Upon release, More Life received mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200, earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It also set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever streamed album in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music alone. The album also garnered 61.3 million streams on Spotify, dethroning Ed Sheeran's ÷ as the highest opening on the service in a single day. He later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins in a single show. Billboard also reported Drake had been present on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has the most recorded entries by a solo artist.

He then released the single ""Signs"" on June 24, as well as reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset. The singles marked his first releases since More Life, with ""Signs"" was initially released as a collaboration between Drake and French fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the ""Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2018"" fashion show. The event also had a playlist exclusively from OVO Sound, curated by label co-founder Oliver El-Khatib. Drake later hosted the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of Virginia Black. Drake then appeared in The Carter Effect documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince Carter, who was the first superstar player to appear for the Toronto Raptors since the franchise's inception in 1995. The documentary also featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and LeBron James.

2018: Scorpion and return to television
After rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer Pi'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017. Two songs would later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on January 20, 2018, marking Drake's first solo release since More Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring on a remix of the Jay-Z song ""Family Feud"" with Lil Wayne, as the lead single of the latter's Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape. Scary Hours featured the songs ""Diplomatic Immunity"" and ""God's Plan"", which both debuted within the top-ten, with the latter eventually breaking various streaming records as it debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was Drake's second as a solo artist to reach number one.

Drake earned his 70th top 40 hit after featuring on the Migos song ""Walk It Talk It"", which debuted at number eighteen, and peaked at number ten. He later featured on BlocBoy JB's debut single, ""Look Alive"", which was released on February 9, 2018. The song's entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper with the top 10 hits on the Hot 100, with 23. He then featured on a remix to ""Lemon"", a song originally released as collaboration between band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, Drake announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was releasing a single later that night. On April 6, ""Nice for What"" was released, alongside a music video, which featured several female celebrities.

After ""Nice For What"" replaced his own ""God's Plan"" on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace their former number-one debut, Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion, with a planned release date of June 29, 2018. He then released ""I'm Upset"" on May 26, as the album's third single. Scorpion was then released as a double-album, and marked Drake's longest project, with a run-time of just under 90 minutes. The album broke both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it gained 132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming service, respectively. It eventually sold 749,000 album equivalent units in its first week of sales, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.

Shortly thereafter, Drake collaborated with British hip hop promotion Link Up TV on July 7, releasing a freestyle as a part of the promotion's 'Behind Barz' segment, before releasing another freestyle a week later after featuring on Charlie Sloth's long-running Fire in the Booth program on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Drake then earned his sixth number-one hit with ""In My Feelings"" on July 21, which also spawned the viral ""#InMyFeelingsChallenge"" or ""#KiKiChallenge"". The success of ""In My Feelings"" also made Drake the record holder for most number one hits among rappers. Soon after, he released the music video for ""Nonstop"", which was filmed in London during his surprise performance at the Wireless Festival.

He then appeared on the album Astroworld, featuring uncredited vocals for the song ""Sicko Mode"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Drake announced in July 2018 that he planned to ""take 6 months to a year"" to himself in order to produce television and films, including Euphoria. He then began the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour with co-headliners Migos on August 12. This preceded collaboration with Bad Bunny titled ""Mia"", which featured Drake performing in Spanish. He later received the award for Hot Ticket Performer at the 2018 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 16. During a performance in Edmonton on November 7, Drake announced his intention to begin composing his next project in early 2019.

2019–present: Upcoming album
In February 2019, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rap Song, for ""God's Plan"", at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. During his speech, producers abruptly cut to a commercial break, leading viewers to speculate they were censoring his speech during which he criticized The Recording Academy. A legal representative for the Academy then released a statement stating ""a natural pause [led] the producers [to] assume that he was done and cut to commercial,"" and added the organization offered him an opportunity to return to stage, but he declined.

On February 14, Drake re-released his third mixtape, So Far Gone, onto streaming services for the first time to commemorate its 10-year anniversary, and later collaborated with Summer Walker on a remix of Walker's song ""Girls Need Love"", marking his first release of 2019. On April 10, 2019 during a London performance on his Assassination Vacation Tour, the OVO leader told the crowd he was working on his new album before the show. On June 8, Drake appeared on Chris Brown's single ""No Guidance"". On June 15, Drake released two songs, ""Omertà"" and ""Money in the Grave"", on his EP The Best in the World Pack to celebrate the NBA Championship win of the Toronto Raptors. On August 2, he released the compilation album Care Package, consisting of songs released between 2010 and 2016 that were initially unavailable for purchase or commercial streaming; it debuted at number one.

Artistry - influences
Drake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West, Jay Z, and Lil Wayne, while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah, and Usher. Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his ""biggest inspirations"".

Musical style
Drake has credited Kanye West (left) and Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical influences. Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism. His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as ""ting"", ""touching road"", ""talkin' boasy"" and ""gwanin' wassy"". Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip-hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing. He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.

The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional or boastful. However, Drake is often revered for incorporating ""degrading"" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between ""pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata."" Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as ""hyper-reality rap"", which is characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as being distinct from the ""real world.""

Public image
The Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States, with his single, ""The Motto"", which includes, ""You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO."" Drake later popularized the term ""The Six"" in 2015 in relation his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city. Furthermore, the subject matter of his artistry often revolving around relationships, have had widespread impact on social media through photo captions commonly used to reference emotions or personal situations. However, his lyrical contents have had a negative reception from fans and critics deeming him as sensitive; a trait that is understood as being antithetical to hip hop culture. June 10 was declared ""Drake Day"" in Houston, Texas. In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines, in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance. In 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States. He would also donate $200,000 in order to aid relief efforts in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey. In February 2018, following the single ""God's Plan"" debut at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Drake donated $50,000 to a Miami homeless shelter and giving a University of Miami student $50,000 to help with her tuition. Drake then ""kept up the spending spree"" by donating the rest of the song's video budget, $996,631.90, to several charitable causes and regular people across Miami.

The music video for ""Hotline Bling"" went viral, due to Drake's eccentric choices in dancing. The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake's unconventional nature on the song, causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, spawning several parodies. Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exampled by the video for ""Hotline Bling"". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6"" Classic Boots. This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose, in which various items of clothing were produced. Drake had also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the ""Air Jordan OVOs"". Moreover, his style and dress sense have caused GQ magazine to describe him as ""[one of] the most stylish men alive"".

Controversies - legal issues
In 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on ""Marvins Room"". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties. Despite Drake's legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling ""Jimmy Smith Rap"", a 1982 single by jazz musician, Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who stated Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on ""Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2"", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop. Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement. Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics on when collaborating with YG on the song ""Who Do You Love?"". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year. In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.

In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel ""Chubbs"" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also says the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering. The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu, after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference; the judge ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense.

Feuds
Drake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident and released a song criticizing Drake weeks later. Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute.

In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe magazine. Drake would later respond on ""6 God"" and ""6PM in New York"", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment.

Further controversy arose in July 2015, when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during recording sessions for ""RICO"", one of the lead singles off of Mill's second studio album. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller. Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for ""R.I.C.O."". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for ""R.I.C.O."", ""10 Bands"", and ""Know Yourself"". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, titled ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back"", in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with ""Wanna Know"", before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later. Despite subliminal disses from either artist, the feud has not been officially reignited. Drake would further seek to denounce Funkmaster Flex during his Madison Square Garden shows on the Summer Sixteen Tour. Following Meek Mill's sentencing of two to four years for probation violation, Drake stated ""Free Meek Mill"" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on ""Family Feud"". Pusha T would also use the same rationale to criticize Drake on ""Infrared"" in 2018, prompting Drake to respond with the ""Duppy Freestyle"" diss track on May 25. Pusha T would directly respond to the track through ""The Story of Adidon"" on May 29, which presented several claims, including an accusation of Drake fathering a secret child. The pair is considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, with Drake yet to respond to ""The Story of Adidon"".

In 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through ""4PM in Calabasas"", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on ""No Shopping"" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song. However, French Montana claimed that Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake, he has yet to officially respond to Budden. In the same year, Drake mocked Kid Cudi for his mental health, drug use and suicidal urges on ""Two Birds, One Stone"" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter. Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.

In mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator, Kanye West. In an appearance on the talk show The Shop in October, Drake recounted several business meetings with West, who voiced his desire to ""be Quincy Jones"" and work with him, in order to replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson. West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, which was agreed to as Drake ""felt a genuine vibe"" from West, and after West gifted him the beat to ""Lift Yourself"", which inspired Drake to begin writing to the instrumental. West then requested Drake to travel to Wyoming to continue working, and arrived a day after close friend 40. 40 said West was working on an album; contradictory to his previous aim of just wanting to ""give [Drake] beats"". Drake responded by saying West stated he would release in late 2018, and they should continue on. However, upon his arrival in Wyoming, Drake ""[spent] the majority of time working on [West's] music"", only exploring his own after playing the producer the song ""March 14"", which addresses Drake's relationship with his newborn son and co-parent. This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T. West would also release ""Lift Yourself"", and produce ""Infrared""; actions that greatly displeased Drake. This prompted him to denounce West in several songs and live performances. West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018.

Drake has purported to have been in reported feuds with DMX, Kendrick Lamar, Common, The Weeknd, XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez, and Ludacris, although the latter three have been reported to be resolved.

Business ventures - Endorsements
Prior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient. In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger King and Whataburger. Business magazine Forbes commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships ""combined heavily"" for Drake's reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the highest-paid celebrities during that period.

Main article: OVO Sound
During the composition of Nothing Was the Same, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, and business partner, Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the trio to team up to form OVO Sound. The name is an abbreviation derived from the October's Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects. Warner Bros. Records currently distribute the label.

Drake, 40 and PartyNextDoor were the label's inaugural artists. The label houses artists including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, OB O'Brien, Roy Woods, dvsn, Plaza, and Kash Doll, as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Mike Zombie, Nineteen85, and Future the Prince. OVO Sound has released six albums, with two certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Toronto Raptors
On September 30, 2013, at a press conference with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke, Drake was announced as the new ""global ambassador"" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. This would also be the setting where Drake was given The Key to the City. In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities, beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary. He began by hosting an annual ""Drake Night"" segment with the organization, which began in 2013.

Apple Music
Following the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million. This saw all future solo releases by Drake becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers. Drake had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted More Life. Drake's partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform's sharp success, as it attained 10 million subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists, such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services. Through signing with the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before the smartwatch saw public release.

Virginia Black
Two months prior to the release of Views, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based whiskey. This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring's Restaurant in Toronto. The beverage was created and also distributed alongside Proximo Spirits, as well as with Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008. The company described the partnership as ""fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey.""

The product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically. The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music and various tours, such as being part of the ""Virginia Black VIP Lounge"" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016. The company later aired commercials with Dennis Graham, which featured the tagline of ""The Realest Dude Ever"" (in reference toward ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to various European countries in 2017.

Personal life
Drake lives in Hidden Hills, California, since 2012. He also owns a property in Toronto, which was built from the ground-up in 2017, and a Toronto condo adjacent to the CN Tower. He owns a Boeing 767 airplane.

Drake's paternal uncles are bass guitarist Larry Graham and musician Teenie Hodges. Graham achieved both critical and commercial success as a member of the band Sly and the Family Stone, while Hodges featured as the lead guitarist and songwriter for Al Green, and contributed heavily on much of his work in the 1970s, including the hits ""Take Me to the River"", ""Love and Happiness"", and ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"".

Drake is a father to one son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French artist Sophie Brussaux. Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumors after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017; Drake eventually confirmed his fatherhood on the album Scorpion in 2018.

Drake dated singer Rihanna off-and-on from 2009 to 2016. He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums, and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said ""she's a woman I've been in love with since I was 22 years old."" On becoming a single parent, he mused on the talk show The Shop:

As life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don't have the fairy tale, like, 'Oh, Drake started a family with Rihanna and this is like so perfect.' It looks so good on paper. By the way, I wanted that too at one time.

Other artists
There are several other artists that have performed under the name Drake:

92,yot club,1193770,25501089,"Ryan Kaiser, known professionally as Yot Club, is an American bedroom pop artist originating from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and presently based in Nashville, Tennessee.

Kaiser embarked on a musical journey prior to Yot Club under the moniker Amateur Observer, sharing his creations on platforms like SoundCloud and Bandcamp. Despite its existence for about a year, Kaiser eventually deleted the project due to feelings of insecurity.

Transitioning to Yot Club, Kaiser's musical identity took shape upon entering the music scene in 2019. His sound is characterized by distorted vocals, lo-fi beats, guitar tracks enriched with chorus pedal effects, warm guitar leads, analog synth melodies, and light pads.

Embracing a minimalist approach to recording, Kaiser intentionally operates within self-imposed limitations, such as employing a single microphone. This streamlined technique fuels his creativity and encourages innovative experimentation. His compositions typically begin with guitar foundations, which he gradually augments with additional instruments. Kaiser's meticulous processing of vocals, incorporating clip distortion and reverb, results in a signature tone.

Most music is created in his bedroom, and on occasion, he transforms his car into a miniature recording studio. Despite the modest setting, Kaiser's inventive prowess shines through in his compositions. This creative endeavor has garnered significant recognition, with his music amassing over two million streams on Spotify.

His artistic approach is rooted in a sense of preservation, viewing his music as a digital diary that deserves a place in the world. The desire to safeguard his creations from potential loss or obscurity drove Kaiser to release his music to the public.

Kaiser's discography under the Yot Club alias has exhibited remarkable productivity. Since his 2019 debut, he has released three EPs and a total of twenty-six tracks within a single year. 

A pivotal moment in Kaiser's career came with his signing to Nice Guys, a record label headquartered in Paris. This partnership facilitated the release of his work to a wider audience, including the notable EP ""Nature Machine,"" which debuted on July 14, 2020. The EP, along with eight additional tracks, is showcasing his versatility through covers of songs by The Smiths and Mountain Goats. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Yot+Club"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

94,bts,1889136,2229509777,"BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band formed in Seoul in 2013. The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several world tours.

The group initially formed as teenagers under Big Hit Entertainment and released their debut single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. Billboard 200 entries The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 (2015), The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016), and Wings (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. Wings became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) with their single ""Mic Drop"". The band is the first Korean act to top the U.S. Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums Love Yourself: Answer (2018) and Map of the Soul: Persona (2019), making BTS the first group since The Beatles to earn three number one albums in less than a year, and the fastest to earn three number one albums since The Monkees in 1967. Love Yourself: Answer also broke South Korea's Gaon Album Chart's all-time monthly record previously set by Love Yourself: Tear and became the first Korean album certified Gold in the United States.

According to Gaon Music Chart, BTS has sold fifteen million albums domestically and is the best-selling artist to debut in the 2010s. They hold the best-selling album in Korean history with Map of the Soul: Persona. BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the IFPI's Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. The group has won Top Social Artist three years in a row and Top Duo/Group at the 26th Billboard Music Awards. Featured on Time's international cover as ""Next Generation Leaders"", BTS has appeared in the magazine's 25 most influential people on the internet (2017–2019) and Time's 100 most influential people in the world (2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname 'Princes of Pop'. Forbes Korea named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018, and BTS ranked 43rd in the Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities. During their 2019 Love Yourself World Tour, BTS became the first Asian artist ever to headline and sell out Wembley Stadium and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in Rose Bowl Stadium history.

96,armin van buuren,1606409,55864542,"Armin van Buuren (born Armin Jozef Jacobus Daniël van Buuren, December 25, 1976) is a trance (mostly progressive trance and uplifting trance) music producer and DJ from the Netherlands. His musical career started in 1995.

He has been named number one in the prestigious DJ MAG Top 100 poll four times in a row, from 2007 till 2010 and for the 5th time in 2012. He's the first DJ in the history of the DJ Magazine to achieve that and an indication of his prolific output over more than 14 years he’s been dj’ing and producing. Being the official World’s Most Popular DJ is just one of his many achievements, but the driving force behind his success is an overriding passion for electronic dance music.

2008 began with the success that the number one DJ seems to attract; he was awarded with the prestigious Buma Cultuur Pop Award in January. This was followed by being voted as the Best Trance Artist in the Beatport Music Awards in March; judged on the musician’s artistic achievements, national and international success, it is evident that Armin van Buuren has become one of the decade’s most influential trance acts.

Even a basic list of recent successes reads like a lifetime of work: ‘Best Album’ for artist album ‘Shivers’ at both the Dutch Release Dance Awards and the prestigious Edison Awards; ‘Best Compilation’ for ‘A State Of Trance’, in 2006, claiming the ‘Best European DJ’ award in 2007 and ‘Best Mix Radio Show’ at the Miami Winter Music Conference in 2006 and 2007, for radio show ‘A State Of Trance’ – now broadcasting on a massive 40 FM stations as well as satellite and internet radio, with over 26 million listeners a week; a 5th year residency in Ibiza at Amnesia and over 50,000 downloads every week from podcasting high end chart-bothering positions all over the world for singles, albums and compilations , with single “Rush Hour” used as the theme tune to the UEFA European Youth Championship; the #1 entry in the Dutch album charts with his artist album ‘Imagine’, the #1 entry of the DVD registration of ‘Armin Only ‘ Imagine’ – the landmarks just keep coming!

The 350th episode and the 7th year of the hit radio show ‘A State of Trance’ was celebrated in May 2008 with an eight hour live broadcast from Antwerp in Belgium to over 40 radio stations internationally. Fans were invited to a free party with a line up that had been voted for by the show’s listeners; another example of the importance the DJ places on the satisfaction of his fans. Considering the popularity of the radio show the introduction of ‘A State of Trance Podcast’ was a natural progression. The weekly podcasts which contain highlights and Armin’s favourite tracks from the previous episode ensure that trance lovers across the world will never miss another episode!
Sold-out shows for Armin Only in 2005 and 2006 created eager anticipation of the third edition, which kicked off in a sold-out Jaarbeurs in Utrecht in 2008; over 16,000 fans attended and were enthralled by the DJ’s nine hour set. The theme of the night was ‘Imagine’, described by Armin as “the celebration of our sensations both in life and in clubland.” Fans all around the world should not despair, as ‘Armin Only’ tour dates have also been set for Romania, Poland, Belgium and Australia; the DJ will also be touring in England, Scotland, Ibiza, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, and the USA, with expected dates in, for an example, the Czech Republic.

Born in Leiden, Holland (on December 25, 1976) to a musical family, Armin indulged his passion for music from a young age. He spent all the money he earned with his paper round on records. His mum won a computer when he was 10, gaining Armin’s interest. “So as a little nerdy kid I was writing my own basic programmes, and learnt about the technology from there.” He progressed from making low-profile mix tapes for friends to higher profile mixes when he discovered experimenting with different sequences on his computer through his uncle. “I was so stunned by what I saw him doing on the computer, that I got addicted to creating music right there and then!”
“I loved dance music immediately – this great rebellious sound that was so different to the ‘beautiful’ songs of the years before”. Armin cites electronic pioneer Jean Michel Jarre as a major influence (famed for his awesome visuals as well as his groundbreaking synth sounds), as well as Dutch producer Ben Liebrand, who later mentored him in his mixing and producing.
In the early days, Armin thought it was wise to have something extra in case the DJ’ing didn’t work out. So he studied for a law degree. The final year of his course was inevitably stretched as he juggled his studies with his increasingly hectic schedule; his rise to fame included lots of productions and remixes, as well as playing out to packed clubs every weekend. It took him three years to graduate, but his determination made him succeed!

Armin’s own productions have all made a huge impact and quickly gain worldwide acclaim; his latest artist album titled ‘Imagine’ entered the Dutch Album Top 100 Chart at number one; this is the first time a dance producer has ever accomplished such a feat in the history of Dutch music. The first single to be taken from this album, ‘Going Wrong’ with DJ Shah featuring Chris Jones, entered the Dutch Singles Chart at number five. The ‘Armin Only DVD’ was also released and reached the acclaimed number one spot in its second week. His back catalogue includes Blue Fear, Communication, Sound of Goodbye, Shivers, Rush Hour, Burned With Desire, Exhale, Love You More, This World Is Watching Me, and Yet Another Day. While the remix offers flood in, Armin only takes on tracks that he really loves. He uses exactly the same criteria for his compilations, meaning that every release from Armin or his long-running Armind label is a bone fide stormer that’s earned its place. His output includes tracks for the cult TV series 24, and the likes of Motorcycle’s As The Rush Comes.
Armin is a dedicated trance lover, but isn’t imprisoned by a single genre, saying “What makes trance work so well is that it doesn’t stick to one style, and can incorporate electro, minimal, whatever it likes.” His desire to showcase more of the great music he hears, along with the number of people sending him tracks they wanted to release, led to the obvious step of starting his own label, Armada, in 2003.

The label is a joint venture between Armin, Maykel Piron (former head of A&R for Warner Music) and David Lewis, who'd previously managed Armin. ""What we wanted was a company that could offer everything for an artist: representation, a booking agency, and a record company. Artists can choose full management, or to just release a record or play out at gigs. Armada lets the artists choose what they want without telling them what to do"".
Armin is now a fully-fledged artist in his own right, having made his songwriting debut on his album, the award-winning Shivers; The events continue to get bigger and bigger, and Armin regularly headlines the likes of Sensation White, Global Gathering, Dance Valley, ZoukOut, Mysteryland, Coachella, Beats In Brazil, Trance Energy, Fort Dance, Summer Days – basically whether you’re in Australia, Russia, the Middle East, the US or Europe, you can catch Armin van Buuren at a club or festival near you!
""This is just what I really want,"" says Armin. ""It’s not just love for music, it’s my passion. It goes beyond liking, and beyond a hobby, it’s about a way of living. Music is essential to my life”.

109,nf,1067520,75146131,"NF is the stage name of rapper and composer Nate Feuerstein from Gladwin, Michigan. Feuerstein endured a hardship-filled childhood in which his parents divorced, his mother's boyfriend physically abused him, and his mother eventually killed herself. Music was his escape, and he began recording songs on a karaoke machine, with instrumentals on one microphone and his raps in the other. Placing second in a nationwide Fine Arts Festival rap competition in 2008, and first in Michigan the following year, he independently released a debut album, Moments, in 2010. The album attracted the attention of Xist Music, which signed him to a recording deal in 2012, by which time Feuerstein had taken on the stage name NF. The label announced the release of an EP that same year, but it never appeared, and NF and Xist parted ways. NF spent the next two years looking for a label and working with local producer Tommee Profitt in his studio; they came up with the song ""Wake Up,"" which convinced Capitol Christian Music Group to sign him. CMG released a six-song (including a Manny Marroquin remix of ""Wake Up"") self-titled EP late in the summer of 2014. His debut album, Mansion, was released in early 2015 and reached number 62 on the Billboard 200 while topping the Christian Albums chart. The aptly titled Therapy Session followed in 2016 and also topped the Christian Albums chart with its raw emotions and honest lyrics. The following Summer saw the release of the singles ""Outro"" and ""Green Lights"", in anticipation of the arrival of his third studio long player, Perception, which dropped later that October. NF achieved mainstream popularity in 2017 with Perception; the album charted at number one in the United States and was certified platinum, while its third single, ""Let You Down"", reached number twelve on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was a top-ten hit internationally.

""Ojalá Que Llueva Café"" (""I Wish That It Rains Coffee"") is one of his most critically acclaimed self-written and composed pieces.

The artist prefers not to disclose her birth details, ""I never denied my age. I never lied about it. I just don't say anything now... Everything is wrong online.""

She explained choosing a music career: ""One day I was at the park with my family, all my cousins and stuff, in Frankston... We were all just singing a song and my aunty was like 'oh guys, she can actually hold a note.' I think that's the earliest memory of someone actually pointing me out as someone that has an ability to sing. I was probably like 7 years old."" The singer-songwriter had learned to play keyboards and drum pads while at secondary school.She started busking in Melbourne, while working in fashion retail at the Universal Store.

In 2009, as Toni Watson, she created a YouTube page and posted a cappella cover versions of songs. She performed local gigs and festivals, including the Let Go festival. Tones was the vocalist for a duo in 2014, and remembered: ""I started out singing in small pubs and bars in Mornington, I was singing along to a guitarist until I ended up branching out on my own."" She explained her shift to a solo career: ""I actually got made redundant from my retail job and with that money I bought an RC300 (loop station) and just started to try to figure it all out."" She busked ""up and down the east coast with her synthesizers and loop pedal, she has been building a loyal fanbase and captivating crowds with her genre-diverse style.""

In September 2017, the singer-songwriter travelled to Byron Bay in the Australian state of New South Wales to try busking there. At an early performance, she met Jackson Walkden-Brown who became her manager about a month later. Her busking success led to a greater commitment to a music career. The artist spent 2018 living between Walkden-Brown's home in the Gold Coast hinterland and in her van in Byron Bay, writing music and busking full-time. Later that year she won the Battle of the Buskers at Buskers by the Creek. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Tones+and+I"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They consist of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion and creative director Phil Harvey. They met at University College London and began playing music together from 1996 to 1998, initially calling themselves Starfish. Coldplay's music incorporates elements of soft rock, pop rock, piano rock, and post-britpop.

After independently releasing an extended play, Safety (1998), Coldplay signed with Parlophone in 1999. The band's debut album, Parachutes (2000), included their breakthrough single ""Yellow"" and received a Brit Award for British Album of the Year, a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album and a Mercury Prize nomination. Their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), won the same accolades and included ""Clocks"", which earned a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. In 2005, they released X&Y; the album was marked by a troubled production and various delays, completing what the band considered a trilogy as well. Coldplay's fourth effort, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), received a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album and their first Album of the Year nomination, while its title track was the first British group song to reach number-one in the United Kingdom and United States simultaneously in the 21st century. Both X&Y and Viva la Vida were the best-selling albums of their respective years, topping the charts in more than 30 countries each.

Since then, Coldplay further diversified their sound with the subsequent releases Mylo Xyloto (2011), Ghost Stories (2014), A Head Full of Dreams (2015), Everyday Life (2019) and Music of the Spheres (2021). Each album presented a unique theme and added new musical styles to the band's original repertoire, including electronica, ambient, pop, R&B, funk, classical, jazz fusion, and progressive rock. They are also known for ""euphoric"" live performances, which NME said are when the band ""come alive and make the most sense"". To celebrate their 20th anniversary in 2018, a career-spanning documentary directed by Mat Whitecross was premiered at selected cinemas, featuring previously unseen behind-the-scenes footage.

With 100 million albums sold worldwide, Coldplay are the most successful band of the 21st century and one of the best-selling music acts of all time. According to Fuse, they are also the sixth-most awarded group in history. Other notable achievements include the seventh-highest-grossing tour of all time, three of the 50 highest-selling albums ever in the United Kingdom, the most number-one records in the country without ever missing the top, most nominations and wins for a band in Brit Awards history, and becoming the first British group to debut at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100. Coldplay are considered one of the most influential bands of the 21st century as well, with Forbes describing them as the standard for the current alternative scene. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included A Rush of Blood to the Head on their ""200 Definitive Albums"" list and the single ""Yellow"" is part of their ""Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll"" exhibition for being one of the most successful and important recordings in the industry. In spite of their popularity and impact, Coldplay have earned a reputation as polarizing music icons.

He is known for his raps, songs and choruses in both Dutch and English. Apart from being a performing artist himself, he is also active as song writer and producer.

In the hip hop scene Mr. Probz is known for the critically acclaimed songs 'Drivin', 'Who Are You' and 'Get My Props', a string of hits in his native language in The Netherlands and many collaborations with well known hip hop artists in the United States. Despite offers to sign with record labels, both in The Netherlands and in the US, Mr. Probz decided to keep building a strong foundation in Europe as an independent artist.

Mr. Probz had been creatively active since a young age, already occupying himself with graffiti as a youngster and writing lyrics about his every day experiences. At a young age he was faced with the typical trials and tribulations of inner city youth growing up, spending large portions of his time on the streets and viewing his music as the one path out of a life of poverty and crime.

August 6 th 2010, Mr. Probz got shot down in the centre of Amsterdam. In the hospital the popular hip hop artist received massive attention from the Dutch media and support from fellow musicians and fans. Within days after his release from the hospital, Mr. Probz was already back to focusing on his music. Half a year after the accident, the Dutch hit song ‘Meisje Luister’ of him and Kleine Viezerik was a #1 hit at the FunX Hip Hop Chart.

In 2010 Mr. Probz was nominated for a BNN/State Award in the category ‘Best Artist’. He was the first unsigned artist to get this nomination in the award show’s history.

In the Dutch motion picture 'Bolletjes Blues' Mr. Probz plays the role of lead character Jimmy. ‘Bolletjes Blues’ was the first Dutch hip hop film.

In his career Mr. Probz recorded and worked closely with artists like Alchemist, Joell Ortiz, Joe Budden, Scott Storch, Yukmouth, Grafh, Raekwon, Royce da 5’9 and Giorgio Tuinfort (Konvict Music), among many others.

Currently Mr. Probz is readying his debut album, called ‘The Treatment’. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mr.+Probz"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

140,vendredi sur mer,362603,5260821,"From Geneva, Switzerland, although her nationality is usually defined as Franco-Swiss. Her name is Charline Mignot, but artistically she is known as Vendredi sur Mer.

Coming into the world in the mid 90's, Charline grows up with a very introverted view of the world around her. As she grew up and wanted to explain her surroundings in her own way, she moved more and more towards the arts, fashion and photography, and it is in the latter that she dedicated her studies.

In his quest to make his own mark and push his own boundaries within the aesthetics he used for his photographs, he eventually started writing songs. The first time was with the idea of using self-made music for her photo shoots, knowing that music would help set the mood within the shoot. That's how her first song, ""Est-ce que tu t'en souviens"", was created.

Their style is quite distinctive, having been described as dream-pop, electro-pop, electro-ambient and even ""space-disco"". The marriage of Charline's art and direction caught the attention of Swiss and French producers, including Lewis Ofman, who produced her most listened-to single, ""La femme á la peau bleue"", in 2016, a song that became famous in the fashion world as the official music for one of Sonia Rykiel's 2017 collections.

Mignot's voice is always soft, as if she were singing from a reverie. She uses a spoken voice in all her songs, which come across best as storytelling about women, sensuality, love and heartbreak. In some interviews she has expressed frustration at being associated with radical feminism just because her music is about women, ""as if it's something abnormal or radicalised for a woman to write about women instead of men"", so she often says that she goes between one gender and the other, to create confusion among listeners.

Vendredi sur Mer's first EP came out in 2017 and is called ""Marée basse"", the only studio album she has released to date is called ""Premiers émois"" and was released in 2019 with the single ""Chewing-Gum"".

Do you like women who make music independently and maintain a beautiful aesthetic to match their creations and their music videos? Vendredi sur Mer is our cool woman of the week and the right choice for you. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Vendredi+sur+Mer"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

143,rex orange county,1703760,101248410,"Alexander James O'Connor (born 4 May 1998), known professionally as Rex Orange County, is an English singer, multi-instrumentalist, and songwriter. O'Connor rose to prominence in 2017 following multiple features on Tyler, the Creator's Grammy-nominated album Flower Boy, including the single ""Boredom"". NPR Music journalist Zoë Jones has described O'Connor's music as ""a bright blend of hip-hop, jazz, and bedroom pop”.

Under the Rex Orange County moniker, O'Connor has released one mixtape, bcos u will never b free, and three studio albums: Apricot Princess, Pony, and Who Cares?. Both Pony and Who Cares? made the top 5 in the UK and US, and the latter topped the UK Albums Chart. O'Connor also released a live album, entitled Live at Radio City Music Hall, in 2020.

Alexander James O'Connor was born on 4 May 1998, to Nina and Phil O'Connor, a professional sports photographer. He grew up in the village of Grayshott, Hampshire near Haslemere. O'Connor's interest in music began at a young age. At age 5, O'Connor joined the choir at the school where his mother worked. He became a drummer and later taught himself piano. The name Rex Orange County is based on a teacher-given nickname, ""The OC"", after his surname O'Connor.

At age 16, O'Connor began playing the guitar and started to produce his own music using Apple's Logic software. At this age, he also began attending the BRIT School where he studied drumming and was one of four percussionists in his year; the relative rareness of his primary instrument provided him with wide exposure to various projects of others in his school which he credits with exposing him to new music.

On 4 September 2015, O'Connor self-released his debut album bcos u will never b free on SoundCloud and Bandcamp. Upon listening to the album, fellow English musician and producer Two Inch Punch got in touch with him, providing him with a management team. The two have continued to collaborate throughout O'Connor's career in the form of the tracks ""UNO"", ""Best Friend"", and ""Untitled"". The album also caught the attention of American rapper Tyler, the Creator, who sent him an email describing his enjoyment of the project. This led to him flying O'Connor out the following year to Los Angeles to collaborate on his album Flower Boy, with him co-writing and contributing vocals to the songs ""Boredom"" and ""Foreword"". On 17 November 2016, O'Connor released the single ""UNO"", a song Clash magazine described by writing, ""The buoyant keyboard riff underpins a hypnotic half-spoken vocal, one that veers from topic to topic in a hazy burst of creative mania."" On 25 January 2017, he released the single “Best Friend” (premiering on Apple Music's Beats 1 station), followed later in the year by the release of his second album Apricot Princess. His work was compared by Aimee Cliff of The Fader in 2017 to ""other artsy, post-genre teen artists, such as Kevin Abstract or Steve Lacy"".

O'Connor's first release following the success of Apricot Princess and Flower Boy was on 11 October 2017 with the single ""Loving Is Easy"", created in collaboration with the Dutch artist Benny Sings. On 16 April 2018, he performed the song in his television debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. On 31 May 2018, he released a cover of ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" in collaboration with Randy Newman, the creator of the song. He was also featured in Spotify's Rise Program.

On 9 October 2018, O'Connor was scheduled to appear on the French television program Quotidien, but refused to perform because it featured a sketch by comedian Alison Wheeler parodying the Ku Klux Klan, which he called ""tasteless"".

On 14 February 2019, O'Connor released the single ""New House"". Later that year on 12 September, he released ""10/10""; the lead single from his third album Pony. Released on 25 October 2019, Pony was his first major-label album released through RCA Records.

On 30 September 2020, O'Connor released an EP with recordings from his performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City during his Pony tour titled Live at Radio City Music Hall alongside a documentary released on YouTube. This documentary showed the events leading up to this performance as well as the early conclusion of the Pony tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In October 2020, O'Connor confirmed that he was in the process of recording a fourth studio album titled Who Cares? In January 2021, he liked a Tweet seemingly confirming that it would be released at some point later that year. However, this did not materialize. On 13 January 2022, he began officially teasing the album, sending out postcards containing a phone number that when called, a snippet of the song would play. The album was released on 11 March 2022, and was his first to top the UK Albums Chart, entering ahead of Impera by Ghost.

Growing up, O'Connor listened to Queen, ABBA, Stevie Wonder, and American alternative artists like Weezer and Green Day. He cites these artists and others as core inspirations for his own music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Rex+Orange+County"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Her songs ""Alaska"" and ""Dog Years"" placed numbers 64 and 173 on Triple J Hottest 100, 2016, respectively.

After the Pharrell video went viral, several different record labels tried to sign Rogers. She ended up negotiating a contract with Capitol Records where ""she licenses her music to them through her own imprint, Debay Sounds.""

Rogers's EP, Now That the Light Is Fading, was released on February 17, 2017. She released her major-label debut album, Heard It In a Past Life, in January 2019. The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200.

She made her television debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on February 15, 2017, Saturday Night Live debut on November 3, 2018 and Today Show debut on July 12, 2019.

She cites Carrie Brownstein, Patti Smith, Kim Gordon, and Björk as her musical inspirations, while prominent singers Brandi Carlile and Sharon Van Etten - who she calls her ""musical big sisters"" - have become mentors.

149,yoasobi,664230,39699822,"YOASOBI (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese music duo composed of vocaloid music producer Ayase and vocalist Ikura (幾田りら/Lilas Ikuta). The group has released four music videos, all of which are based on short stories posted on Monogatary, a website operated by Sony Music Japan, later also from various novels and book tie-ups.

The name ""YOASOBI"" originates from the Japanese word 夜遊び, meaning ""nightlife"". Ayase, who is a producer of the group said he named it as a wish that he could take on various playful challenges by comparing the appearance of acting as an individual to the appearance of daytime and the appearance of two people acting as YOASOBI as the appearance of the night.

The group has a slogan ""novel into music"" (小説を音楽にする, shōsetsu o ongaku ni suru), , which goes along with their amazing ability to create songs with incredibly meaningful lyrics, especially when it comes to their themes for various anime and games.

2019-2020: Formation and rising up with ""Yoru ni Kakeru""
Both members of YOASOBI had active music careers prior to forming the group. Ayase gained a following on the video hosting site Niconico since his first upload on 24 December 2018, a song titled Sentensei Assault Girl (先天性アサルトガール). On 23 November 2019, he released an EP, Yūrei Tōkyō (幽霊東京), which reached third on iTunes' album chart. Ikuta, performing under the name Rira Ikuta (幾田りら), had already released two EPs: Rerise in 2017 and Jukebox in 2019.

The first song released by the duo was ""Yoru ni Kakeru"", based on Mayo Hoshino's short story ""Thanatos no Yūwaku"" hosted on Monogatary. The music video was released first on 16 November 2019, where it broke 10 million views in five months on YouTube as well as being popular on TikTok. It was subsequently released as a single on 15 December 2019, where it topped the popularity charts on both Spotify and Line Music. More than five months after its release, the single would top the Billboard Japan Hot 100 on 1 June 2020.

Following the success of their first release, on 18 January 2020, YOASOBI released their second single, ""Ano Yume o Nazotte"", this time based on Sōta Ishiki's ""Yume no Shizuku to Hoshi no Hana"". On 20 April 2020, Yoasobi released a teaser for their third single, ""Halzion"", which is based on Shunki Hashizume's ""Soredemo, Happy End"". ""Halzion"" marked the first time that YOASOBI collaborated with a professional novelist, whereas the first two were amateur writers. The single was released as a promotional project by Suntory to advertise their new energy drink named Zone. The single was official released on 11 May 2020.

In the second half of the year, Yoasobi released their fourth song, ""Tabun"", on July 20. The song was based on the short story of the same name by Shinano.[15] Their fifth song, ""Gunjō"" was released September 1. The song collaborated with a manga, Blue Period for Bourbon's Alfort Mini Chocolate advertisement. The song was based on Alfort's television advertisement story text Ao o Mikata ni.[16] On December 18, the duo released their sixth song, ""Haruka"", based on Osamu Suzuki's novel, Tsuki Ōji.[17]

On December 31, 2020, they debuted in 71st NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen and performed ""Yoru ni Kakeru"", which is also their first live performance.

On January 6, 2021, Yoasobi released their first extended play and first physical release The Book, which included the six previous songs and three new songs, ""Encore"" as a lead single, ""Epilogue"" as an intro, and ""Prologue"" as an outro.[19] The duo also released their seventh song, ""Kaibutsu"", on the same day.[20] The song has been featured as the opening theme song for the second season of the anime television series Beastars.[21] The anime's ending theme song and duo's eighth song, ""Yasashii Suisei"", was released on January 20.[22] Both were released as a double A-side single in physical format on March 24.[23]

On January 20, the duo opened their fan club website ""Club Yoasobi"" (CLUB 夜遊)[24] and announced that they would hold their first concert, Keep Out Theater on February 14[25] at the inside of the building under construction at the former site of Shinjuku Milano for an online audience of 40,000 people.[26]

The duo released the ninth song for the Fuji TV's morning show Mezamashi TV, titled ""Mō Sukoshi Dake"" on May 10, and was based on a novel Meguru, which won the Yoasobi Contest Vol.3 with Mezamashi TV by Chiharu.[27] ""Sangenshoku"", an upcoming tenth song for the advertisement for the NTT Docomo's mobile service Ahamo, was based on a novel RPG by scriptwriter Yūichirō Komikado.[28] It will be released in the early summer of 2021.

151,the chainsmokers,2272747,69050092,"A production duo featuring Andrew Taggart and Alex Pall, the Chainsmokers mix dance and pop into a chart-topping sound that spawned hits like ""Roses,"" ""Closer,"" and ""Don't Let Me Down."" Pall and Taggart first made a name for themselves by creating remixes of their favorite indie bands that garnered tens of millions of streams. The duo released its official debut single, ""#Selfie,"" which celebrated and skewered 2010s narcissism, in January 2014. The track's bouncy beats and self-obsessed words hit number one on the Billboard dance chart and sold over ten million copies. Meanwhile, ""#Selfie""'s video featured cameos by Snoop Dogg and David Hasselhoff, fueling the song's viral popularity to hundreds of millions of views. More singles, including ""Kanye"" and ""Let You Go,"" followed.

In 2015, they issued the Bouquet EP on Disruptor Records, a softer and more indie-flavored effort that featured the single ""Roses,"" which was certified double-platinum and hit number one on the Top Dance Songs chart. The song also earned the Chainsmokers nominations for the Billboard Music Awards in the Top Dance/Electronic Artist and Top Dance/Electronic Song categories. After playing over 300 shows in 2015, including dates at festivals like Lollapalooza, Firefly, Tomorrowland, and Ultra, the duo returned in 2016 with the platinum-certified ""Don't Let Me Down,"" a collaboration with Pittsburgh pop singer Daya that topped the Billboard dance chart and would later win a Grammy. That year, the Chainsmokers also performed as part of the Tilt Tour, the first ever fan-sourced tour. In addition, Pall and Taggart host two SiriusXM shows: Nice Hair, a monthly mix; and the weekly YouTube EDM 15.

The follow-up single to ""Don't Let Me Down"" would carry the duo to new heights. Featuring Halsey on vocals, ""Closer"" began its slow climb to the top of the singles chart in the summer of 2016. Once it hit number one, it remained in the top spot for over ten weeks, breaking the record previously held by Drake's ""One Dance."" As their chart dominance continued, they released the Collage EP, which joined their two Top Three singles with new collaborations featuring Phoebe Ryan, XYLØ, and Charlee. Their debut record, Memories: Do Not Open, arrived in 2017. Featuring guests Emily Warren, Jhene Aiko, Florida Georgia Line, and hit singles ""Paris"" and the Coldplay collaboration ""Something Just Like This,"" Memories debuted at the top of the Billboard chart. At the start of 2018, the pair veered in a more contemplative and lyrical direction with the single ""Sick Boy,"" which landed on the EP of the same name. Sick Boy debuted on the Billboard 200 just outside the Top 50. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Chainsmokers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His music also caught the attention of songwriters such as Dan Wilson known for his work with Adele, Scott Harris, Carrie Underwood, among others. Kahan deferred his admission to Tulane University to pursue his developing music career. Kahan has said that two career goals he wished for were to be verified on Instagram and to have a Wikipedia page.

Kahan followed it up with the release of ""Northern Attitude"" on September 16.

On October 14, 2022, Kahan released his album Stick Season. According to early reviews of the album from AP News, ""There’s irony there because these feel like songs both longtime listeners and newer fans will want to belt back to Kahan — not because they’re produced for stadiums or arenas, but because they’re full of nostalgic melodies that will resonate far beyond New England."" Kahan wrote this album during the pandemic which he spent back home in Vermont. Stick Season leans more into the folk genre than the rest of his older music which were more pop sounding. Kahan says that in his album, Stick Season, he wanted to pay homage to the folk singers that he grew up listening to. He adds that his greatest goal as a songwriter is to write music that other people can relate to and to be able to throw that lifeline to someone.

El mayor tiene solo 26 años y el menor 21. Son jóvenes, sí, pero ya son conscientes de su éxito y más que un grupo, ellos se consideran una familia, pues lo más importante, antes de cantar, es la unión y la lealtad a su amistad.

Todo comenzó en junio del año 2007 cuando se conocieron en un asado que organizó un amigo que tenían en común. Conversando se dieron cuenta de que los cuatro eran músicos y terminaron cantando hasta las 6 de la mañana.

Días después El Profe buscó a Dim y al Llanero y les propuso formar un grupo, pero Dim dijo que sí con la condición de que también incluyeran a Pablito, quien estaba de viaje en ese momento en Contadora, Panamá.

Fue tanta la emoción y la ansiedad por crear el grupo que inmediatamente llamaron a Pablito a Panamá y el aceptó sin dudarlo.

Paso a paso
Su segundo encuentro, o mejor dicho su primer ensayo, fue en el club house de un amigo del edificio San Mitchel, en el piso 21, desde donde se podía ver la ciudad d medellin completa. Este se convirtió durante varios meses en su ensayadero oficial y era allí donde pasaban noches enteras montando las canciones.

""Durante esas noches soñábamos con que algún día escucharían nuestras composiciones en todas esas casa que veíamos desde allá"", cuenta Dim.

""Y creo que lo estamos logrando, pero ahora la idea es que también nos escuchen en aquellas de las que solo veíamos la luz, arriba en las montañas"", continúa El Profe.

Su nombre
A la hora de pensar en cómo se llamarían, dieron muchas vueltas y hasta lo consultaron con sus familias y sus profesores.

Al principio le buscaron por el lado de sus iniciales o pensaron en jugar un poco con los nombres de David y Pablo, pero luego de intentarlo por muchos lados, se les ocurrió Piso 21, pues fue a esta altura donde realmente conformaron el grupo.

Pero a este nombre también le han encontrado una metáfora, pues según ellos, indica que para arriba es adonde quieren llegar, dando pasos lentos, pero seguros y muy largos.

Precisamente antes de empezar cada concierto, el grupo se reúne para gritar su frase favorita ""Piso 21, vamos pa'arriba papá"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Piso+21"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

164,lizzo,1510354,48293557,"Melissa Jefferson (born April 27, 1988 in Detroit, Michigan, U.S.), known professionally as Lizzo, is an American rapper and singer. She is a founding member of indie hip hop groups The Chalice, Grrrl Prty, The Clerb, Ellypseas, and Absynthe. Her debut album, Lizzobangers, was released in 2013. In 2015, she released her sophomore album, Big Grrrl Small World.

Born in Detroit in the late 80’s, Lizzo spent much of her formative years in the church, where she was raised on the gospel sounds of The Winans, The Clark Sisters, and Fred Hammond, along with mainstay secular artists such as Stevie Wonder and Elton John. At the age of 10 her family moved to Houston, TX, and Lizzo was exposed to a wide array of emerging Southern musical styles, from the trademark chopped and screwed rap tracks of the underground, to the progressive and polished R&B sounds of groups like Destiny’s Child that were raising the city’s national profile to new heights. In fact, it was after she stumbled across a Destiny’s Child performance at Wal-Mart that Lizzo—then a 5th grader-- was inspired to start writing music on her own. Over the next decade that decision would take her through the trenches of some of the most varied musical genres: R&B girl groups (I.N.I.T.I.A.L.S., Cornrow Clique), progressive rock bands (Elypseas), solo rap ventures, and electro-pop duos (Lizzo & The Larva Ink).

In 2011 she made the move to Minneapolis with Larva Ink in order to be a part of that city’s blossoming and collaborative musical community. Lizzo & The Larva Ink was well received there, and the group earned a few encouraging nods from the press. Lizzo was soon introduced to Sophia Eris and Claire de Lune, with whom she would form The Chalice, the three-piece all-female rap/R&B group that would elevate Lizzo’s profile and reputation. In 2012 The Chalice released We Are The Chalice, an album that would gain them instant local success amongst fans and critics alike, garnering City Pages’ prestigious Best New Band and Picked To Click accolades in the same year. 

The success brought setbacks, though, and a falling out soon led to the demise of Lizzo & The Larva Ink. Feeling discontent with the loss of one group and the hurried blur of success of another, Lizzo was creatively drained from writing We Are The Chalice in two short months. She found herself in the throes of her first full-blown case of writer’s block. Unable to create music for herself, she began listening to several different local albums in hopes of finding inspiration. It was LAVA BANGERS, a 20-track instrumental mixtape from Doomtree producer and Minneapolis music vet Lazerbeak, that ultimately caught her ear. Beaks’ beats proved the fix for Lizzo’s problem. “I sat at home and listened to LAVA BANGERS, and when “Lift Every Voice” came on, my writer’s block was cured,” says Lizzo. “I think it revived my gospel roots. I wrote pages and pages of songs, and finally reached out to Lazerbeak, not thinking anything would come of it.” 

Her timing could not have been better. Beak, impressed with Lizzo’s output with The Chalice, as well as her guest appearances on several other local releases, was looking for a change of pace from his daily Doomtree production and business responsibilities. He immediately signed on to work on some demos. Beat tapes were exchanged, songs were written, and mutual friend and musical collaborator Ryan Olson (Totally Gross National Product founder, Gayngs/Marijuana Deathsquads mastermind) was brought on board to creatively oversee the project. Olson recorded and edited all 15 tracks in his bedroom studio, bringing in laid back hype-man Cliff Rhymes along the way to add even more layers to Lizzo’s dynamic vocals.

LIZZOBANGERS is the culmination of that four-way collaboration, an album that manages to capture all of the varied musical influences of Lizzo’s upbringing and combine them with the forward-thinking experimental production style of Beak and Olson. The end result is a brave new project that encapsulates the best parts of both the familiar and the future.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lizzo"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

165,bon entendeur,145269,1852550,"From shared passions was born an extraordinary project: Bon Entendeur. A duo in love with French culture and curious to invent hybrid formats fed by their passions. The result: Aller-retour. A cluster of beautiful ideas gathered in a unique album. 

Their adventure starts with a rather classical approach: arranging playlists fed with music they like. They gradually added what would become their trademark: the grain of a personality's voice on mixed music. Their format is declined during 5 years, 40 mixtapes, more than 70 million listening. A quality signature. Bon Entendeur has this desire to talk about culture in its original version. This sense of aestheticism, of appropriateness. And of the stage. Behind the turntables, they mix their tributes and move the packed halls on a very fine sound. They also have the audacity to never run out of ideas, and in 2015 they offered their first revisit of a song from the 70s, Le temps est bon. A success.

Their album Aller-Retour concentrates their DNA: it is composed of revisited songs from the 60s and 70s and original productions mixed with interviews. All elegantly arranged in 14 tracks. Bon Entendeur creates sounds that are new, that go back and forth with their inventive digital generation and the immense heritage of their predecessors. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bon+Entendeur"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The story of who was born into a totally Christian environment and who years later would become a pop music star. Muse of those who feel different or excluded, Katy Perry got her first guitar (from the church) at the age of thirteen and dreamed of it, as many young people do. The difference is that she did it. She broke free from the shackles of faith (without ever losing it) and set out to live through songs about her experiences. The result? Aside from Michael Jackson, only she was able to place five songs from the same album at the top of the charts.

 After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name 'Katy Perry' and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.

Perry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, One of the Boys, a pop rock record containing the controversial U.S number one song ""I Kissed a Girl"" and ""Hot n Cold"". Three subsequent albums have topped the U.S. Billboard 200. The disco-influenced Teenage Dream (2010) spawned five chart-topping U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles–""California Gurls"", ""Teenage Dream"", ""Firework"", ""E.T."", and ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"" — a record tying her with Michael Jackson's ""Bad"". Its follow-up record Prism (2013) was inspired by her divorce, and incorporates pop and dance along with themes of self-reflection, everyday life, and relationships. With the music videos for its chart-topping songs ""Roar"" and ""Dark Horse"", Perry became the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on Vevo.  Her 2017 electropop album,  'Witness' featured a political subtext and a theme of liberation. Her sixth studio album 'Smile' followed in 2020.

Perry has nine U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one singles and has received various awards, including four Guinness World Records, five Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award. She has been included in the annual Forbes lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011 to 2019. Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. Perry is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 18 million albums and 125 million singles worldwide. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled ""Katy Perry: Part of Me"" in 2012, and voiced Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs and its sequel in 2013. Her Super Bowl halftime show performance is the most watched in history. Perry also began serving as a judge on American Idol in 2018. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

169,red velvet,1112176,196442080,"There are three artists who go by Red Velvet:
1) k-pop
2) Italian musician
3) future funk

1) Red Velvet (레드벨벳) is a five-member South Korean girl group formed by SM Entertainment in 2014. The group consists of Irene (아이린), Seulgi (슬기), Wendy (웬디), Joy (조이), and Yeri (예리). Their name is a play on their dual concept of ""red"" and ""velvet;"" the ""red"" half is their brighter and bubblier side, while their ""velvet"" image is their softer, more mature and elegant concept.

Debuting in 2014, Red Velvet was originally a four-member group. Three of the original four members of Red Velvet were previously part of S.M. Entertainment's pre-debut team, SM Rookies. Seulgi, the first member who joined the agency, was brought in through an audition in 2007. Irene, the next member to join the company, was cast in 2009. Joy, the member who wasn't part of SM Rookies, auditioned through the SM Global Audition in Seoul in 2012. As part of SM Rookies, several clips of Irene and Seulgi were released on S.M. Entertainment's official YouTube account. The three members were rumored to debut as a group in July 2014, which was then later confirmed by SM Entertainment. With the addition of member Joy, the four-member group would debut as Red Velvet - SM Entertainment's first girl group in five years, after f(x).

Red Velvet's debut single ""행복 (Happiness)"" was digitally released on August 4, 2014. The music video was released on August 1, and later become the second most viewed K-pop video worldwide in August 2014; on the same day, the group made their official debut stage on the music program Music Bank.

Red Velvet released their second digital single ""Be Natural"" on October 13, 2014. It is a remake of a song by veteran SM Entertainment girl group, S.E.S.. The track features Taeyong, former member of SM Rookies' male unit named SR14B, as well as a member of NCT. The group started their promotional activities for this release on October 9, making their first appearance on the music program, M! Countdown. The music video for the song was released on the same day.

On March 11, 2015, SM Entertainment released a video announcing the addition of a new member to the group's lineup—Yeri. On March 14, ""Automatic,"" the group's first music video featuring Yeri, was released. The following day, they released their first mini-album ""Ice Cream Cake"", along with the music video for ""Ice Cream Cake."" It was also announced by S.M. Entertainment that both ""Automatic"" and ""Ice Cream Cake"" would be promoted as double lead singles of the album. 

In early September 2015, S.M. Entertainment announced that the group would be making a comeback, and on September 9, 2015, Red Velvet released their first full length album ""The Red"". The album features ten tracks, including the title track, ""Dumb Dumb."" The album focuses on their ""red"" image, which is supposed to be the group's bright and bold side. On December 18, 2015, the group took part in S.M. Entertainment's special winter project, Winter Garden, alongside label-mates f(x) and BoA, releasing a digital single titled ""세가지 소원 (Wish Tree).""

While promoting ""The Red"", it was hinted at by the members and S.M. Entertainment that there would be a follow up album, but nothing was confirmed at that time. In March 2016, it was announced that the group would make a comeback with the group's second mini album. ""The Velvet"" was released on March 17, 2016 as a direct follow up to their first album ""The Red"". While ""The Red' focuses on the ""red"" half of the group's image, ""The Velvet' focuses on the group's smooth and soft ""velvet"" image. The title track, ""7월 7일 (One Of These Nights),"" is described as an R&B ballad. On March 27, 2016, the group performed the track on music show Inkigayo.

On September 7, 2016, Red Velvet released their third mini-album ""Russian Roulette"". The mini album features seven tracks, including the title track of the same name, ""러시안 룰렛 (Russian Roulette)"". On September 13, 2016, Red Velvet took their first music show win for ""Russian Roulette"" on The Show. The title track peaked at #2 on the Gaon Digital Chart and Billboard's World Digital Songs chart, making it their highest rankings on both charts at the time. On January 27, 2018, the music video for ""Russian Roulette"" became the group's first music video to reach 100 million views.

All five tracks on the mini album debuted in the Top 50 of the Gaon Digital Chart.

Red Velvet revisited their ""velvet"" image by releasing their second full-length album ""Perfect Velvet"" on November 17, 2017 with the lead single ""Peek-a-Boo."" ""Peek-a-Boo"" peaked at #2 on Billboard's World Digital Songs chart. In South Korea, the album and the single ""Peek-a-Boo"" both charted at #2 on the Gaon Album Chart and Gaon Digital Chart. Through the release of Rookie, The Red Summer and Perfect Velvet all in the same year and the success of their albums overseas, Red Velvet achieved a ""top girl group"" status in South Korea in 2017. On January 29, 2018, Red Velvet released a repackage of their previous album titled ""The Perfect Red Velvet"", consisting of three new songs, including title track ""Bad Boy."" This was meant to be the most ""velvet"" track Red Velvet had ever put out.

On March 20, 2018, it was announced that Red Velvet would be performing alongside other selected South Korean artists for an inter-Korean concert in Pyongyang, North Korea. This makes them the first artist from SM Entertainment in fifteen years since Shinhwa to perform in North Korea.

The extended play debuted at #3 on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart and sold 26,124 copies on its first week of release in Japan.

On July 19, 2018, Red Velvet announced they would be making a comeback soon and had already filmed their music video outdoors in Gyeonggi-do. Excitement was stirred after the announcement of an English language version of previous single ""Bad Boy."" The songs from the new album were performed during Red Velvet's concert Redmare. They released their sixth extended play ""Summer Magic"" on August 6, 2018. The extended play contained seven tracks, including the title track ""Power Up"" and a bonus track of their popular song ""Bad Boy"" recorded in English. The album peaked at #1 on the Gaon Album Chart. 

After the release of ""Summer Magic"", news about Red Velvet's upcoming comeback circulated in October 2018, which SM Entertainment responded to by confirming a November comeback. SM Entertainment later revealed the details of the extended play along with the title of the lead single: ""RBB (Really Bad Boy)."" They also teased an English version of the title track to be added as a bonus track. RBB was released on November 30 as their seventh Korean extended play overall. 

On January 6, 2019, Red Velvet released their first Japanese digital single, titled ""Sappy."" The group released another Japanese single, ""Sayonara,"" on February 20. Both singles are included in their second Japanese EP, ""Sappy"", which was released on May 29; the EP also includes Japanese versions of ""Peek-a-Boo,"" ""Rookie,"" and ""Power Up,"" as well as a new song called ""Swimming Pool.""

In February, Red Velvet embarked on the North American leg of their Redmare Tour. They went on to hold shows in Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami, Chicago, and Newark in the United States and Toronto and Vancouver in Canada, becoming the first K-pop girl group to hold a North American tour in three years.

On April 5, Red Velvet were featured in a remixed version of ""Close to Me"" by Ellie Goulding and Diplo, with Yeri and Wendy contributing Korean lyrics to the song.

On June 19, Red Velvet released their sixth Korean EP, titled ""The ReVe Festival: Day 1"", which topped the Gaon Album Chart and features the lead single ""Zimzalabim."" It is the first entry of The ReVe Festival trilogy. The group's seventh Korean EP, The ReVe Festival: Day 2 and its lead single ""Umpah Umpah"" arrived on August 20. The summery single received a Song of the Year Daesang (Grand Prize) at the 2019 Asia Artist Awards on November 26. To promote The ReVe Festival, the group embarked on their third tour, La Rouge, which began in Seoul on November 23 and 24. The third and final entry of the trilogy, ""The ReVe Festival: Finale"" was a compilation of the previous two EPs and contained four new songs, including the chart-topping lead single ""Psycho."" This would be the group's latest comeback for over a year.

On July 6, 2020, the group's first sub-unit was formed. Red Velvet - Irene & Seulgi released their first mini album with ""Monster"" as the title track. The album also featured a solo song for the group's lead vocalist, Seulgi. On July 19, they dropped a single titled ""Naughty."" It was remixed soon afterwards.

On January 1, 2021, their company, SM Entertainment, hosted the Culture Humanity free online concert featuring many of their artists. Red Velvet returned as five after the member Wendy had been on hiatus for a year because of injuries and Irene had been absent for weeks due to controversy. The group preformed songs including ""Peek-a-Boo"" and ""Bad Boy."" The long-anticipated five-member performance of their hit track ""Psycho"" was also performed.

Before the group returned as five, Wendy was announced to be debuting as a solo artist. On April 5, 2021,  ""Like Water"" was released, which included two lead singles: ""Like Water"" and ""When This Rain Stops.""

Member Joy also debuted as a solo artist with a title track and remake album titled ""Hello"". It released on May 31, 2021.

The five-member group's long-anticipated 6th mini-album ""Queendom"" was released on August 17, 2021. The title track ""Queendom"" was described as ""a pop dance song with the message that we are all 'queens' of our lives, and that together we shine more beautifully.""

Their first release of 2022, ""Feel My Rhythm,"" was released on March 21, marking the return of The ReVe Festival. The mini album consisted of 6 songs, the title track sampling ""Aria on the G String."" The song effortlessly mixes elegant classical music with a modern, upbeat pop sound.

As the third member of the group to debut solo, Seulgi released her first EP  ""28 Reasons,"" on October 4, 2022, alongside the title track of the same name.

The group has been endlessly praised for their diverse concepts and uniqueness. In November 2019, Billboard crowned Red Velvet as ""the best idol group alive."" The group has now surpassed their tenth anniversary, and Red Velvet continues to captivate and gain recognition domestically and around the world from their fans, ReVeluv (레벨업), as well as casual listeners alike.

180,jagger finn,499212,7542237,"Jagger Finn, a bedroom pop musician hailing from Los Angeles and based in New York, has been releasing music since 2015. Beyond his primary moniker, Jagger Finn has also released music as oakjoi and Finn Luca. Oakjoi is the URL of his Soundcloud account and Finn Luca seems to be what he used to share music under around 2017.

Jagger Finn's music is characterized by an indie sensibility, reflected not only in his sound but also in his enigmatic distribution method. Jagger Finn has cultivated an unconventional approach to music dissemination, which has sparked curiosity among his followers. Despite being a popular artist, his discography remains elusive and challenging to uncover. Only three songs remain on his Spotify, along with occasional Soundcloud reuploads.

Sacrificing the allure of financial gain and widespread recognition, he employs an obscure and transient mode of releasing audio files. This approach fosters an air of mystery around his complete discography, leaving enthusiasts guessing about the numerous tracks that might have slipped into obscurity under titles like ""v.7,"" ""019,"" and ""pollux8.""

The majority of Jagger Finn's work remains shrouded in enigma, often bearing cryptic titles that pose challenges for seekers. Employing numbers, dates, or even seemingly random phrases, his song titles contribute to the sense of hidden treasure. Certain tracks exhibit a sequential naming convention, necessitating the discernment of patterns to unveil the sequence.

Despite the unpredictable cadence of his releases, Jagger Finn consistently introduces new music. However, many of these releases are swiftly retracted, sometimes available for only a few hours. This intriguing practice intermittently leads to the rediscovery of his creations, which may resurface after months or even years.

The demo for ""Please"" was released on Halloween of 2015, signifying one of Jagger Finn's early contributions. A distinct project from this period is the 2016 album named ""disparu,"" released under an alternate alias. This album bears the hallmark of sample-rich lo-fi hip hop interwoven with a distinct jazz influence. Jagger Finn adeptly integrates vintage samples, contributing to the album's unique character.

Speculated to have been released between the years 2016 and 2018, an untitled album surfaced briefly before being removed. This work notably embraced an acoustic sound palette.

In January of 2018, Jagger Finn unveiled an album titled ""drafts"" on his now-inactive Bandcamp platform. One of his singles, ""Triplbt Theme,"" premiered on August 28, 2019, remaining as his sole Spotify release to date. ""Vas,"" recognized as his most prominent hit, has garnered over 235 million streams.

Amidst his catalog, Jagger Finn released the album ""Technoviolet"" in 2021; however, this offering was promptly retracted shortly after its release. The single ""violet"" made its debut on December 12, 2022, marking a recent addition to his musical repertoire. His latest release on Soundcloud, ""AUDIO 1214TEST3,"" was unveiled on December 20, 2022.

1) Kim Seok-jin was scouted by Big Hit Entertainment for his looks while walking down the street. At the time Kim was studying acting and had no background in music. On June 13, 2013, Kim made his debut as one of the four vocalists in BTS with their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool. Kim released his first co-produced track, a solo single from the album Wings titled ""Awake"", in 2016. The song peaked at number 31 on the Gaon Music Chart and six on the Billboard World Digital Singles Chart. In December 2016, he released a Christmas version of ""Awake"" on SoundCloud.

On August 9, 2018, the second solo by Kim, ""Epiphany"", was released as a trailer for BTS' then-upcoming compilation album Love Yourself: Answer. The song was described as a ""building pop-rock melody"" by Billboard and contains lyrics discussing self-acceptance and self-love.

He accepted and was then part of the Ruff Ryder family and his first album on the Ruff Ryder label.

Jin is also working on a project where he is planning on releasing a Cantonese album called ""ABC Jin"", where ABC stands for American Born Chinese. The album will be released internationally and ""ABC Jin"" will be rapped in all Cantonese.

Jin's style of rapping consists of strong punchlines, and used this skill in the battles he won. His punchlines hardly ever uses metaphors that require much thought to decipher, and his bars are clean cut and powerful when used in battles. Such battles against Verse, Shells, RK, and his 106 & Park battles are great examples of his style of rapping and battling.

187,alfa,52281,1190966,"There are several musicians with a name ""Alfa""

1. Alfa - a New York-based folk/pop/acoustic singer/songwriter and musician.

2. Alfa  - a trance artist.

3. AlFa - a post-rock duo from Strasbourg, France.

4. ALFA - a dreamwave/synth producer and artist, part of the Binary Collective from Los Angeles, California.

5. Alfa - a screamo band.

1. Alfa was born to a family that more than dabbled a bit in music. Some say she was born on a tree in the jungles of Mindanao, but those privvy to her life pre-cross-Pacific days know full well she was born in a tiny white hospital, and that she first learned piano from a strict Madame who would not let her exercise self-made renditions of “Mary Had a Little Lamb” during lessons. Her mother played the piano and the organ, her grandfather played the guitar by ear, her grandmother taught piano, and her aunts played the clarinet and the flute (they would soon become church organists, each married to pastors). Annoyed at what she saw as the norm, Alfa swore she would never become a musician. In fact, she first wanted to become a dentist.

Now 21, Alfa has relented to her musical fate. A singer/songstress since the age of 13, having cut her first demo at 15 and now a seasoned performer all over the venues of Manhattan (CBGBs, The Cutting Room, Arlene’s Grocery, Sidewalk Café, Rockwood Music Hall, Union Square, to name a few) Alfa has been around the figurative musical block with her start as a classical pianist under Dr. Raul Sunico, then a violinist in various orchestras including the Children’s Orchestra Society of H.T. Ma (Yo-Yo Ma’s pops), before finding her niche as a songwriter using a blend of her classical and church background and self-taught guitar and piano skillz (with a Z, heck yeah). At 17, she performed her song, ""I Believe"" with a full symphony orchestra at the Denver Center for Performing Arts and Lefrak Hall in Queens College under the direction of Michael Dadap. In addition to her extensive repertoire of ballads, laments, and pseudo-rock melodies, she has written music for plays, films and dabbled in acapella arrangements and performances with her childhood musician friends.

Alfa is inspired by everything: from first loves and intriguing faces, to the idiosyncracies of the number Pi. She is super thankful for the music and musicians that have perpetually surrounded her life, in spite of her initial disdain toward the sacred art. She will graduate Magna Cum Laude from NYU in May 2007 (finalement!). Alfa loves maps, New York City, ballet flats and Vera Wang perfume.

She has a four-song EP entitled ""Growth"" (currently available on iTunes), which she worked on with Dan Coutant at The Buddy Project thebuddyproject.com (Sufjan Stevens, Asthmatic Kitty).

Currently, she is working on a full length album with producer Alex Houton (who also produced Charlotte Sometimes), which will be full of new songs that will showcase her diverse tastes and talents in music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Alfa"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Beyoncé performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child and rose to fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of Destiny's Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Beyoncé herself is the best-selling black female musician of all time and second best-selling female artist of all time, behind only Madonna. With 35 wins and 99 nominations from the Grammy Awards for her music (including her work in Destiny's Child and The Carters), she is the most-awarded and most-nominated artist in Grammy history.

189,vanessa paradis,530911,6297186,"
Vanessa Chantal Paradis (born December 22, 1972 in Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, France) is a French singer and actress.
 
She was discovered on the TV show L'École des fans in 1980. She recorded her first single La Magie des surprises-parties in 1985. Although it was not a hit, it paved the way for the song with which she would become internationally famous - ""Joe le taxi"" in 1987, while she was still only 14 years old. It was #1 in France for 11 weeks and, unusually for a song sung in French, was released in the United Kingdom the following year, where it reached #3. It was taken from her first album M&J (it stands for Marilyn & John) which, although it gained a number 13 placing in France, drew little attention in the UK and did not chart.
 
In 1992, now 19 and working in the United States with rock musician Lenny Kravitz, who was her boyfriend for a while, Paradis began work on a new album sung in English, in which she had become fluent. Written and produced by Kravitz, the album, titled Vanessa Paradis, topped the French chart and briefly made the UK listings (number 45). One of the singles from it was Be My Baby, which made number 5 in France and gave her another Top 10 UK hit (number 6). She has since appeared in several films, most famously ""Noce Blanche"", for which she won the 1990 César Award for Most Promising Actress; 1999's La fille sur le pont (aka Girl on the Bridge), which became an arthouse box office hit in the United States; and 2004's Mon Ange.
 
Paradis currently released a new album (Divinidylle). There are three versions (regular, limited edition, and the Christmas edition). She started the Divinidylle tour in October. Some concerts were filmed and the DVD/CD of the tour was just recently released. Her latest film DVD release is La Clef. Also, Vanessa recently won two Les Victoires de la Musique awards for her new album Divinidylle. Some of her next projects include a greatest hits cd which includes the commercial jingle ""I love Paris in the Springtime"" as well as the movies ""The Midwife Crisis"" and ""Un monstre à Paris April"" which will be released in 2010.
Vanessa Paradis has been in a relationship with American actor Johnny Depp since 1998. They have a daughter, Lily-Rose Melody Depp (born 27 May 1999), and a son, John Christopher ""Jack"" Depp III (born 9 April 2002[3]).

191,lykke li,2696228,81949061,"Li Lykke Timotej Zachrisson (born on March 18, 1986) is a Swedish singer, songwriter and model from Stockholm. She is known for her blend of indie pop, dream pop, and electronic music. She grew up in a creatively and musically supportive environment; her mother, Kärsti Stiege, was a photographer and former member of the band Tant Strul, while her father, Johan Zachrisson, was a musician in the Swedish reggae/progg band Dag Vag. Her brother, Zacharias Zachrisson, also pursued a music career. The family moved frequently, living in Stockholm, Portugal, Nepal, and India, which exposed her to a variety of cultural and musical influences from a young age. These experiences would later inform her music style and creative outlook.

At 19, Lykke Li spent several months in Brooklyn, New York, immersing herself in the local music scene before returning to Sweden. She went back to Brooklyn two years later at age 21 to record her debut album, Youth Novels, which was released in Sweden on January 30, 2008. Produced by Björn Yttling of the band Peter Bjorn and John along with Lasse Mårtén, Youth Novels gained international acclaim for its confessional lyrics and minimalistic production. It was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland in June 2008 and in the United States on August 19. Her single ""Little Bit"" from the album captured widespread attention, gaining praise from the indie community and the music site Stereogum, which described her style as a blend of soul, electro, and “powdered-sugar pop.”

Building on the success of her debut, Lykke Li continued to release music that explored themes of love, heartache, and introspection. Her follow-up albums, Wounded Rhymes in 2011 and I Never Learn in 2014, showcased a more mature, emotionally charged sound, with Wounded Rhymes earning her two Swedish Grammy Awards for Artist of the Year and Album of the Year in 2012. Alongside her solo career, she collaborated with prominent artists like Kleerup and Röyksopp, lending her vocals to the tracks ""Until We Bleed,"" ""Miss It So Much,"" and ""Were You Ever Wanted."" Her growing popularity led to notable appearances on shows like Conan and Skavlan in early 2011, helping her reach an even broader audience.

In 2016, Lykke Li co-founded the band LIV alongside members of Miike Snow and Peter Bjorn and John, further expanding her creative pursuits. Two years later, she released her fourth album, So Sad So Sexy (2018), marking a shift towards a more mainstream pop sound infused with late-2010s production influences. Her 2022 album, Eyeye, saw her return to a more introspective and sonically experimental approach, once again showcasing her characteristic blend of melancholic lyrics and innovative production. Over her career, Lykke Li has built a reputation for her sensuous, ethereal vocals and innovative musical style, solidifying her place as a significant figure in contemporary indie pop and electronic music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lykke+Li"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

193,duster,1271271,92656981,"Duster is a slowcore band from San Jose, California formed in 1996 with an initial lineup of Clay Parton and Canaan Amber, former members of bands Calm and Mohinder. They are known for their unique lo-fi sound, recording their music onto cassette decks and similar equipment at their home studio nicknamed Low Earth Orbit.

The duo released two demo tapes in the same year as their formation, Christmas Dust and On The Dodge. In 1997, they released their debut 7"" EP Transmission, Flux via Up Records. The band briefly recorded under the moniker Valium Aggelein, releasing Dweller on the Threshold as a cassette tape that same year, alongside Hier kommt der schwartze Mond in 1998.

Jason Albertini joined the band during the recording of their debut album Stratosphere, playing drums on three tracks. The album was released by Up Records in February  1998, being followed by the Apex, Trance-Like 7"" EP via Smooth Lips Records that same year. By the release of the 1975 EP in 1999 and their second studio album Contemporary Movement, Albertini had become more involved in the group's creative process and became a permament member of the band. 

By 2000, Duster had become inactive and went on hiatus. In an interview, Clay Parton stated that ""When we originally paused around 2000, it was because of me. I went through a breakup, and I had a new baby, so I had to figure out to provide for this tiny person. A band was just not a priority anymore. So the other guys moved to Seattle, everyone was just kind of their own satellite for a while."" Duster had reconvened in 2004, expanding their lineup to include guitarist Krag and bassist Ross Peard. They announced that they had began working on new material, but were ultimately unsatisfied with the results and left it unfinished. The band had dissolved by 2005.

After Duster's dissolution, Albertini and Amber went on to form the experimental band Helvetia in 2005. Parton released his debut album Birds in the Ground under his solo alias Eiafuawn (short for ""Everything Is All Fucked Up And What Not"") the same year. Amber also released the self-titled EP Canaan Amber in 2010.

Duster announced their return on Instagram in 2018 with the simple message ""hi. it's been a long time but we are recording a little bit."" In January 2019, Numero Group announced Capsule Losing Contact, a boxset reissue of their complete discography, alongside unreleased material. The boxset was released in March. The band's first studio album in 19 years, the self-titled Duster, was released in December 2019 via Muddguts Records. 

In April 2022, the band surprise-released Together, their fourth studio album. Clay Parton announced via his forum Stereobird that ""jason is not a part of duster anymore and he's not on this record and no one should be reading anything at all into that because we all love each other still and forever..."", asking fans to also support Helvetia's recent output.

In 2023, Numero Group released Remote Echoes, an archival release compiling the band's widely-bootlegged demo material.

207,cordae,690903,19428544,"Cordae Amari Dunston (born August 26, 1997), known mononymously as Cordae (formerly known as YBN Cordae and Entendre is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. 

Dunston gained popularity by releasing remixes of popular songs, such as ""My Name Is"" by Eminem, and ""Old N***as"" which was a response to the song ""1985"" by J. Cole. Videos to both remixes were uploaded to the WorldStarHipHop's YouTube channel, which led to an immense and immediate positive response from both mainstream media and the online rap community. His debut studio album, The Lost Boy was released on July 26, 2019 and received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 62nd Grammy Awards. Cordae was a member of the YBN collective from 2018 until the group disbanded in 2020.

Dunston was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, but moved to Suitland, Maryland. As a young child, he'd taken an interest in music as his father would always play classic hip hop around him, from artists such as Rakim, Nas, Big L, and Talib Kweli. He began writing raps around the age of fifteen, but did not take it seriously, as it was only a hobby for him. Following the influence he gained from the music his father listened to, he would do research on certain artists through YouTube, attempting to find similar music and ""getting lost"" in the recommended videos section. Dunston began gaining more interest in pursuing a rap career as he aged, but focused on his education first, although writing lyrics often distracted him from his studies. He released three mixtapes as a teenager under the name ""Entendre"" – Anxiety (2014), I’m So Anxious (2016), and I’m So Anonymous (2017). He graduated from high school in 2015 and decided to go to college at Towson University, later dropping out in 2018, explaining that college was ""bigger than him"" as a first-generation student, and he was mainly doing it for his mother.

Nahmir had taken interest in a song that Dunston had made with fellow rapper and brother Simba, and reached out to him. Dunston is the only member of YBN that hadn't been introduced to everyone as a gamer, as he doesn't take gaming too seriously. He already felt like he was a part of YBN, the only thing that hadn't solidified his presence being his social media handles, which he soon changed from Entendre to YBN Cordae. He also stated that Entendre had been a name that he'd wanted to change for while, stating ""I was just always around Nahmir and shit, those were just like my brothers... And, I was thinking, yo, I need to change my shit to like, Cordae, and shit, my actual first name. I was already ""YBN"" without the social tag, you know what I'm saying?"" He released his first single, which he called his ""introduction to the world"", in May 2018. It was a remix of the 1999 song ""My Name Is"" by Eminem, which he released along with a music video via WorldStarHipHop on YouTube. Subsequently, he released ""Old N***as"", as a response to ""1985"" by J. Cole, then released the tracks Fighting Temptations and Kung Fu, respectively.

His debut live performance was at the annual Rolling Loud music festival in May 2018, in which he performed with both YBN Nahmir and Almighty Jay. He performed with the duo again for the 2018 XXL Freshman Show in New York City, after Nahmir was announced to be an inductee of the yearly freshman class.

214,damas gratis,71318,1111938,"Damas Gratis es un grupo musical de cumbia villera. Desde su salida, obtienen un éxito con su primer CD, al que titularon ""Para los pibes"", llevándolos a los mejores rankins de la cumbia en Argentina, Paraguay y Chile y popularizando el estilo de ""cumbia villera"" con el tema ""Se te ve la tanga"". Recientemente ya llegaron a presentarse en Mexico especialmente en Monterrey donde realizaron bailes masivos logrando en el auditorio coca cola un lleno impresionante de alrrededor de 20,000 personas y en el lugar de origen de la cumbia, Colombia, siendo el primer grupo argentino del genero de cumbia villera en trascender tanto internacionalmente.

La banda fue creada por Pablo Lescano. Anteriormente Pablo había integrado la prestigiosa banda Amar Azul en calidad de teclista. También fue el creador, el compositor y el alma del primer grupo de ""cumbia villera"" de Argentina Flor de Piedra, aunque no participó como músico en ella. Quién si lo hizo fue Romina Lescano, su hermana, que luego lo acompañó en Damas Gratis.

El estilo que empezó a asomar con Flor de Piedra alcanzó el máximo de profesionalismo con Damas Gratis. Hizo explosión y se consolidó en un indiscutible éxito relegando decenas de imitaciones a rol secundario.

Damas Gratis, sin letras románticas, melodías melosas ni carilindos colocó nuevamente a nuestra música tropical en los más variados sectores sociales, logro alcanzado por muy pocos grupos en la historia de la movida tropical.

La música y el ritmo de Damas Gratis continuó avanzando hasta trascender los límites de la música tropical, así lo reflejan diversos artículos publicados en diarios líderes en sus respectivos países como ser: Clarín, La Nación, El País, Buenos Aires Herald y revistas como Noticias o Rolling Stone, que también se ocuparon de este fenómeno que revolucionó la movida tropical y a la vez ubicó en los canales de televisión un rico debate alrededor de la cultura de las villas.


 Música de películas  [editar]Las melodías de Pablo Lescano siguen rompiendo fronteras culturales, ya que el filme del argentino Pablo Trapero ""El Bonaerense"", llegó a Francia al ""Festival de Cine de Cannes"" y su banda de sonido es de Pablo Lescano con ""Damas Gratis"". Este material es un símbolo además de la integración: una rareza para el “culto” como para el cumbiambero (banda de sonido ""El Bonaerense"").

Pablo Lescano: Voz y Teclado.
Romina Lescano: Coros.
Gabriel Alza: Animación.
Edgar Gómez: Guitarra.

233,benee,851853,17920445,"Stella Bennett (born January 30, 2000), known professionally as Benee (/ˈbɛniː/, stylized BENEE, formerly spelled Bene) is a New Zealand musician from Grey Lynn in Auckland.

Stella Rose Bennett was born and raised in the suburb of Grey Lynn in Auckland. She grew up in a ""really musical"" family with parents who would expose her to the catalogs of Radiohead, Björk, and Groove Armada. From the age of eight, BENEE began taking guitar lessons in primary school before starting saxophone lessons in high school. Eventually, BENEE dropped all music in order to prioritize water polo. She claims it ""was [her] life"" and that she at one point hoped to represent New Zealand competitively. BENEE later became interested in writing and recording music at the age of 17, after deciding that she did not want to pursue a career in water polo. BENEE attended an all-girls Catholic school, St. Mary's College, where music was compulsory for four years.

BENEE began her music career by posting covers to SoundCloud and began making her own music in her final year of high school. After dropping out of a communications degree at the Auckland University of Technology after two weeks, during what she called ""a quarter-life crisis"", she decided to enter the music business professionally. Her music caught the attention of Josh Fountain, a producer and member of the band Leisure, with whom she produced two singles: ""Tough Guy"", released in 2017, and ""Soaked"", released in 2018. she earned her first career entry on the Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2018 with ""Soaked"" at #58.

In both 2019 and 2020, she consecutively won Single of the Year, Best Solo Artist and Best Pop Artist at the New Zealand Music Awards. BENEE initially gained local prominence with her singles ""Glitter"" and ""Soaked"", before her 2019 single ""Supalonely"" saw international popularity following its success on the video-sharing platform TikTok and YouTube. BENEE subsequently released her debut album, Hey U X, in November 2020.

Under the moniker of Bene, she made her solo debut with the 2017 single ""Tough Guy"", before later gaining prominence with her 2018 single ""Soaked"", which has been certified double-platinum in New Zealand. She released her debut EP, Fire on Marzz, with help from producer Josh Fountain in June 2019. Her second EP, Stella & Steve, was released in November 2019 and charted in the US, Canada, and France as a result of the international success of the EP's final single, ""Supalonely"". Since 2018, BENEE has earned five entries on the Triple J Hottest 100, three of which were in the 2019 list. She also released her third EP, Lychee, in March 2022 which charted at number 13 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart.

In an interview for The New Zealand Herald, Benee revealed that she has dyslexia. She also described her childhood experiences with songwriting:

""throughout school I struggled with writing....I liked creative writing, that was what I loved, but I was always making mistakes, and I was confined to this way that I should write....Songwriting for me was this place where I don't have to be grammatically correct. Learning the craft with [Josh Fountain], when he was sharing all his knowledge – something clicked, and I was just like, I love this. It's a great emotional outlet for me; I just love splashing what I feel on to a track."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/benee"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Rodriquez ""Jacquees"" Broadnax was born April 15, 1994 in Atlanta, GA. He found his passion for both singing and dancing at the age of 9 with influences from The Jackson's: An American Dream and The Temptations movies; imitating no less than the greatest. Jacquees participated in his first talent show in fifth grade at Canby Lane Elementary School performing the Jackson 5's, ""I Want You Back,"" winning 1st place. He successfully matriculated to Mary McCleod Bethune Middle School where he continued to compete in talent shows winning every year; two at Bethune Middle and one at the Dekalb County Middle School Talent Show. 

In 2007, Jacquees was introduced to his manager, Orlando Grind, by Dexx Lee. After years of performing in local talent shows, Orlando soon introduced him to Russell ""Block"" Spencer, founder and CEO of Block Entertainment. When Jacquees started going to the studio he merely blended with the team and wasn't given the opportunity to express his true talents. ""When you see work being done around you but not for you, you tend to get discouraged,"" says Jacquees. At that time, Block's focus was only rap, not R&B. It wasn't until summer of 2009 when Block witnessed how talented Jacquees was and shifted his vision. Jacquees began to work closely with Block Entertainment recording and gaining more exposure with the release of his first single ""Krazy"" featuring Grand Hustle's own, T.I. 

Jacquees has recorded with label mates, Gorilla Zoe and Scotty, T.I.P, and an upcoming Atlanta rapper, J-Real. Jacquees dreams to work with established artist Lil Wayne, Drake, Justin Bieber, Bow Wow, Lil' Chuckee, Chris Brown, and many more. ""All of these artists started out at the age I am and are successful in the industry. I look up to them and dream that I will be just as successful as they are,"" Jacquees explains. ""Only better!"" 

""It's truly a blessing to have the opportunity to work with the artist and producers I have already worked with,"" says Jacquees. ""I pray to God every night that I continue on this journey and achieve what I've always dreamed of doing. With God on my side, I know this is only the beginning and there is more to come."" With that in mind, Jacquees will achieve any and everything he wants out of the music industry.

255,radwimps,542780,29931504,"Radwimps is a Japanese rock band that formed in their first year of highschool in 2001 in Kanagawa, Japan. They play an eccentric mix of rock, punk, funk and jazz. The band achieved great commercial success in 2006 with their album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, and are best known for their later singles ""Order Made"" (2008) and ""Dada"" (2011), both of which hit number one on Oricon's single charts.

The five original members had been friends since middle school. Vocalist Yojiro Noda first became interested in music after hearing Oasis in middle school, when he would try to remember the guitar chords and sing to Oasis songs. He was asked to become the vocalist by a friend, and originally band activities were balanced with basketball. The band's name was formed from two English language slang terms, rad and wimp. According to the band, the coined word had several meanings, including ""excellent weakling"" and ""superlative coward.""

The band's activities began centred around Yokohama, with the band performing their first live at live house BB Street in Yokohama's Kannai district on February 5, 2002. At this point, guitarist Akira Kuwahara dropped out of high school in order to focus on the band. In September and August 2002, the band partook in the Yokohama High School Music Festival, and eventually won the grand prize for the competition with the song ""Moshi mo."" ""Moshi mo"" was released as the band's debut single in May 2003, with 10,000 copies pressed and sold for 100 yen each. Following this single, the band toured the Yokohama area, including a performance as the sole act at Yokohama's Club 24West. The band released their debut album Radwimps in July through independent label Newtraxx, featuring songs written by the band in middle school. The following August, after a guest appearance at the Yokohama High School Music Festival, the band went on hiatus for Noda and other members to focus on their school exams.

Radwimps returned from hiatus in March 2004, however members Kei Asō, Yūsuke Saiki and Akio Shibafumi did not decide to resume band activities. An audition was not held for new members, instead, acquaintances to the band members, drummer Satoshi Yamaguchi and bassist Yusuke Takeda, were added to the group without the members even having their skills trialled. Takeda met the band members in August 2003 as a member of a different band performing in the Yokohama High School Music Festival. The band immediately began recording songs, and by July released a second single, ""Kiseki,"" and performed a three month Japan-wide tour. Immediately after the end of the tour, the band started work on their second album, Radwimps 2: Hatten Tojō, which was finalized by the end of the year and released in March.

Directly after the release, the band departed on a five month tour, Radwimps Haruna Tour (はるなっTOUR?), and also performed at high profile summer music festivals, such as Setstock, Rock in Japan and Summer Sonic. During this time, the band released a third single, ""Hexun / Kanashi,"" which was the band's first charting release.

In November, the band made their major debut single under Toshiba EMI with the single ""Nijūgoko-me no Senshokutai,"" followed by ""EDP (Tonde Hi ni Iru Natsu no Kimi)"" in January, both top 50 singles. In shifting to a major label, Noda explained that the band took the same stance as they had as an independent band, and that ""If we thought we were bigger on a major label, that would have been a big mistake."" The band's third and first major label album, Radwimps 3: Mujintō ni Motte Ikiwasureta Ichimai in March 2006, was a landmark in establishing their popularity, debuting at number 13 on Oricon's album charts. Radwimps 3 saw a change in the band's musical style, allowing the band to be more experimental in their sound.

By the end of 2006 the band's popularity had exponentially grown: the band's album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, lead with the top 20 singles ""Futarigoto"" and ""Yūshinron"" and top five ""Setsuna Rensa,"" debuted at number five and had an initial shipment of more than 100,000 copies. In this time, the band's older releases, such as Radwimps, Radwimps 2 and ""Kiseki"" began charting for the first time and continued to for extended periods, Radwimps even eventually being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. In the next three years, both Radwimps and Radwimps 2 charted for approximately 100 weeks, and as of early 2011, Radwimps 3 and Radwimps 4 still continue to chart.

In 2008, the band received their first number one single, with ""Order Made"", on the Oricon charts. Their 2009 album Altocolony no Teiri sold around 213,000 copies in its first week, debuting at number 2 on the Oricon charts. The band received their second Oricon number one single ""Dada"" in 2011.

The band gained renewed notoriety in 2016 when they provided the soundtrack for the Makoto Shinkai film ""Kimi no Na wa. (Your Name.)"", which went on to become the highest-grossing anime film in history. One of the four vocal tracks, ""Zenzenzense"", was a #1 hit in Japan. The partnership continued when Radwimps provided the soundtrack for Shinkai's 2019 film ""Weathering With You"".

But the British-Australian songwriter—born Ruel Vincent van Dijk in 2002—has also been working at it for a sizable chunk of his life. Ruel was on the precipice of his teenage years when his dad sent a demo of him doing a James Bay tune to producer M-Phazes (Demi Lovato, Eminem) in 2015, kickstarting his run as one of 21st-century pop’s foremost purveyors of feels. His debut EP, 2018’s Ready, proved that he was exactly that—before even becoming a legal adult, Ruel built a record packed with well-crafted, R&B-inflected, chart-ready songs. The breezy rhythm of “Dazed & Confused” is juxtaposed with the heartbreak that staccato strings set front and centre for the throbbing chorus; and “Younger”, with its sugary vocal hooks, bouncy piano and gospel singers, softens the blow of a story about friends growing apart over time. In 2020, his music continued to mature with Bright Lights, Red Eyes. Using a stream-of-consciousness writing style, Ruel’s bedroom-pop vulnerability shines through on songs like the rousing “courage”, creating a tenderness and intimacy that’s impressive for an artist of any age. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ruel"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Davido was born in Atlanta GA, USA on November 21st to Mr And Mrs Adeleke and attended The British International School, Lagos. Travelling between the USA, the UK and Nigeria, Davido has experienced different cultures but still stays true to his roots and this is evident in his music and the people he considers his biggest influences musically, which include Don Jazzy, 2 Face idibia, Sound Sultan and Wande Coal. Though Davido started music professionally a year ago, he has been performing and making music since the age of 11. Now 18, he has set up a record label called HKN Music, jointly ownedby Davido and Ade, his older brother. The saying “If you want something done, do it yourself” is what led the brothers start the label as Davido believes that as a producer and recording artiste, he would be in the best position to create music that suits his style. When asked to choose an ideal producer to work with, he responded “...myself, because I knowwhat I want exactly!” He is however quick to mention that he would definitely be excited to work with Sarz, Jaysleek and/or Don Jazzy.
In a short space of time, Davido has developed a huge fan base (14 to 28-year-olds) in Nigeria, the US and the UK and the young fresh talent’s first  single “Back When” featuring Naeto C, is enjoying massive media attention and airplay online, on radio and TV.

Within no time Davido took us by storm when he released Dami Duro , which has been said to be one of Nigerians top hits ever made. Without a doubt, Dami Duro has become a leading club song as well as one of radios most played.

The Artiste
Davido admits that his love for entertaining people comes from his late mother who passed away in 2003. Losing his mother has been the most traumatic experience Davido has had to suffer but it has also been his inspiration as he states “...she’s the reason I do what I do.... she loved to entertain and I plan on carrying that legacy...”

The Producer
As a versatile artiste, Davido is able to adapt to any beat produced by other producers. However, this is a craft he has succeeded in mastering and with help from his brother Ade, HKN Studios would be a force to reckon with in the Nigerian Music scene.
Often asked where his inspiration as a producer comes from, David explains “... I like it when people are happy and when they can dance to my music! My mom liked to dance to music and I am inspired when I think of the kind of beats that would make her dance”
His debut single “Back When” featuring Naeto C is a testament to Davido’s ability and skill as a producer. He has also produced music for ... Naeto C, Skales, Tiwa Savage and Sauce Kid. So, the next time you are dancing to a well made beat, pay attention because you might just hear “on the beat its Davido”... A signature that will be heard on chart-topping songs for a very long time!
The Student
Often considered playful and fun loving, Davido has shown that he is a focused individual and not allowing his music career get in the way of his education. Davido is currently studying Business Administrations in Babcock University and he is applying things he learns in school into running the business of his music career. Ensuring that a proper system and business tools are in place for his music career, Davido hasnot only built a recording studio for the HKN Records, he has also assembled a management and PR team to help him run his affairs while he focuses on his education. Music doesn’t take a back seat though... Davido runs on a very tight schedule to ensure that neither his music nor education suffers!
The Brand
Good talent is hard to go unnoticed. However, more profitable than good talent is a good brand. The Davido brand is increasing growing and commanding attention.

It was revealed that the extended play was mostly composed and produced by the members themselves.

2. Seventeen were an Indonesian pop group with a close fan following in eastern Asia. The band is perhaps best known for the 2008 tune ""Selalu Mengalah"", which came from Seventeen's third album Lelaki Hebat.

272,bohemia,18524,230620,"There are at least three artists with this name:

* The first is a Pakistani-American rapper:

Roger David (Punjabi: راجر ڈیوڈ), better known by his stage name Bohemia is a Pakistani-American rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer. Bohemia was born in Karachi, Sindh and received his education in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. At the age of 13, he moved to the United States with his family.

In his early teens, Ra (short for Raja) arrived with his family in America, settling in San Francisco’s Mission District. Within their first month on the block, Ra witnessed a young man get murdered over five dollars. The killer was the man’s brother in law. This would be Ra’s first lesson on trusting others in the streets of Pardes (the foreign land). Although he had strong knowledge and passion for writing music, he made it a second priority, and began hanging on the street corners to run drugs for local hustlers.

The streets became a priority to Ra, but he would occasionally play keyboards at local Desi events. Through this platform, he gained recognition in the Desi music community. But what struck people most was his ability to write songs or poetry, mostly in Urdu and Punjabi.

He was offered a lucrative job at a Sacramento based recording studio and he decided to follow his passion. Ra packed his bags and left his family behind to become a full time musician.

Along with a crew of other musicians, Ra was now spending his days on the road, playing gigs throughout the US and Canada, sleeping in cars and on recording studio floors. It would be through this experience that Ra would learn about stage presence.

As the youngest member of the musical family, Ra came to consider them his older brothers, but as certain members became entangled in hard drugs, the crew fell apart.
It was at this point that Ra, still a teenager, decided to go his separate way. Again, he packed his bags, this time to join his cousin in Oakland.

Oakland, CA. A city known for both it’s abundance of independent rap labels and it’s uncontrollable murder rate. Devastated by the loss of his friend and heavily influenced by his friends in Oakland, Ra began to loose focus on his music and indulge in heavy drugs, crime and women. He spent his days hanging in the streets and moving drugs across the 680 and 880 interstate.

Yet and still, Ra would be delivered an opportunity which would draw him back to his true passion. His cousin was working on a West Oakland recording studio, when he introduced him to a young hip hop producer called Sha One. Sha was in the process of setting up his own label. He was looking for an artist who had a strong presence both live and on record and he saw this in Ra. He flipped out when he heard Ra reciting something he’d written in Punjabi, and asked him to rap it over one of his beats. Ra has never rapped seriously before, but when he did, it was as if he’d found the perfect expressive medium for his writing.

Over the next few months, Ra wrote a library of lyrics. This would become arsenal for his debut album Vich Pardesan De (In The Foreign Land) – an autobiographical story of his life as a Desi youngster adopting to the streets of America. This album brought forth not only a voice for young Desis who were constantly balancing between Desi culture and American culture, but a new genre of music: Desi Rap.

* The second was a female-fronted Chicago punk band that had a local hit in 1980 with the ""Automatic Mind"" / ""Unconventional Boy"" single. It had a handful of later releases, including a sole LP, 1981's Deviations.

* The third was a Czech jazz rock / progressive rock band from the 70's:
 
In its time, Bohemia was to Czechoslovakia what UK was to the international prog scene - a supergroup formed by the cream of the crop Czech prog and fusion musicians. These included keyboardist Lesek Semelka (ex-Blue Effect), saxophonist Jan Kubik (ex-Flamengo), bassist Vladimir Kulhanek (ex-Flamengo) drummer Pavel Trnavsky (Jazz Q) and the 20 year old guitar prodigy Michal Pavlicek (ex-Expanze, later Prazsky Vyber & Stromboli). They grouped together in 1975. The leading figures in the band and the two main writers were Semelka and Kubik. There was something of a personality clash between them, as Semelka wanted the band to go in a pop direction (they also sometimes played as a backup band for pop acts), while Kubik had a more prog-oriented vision. Perhaps this is the reason for their ephemeral existence, yet in their measly three years they released a classic of Czech prog rock: Zrnko pisku. By this time the line-up was also expanded by keyboardists Michael Kocab and Jan Hala, and Jiri Tomek on percussion. This early association of Kocab and Pavlicek shows the roots of the 80's new wave legend, Prazsky Vyber. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bohemia"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
