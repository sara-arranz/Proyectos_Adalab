Known for his variegated vocals, Malone has gained acclaim for blending genres and subgenres of hip-hop, pop, R&B, and trap. His stage name was derived from inputting his birth name into a rap name generator

Malone began his music career in 2011 and gained recognition with his 2015 debut single ""White Iverson"", which peaked at number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100.

Austin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York. He was raised by his father, Richard Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip-hop, country, and rock. When Malone was nine years old, he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys. Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game Guitar Hero.

Malone has always had a love for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event. According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band. He says soon afterward he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip-hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.

According to Malone, he chose ""Post Malone"" as his stage name when he was 14 or 15. The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone, but Malone later explained that ""Post"" is his last name, and he used a ""rap name generator"" to get ""Malone"". At 16, using the audio editor Audacity, Malone created his first mixtape, Young and After Them Riches. He showed it to some of his classmates at Grapevine High School. He was voted ""Most Likely to Become Famous"" by his classmates as a senior in high school. He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.

Malone later enrolled in Tarrant County College but dropped out. After leaving college, Malone moved to Los Angeles, California, with his longtime friend Jason Probst, a professional game streamer.

In August 2016, Malone issued an apology for his album, Stoney, being late. It was available for pre-order on November 4 and was finally released on December 9.

7,natti natasha,306506,4359458,"Natalia Alexandra Gutiérrez, known by her stage name Natti Natasha, is a Dominican reggaeton singer, songwriter, and actress. Hailing from Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Natasha grew up surrounded by endless musical influences and enrolled in Santiago’s School of Fine Arts at the age of seven where she developed her singing abilities, describing her time at the school as “one of the best of her life.” Her studio experience would begin as a teenager when she would record songs as a hobby and later alongside friends.

This all led up to her decision to make the biggest and riskiest move of her life, and that was to move to the United States. She settled in the Bronx, New York, or “the City of the Dreams and Dreamers” for young, aspiring musicians like her at the time. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Natti called the move “one of the craziest moves anyone ever did in her family,” and that she often looks back at the decision and wonders what she was doing. Natti would hop from studio to studio, working without pay, but to her, this was a way to get her name out there. A producer friend from Santiago would soon step in and lend her his New York studio.

Natti’s first-ever break came when icon Don Omar signed her to his record label, the Orfanato Music Group, and the pair would go on to make history for years to come. Their collaborations “Dutty Love,” “Tus Movimientos,” “Perdido en tus Ojos,” and a “Hold Ya” remix with Gyptian made waves across Latin America and introduced the world to future reggaeton royalty. Her debut project, an EP titled “All About Me” was released on March 28, 2012.

Natti would continue to make big career moves throughout the years including her departure from Don Omar’s record label and signing onto Pina Records in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2017 when her big breakout would come once and for all. Not only did she record and release a collaboration titled “Otra Cosa” alongside the legendary Daddy Yankee, but she also released what was arguably the biggest song of 2017. “Criminal” featuring Ozuna became an instant hit upon its release, the music video amassing over 1 billion views in just five months and becoming the most watched music video by a female singer released that year.

2019 saw the release of her much-anticipated debut album, “ilumiNATTI,” on February 15. 15 tracks made up the project with two collaborations in total, “Te Lo Dije'' with Anitta and “Soy Mía” with Kany García. Standout track “La Mejor Version de Mi” would transform into a bachata hit with its remix featuring bachata king Romeo Santos.

Natti’s sophomore album titled “NATTIVIDAD” would be released two years later on September 24, 2021 with 17 tracks featuring several chart-topping collaborators such as Becky G, Maluma, and Prince Royce. The release was followed up by the six-episode docuseries titled “Everybody Loves Natti” which documented her pregnancy and relationship with fiancé Raphy Pina. The series premiered on November 19, 2021 on Amazon Prime Video and was generally well received. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Natti+Natasha"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1) Christopher Maurice Brown (born May 5, 1989) from Tappahannock, Virginia.

""Nobody needs to write a bio for me. This is stupid. My name is SAINt JHN, that's my real name, it's spelled a little different tho. I'm from Brooklyn, I spent half of my childhood growing up in Georgetown, Guyana. I was dirt poor in Brooklyn and some version of rich in Guyana, because apparently 2 nickles can buy you a sports car in a 3rd world country. Who knew?! I'm from a SUPER Christian household where my mom forced us to go to every church imaginable, EVERY, SINGLE, WEEK! I hated it. I still won't go to church to this day. I'm a product of a father that was a hustler, preacher for a mother and a rapper for an older brother. Jay z and Beenie Man were my musical hero's growing up. I don't know how to describe the music I make, don't know what genre it belongs to and I don't exactly care. I make what I want to hear and paint the pictures that I want to see in the world. I got my start writing songs for other people, I got lucky I don't know how that happened but I did. I wrote some records for Usher, Kiesza, Gorgon City and a few other people. I was having success, but then I quit, cause who wants to live their dreams through someone else's eyes. So I put out my first project, Collection One. And here we are now, I hope you like whatever comes next cause I have no fvcking idea!""

A collision of feelings, ideas, and misty ambiance, SAINt JHN's music is a living mosaic. Pulling from his dual upbringing in Guyana and Brooklyn, he swirls themes of love, joy and sorrow with emotive R&B, Hip-Hop and Afrofusion into an inimitable kaleidoscope of sounds and sensations. You could call it genre-fluid but it's easier to say it's SAINt JHN, a singer-songwriter and model who has earned two Grammy Awards and a global fan base while becoming one of the most distinct voices in the world of music.

Cazzu es una artista de música urbana que se caracteriza por haber sido siempre muy voluble. Ha trabajado muchos estilos durante toda su carrera, pero encontró en el trap y el reguetón su verdadero lenguaje. El trap es por definición un compendio de géneros aglutinados, y Cazzu conoce perfectamente todos y cada uno de ellos.


La trapera estudió cine, y su conocimiento de la estética visual le ha ayudado mucho a la hora de conformar la suya propia. Su estilo es desinhibición en estado puro. Cargada de energía, para dar caña con cada tema.

Cazzu, con temas suaves que invitan a bailar y a moverse, es conocedora de todos esos géneros tan interesantes que conforman el trap argentino. Por ello, la trapera es sin duda una de las reinas del trap latino e internacional.

Se presentó en el panorama con su primer tema Killa. Una canción que sienta unas bases muy claras, una carta de presentación como mujer empoderada, llena de espíritu underground. La artista se ha ganado el respeto de todos los artistas de trap del panorama latino, llegando a colaborar con muchos de ellos.

Sus colaboracion con Bad Bunny, Duki y Khea en LOCA y LOCA REMIX es un himno del trap mundial.

Black Eyed Peas went to centenary state high school and got their start in 1988 when will.i.am (born 1975 William James Adams Jr.) and apl.de.ap (born 1974 Allan Pineda) began rapping and performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to Ruthless Records (run by Eazy-E) after catching the attention of the nephew of Jerry Heller (Eazy-E's manager). Along with Mookie Mook (Burning Star), Dante Santiago & DJ Motiv8, they called their group A.T.B.A.N. Klann. Their debut album, 'Grass Roots', was not released originally because Ruthless did not consider the social themes reflected in the group's music to be marketable to their audience. A single ""Puddles of H2O"" was released in 1994 but no album was released (until it leaked onto the Internet in the mid 2000s). 

After Eazy-E died of an AIDS related illness in 1995, they changed their name to Black Eyed Peas; will.i.am explained on the front cover of the Monkey Business album that ""Black Eyed Peas are food for the soul"", hence the name. will.i.am has cited the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an influence and said he named his band after a food, like them. They replaced their original third member Mookie, with Dante Santiago the Peas original singer. Then Taboo (born Jaime Gomez) joined the group. Dante Santiago took on a role as a guest vocalist in the band and featured frequently on various tracks for their first four albums. 

In 1996, they produced and appeared on a song entitled ""That's Right"" for Brian Austin Green's hip-hop album One Stop Carnival. Later, they began using Kim Hill as a steady background singer. Unlike many hip-hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a musical and clothing style that differed wildly from the ""gangsta rap"" sounds of other Los Angeles-based hip-hop acts at the time. Through the mid-'90s, they performed in the local club circuit alongside fellow acts such as Ozomatli and Jurassic 5.

The group were signed to Interscope Records and released their debut, ""Behind the Front"", in 1998. The album won the group (and their accompanying live band, the Bucky Jonsons) critical acclaim. The album featured the single ""Joints & Jams"", which was included on the Bulworth soundtrack. Their second album, ""Bridging the Gap"", was released in 2000; it featured the single ""Request + Line"" featuring Macy Gray.

After replacing their female background singer with Fergie, the group released their breakout album, ""Elephunk"", and their 2005 album, ""Monkey Business"", which featured the hit singles ""Pump It"", ""Don't Phunk With My Heart"", ""Don't Lie"" and ""My Humps"".

""The E.N.D. (The Energy Never Dies)"", their fifth album, was released worldwide in June 2009 and has managed to sell 5 million copies in 8 months (Elephunk: 7 million, Monkey Business: 10 million). It already spawned 2 of the most downloaded singles of all time: ""Boom Boom Pow"" and ""I Gotta Feeling"", both were downloaded 5 million times only in the USA. The 3rd single ""Meet Me Halfway"" was downloaded 2 million times and the 4th ""Imma Be"", which was just released, already sold 1 million. ""Rock That Body"" is the 5th single.

In December 2014, Kirk made a quick decision to become a rapper, taking the name Baby Jesus and issuing his NonFiction mixtape a month later. Never having been on a stage before, he headed to South by Southwest in the spring of 2015. Kirk changed his name to DaBaby, going so far as to explain the ""political reasons"" for this decision in the lyrics to ""DaBaby (Intro),"" a short introduction to 2016's God's Work Resurrected, his first mixtape under the new moniker. This release featured a cameo from Boosie Badazz and began to attract the attention of fans and peers alike.

Multiple mixtapes followed in the coming months, with 2017 offering Billion Dollar Baby, Baby Talk, Baby Talk 2, 3, and 4, as well as Back on My Baby Jesus Sh!t. 2018 continued in a similarly fashion with Baby Talk 5 and Blank Blank. In November of 2018, while shopping with his family at a Walmart in Huntersville, North Carolina, Kirk was approached by several men. An altercation broke out and gunfire ensued, resulting in the death of 19-year-old Jalyn Domonique Craig. Kirk, while involved in the dispute, did not admit to firing the fatal shots and was not charged with any crime connected to the incident. DaBaby got a label deal in 2019 when he signed on with Interscope.

43,ynw melly,878595,28883352,"Jamell Maurice Demons (born May 1, 1999), better known by his stage name YNW Melly, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter who emerged from Gifford, Florida. YNW Melly is also co-founder of rap collective, YNW. His music often draws from his lived experiences, evidenced by his 2017 incarceration for weapons charges. Upon release, he began to gain popularity from his track “Murder On My Mind.” which he wrote while in jail. After the release of the track, he was once again arrested as the song violated his probation, and sent him back to prison.

Melly’s career initially started to take off in 2018 when singles such as “Virtual (Blue Balenciagas)”, “Butter Pecan”, and “772 Love” had begun to gain popularity alongside “Murder on My Mind.”

On August 3, 2018, Melly released his debut mixtape I AM YOU which included his popular single, “Murder on My Mind”. It also included a sequel to the song called “Mind on My Murder”.

After leaving the studio with companions YNW Bortlen, YNW SakChaser, and YNW Juvy, on the night of October 26, 2018, Melly and his friends had been caught in a drive-by-shooting where SakChaser and Juvy were murdered. Melly and Bortlen were the only survivors of the attack.

While working on his sophomore mixtape, after the death of his friends, Melly had gained more attention and began to obtain cosigns from several rappers such as Young Thug, Trippie Redd, and Kodak Black. However, on January 3, 2019, Melly was arrested for possession of marijuana.

On January 18, 2019, while incarcerated, Melly released his sophomore mixtape We All Shine, which included one of his most influential cosign’s, Kanye West who was a feature on the song “Mixed Personalities.”.

Melly was released from jail on January 25, 2019, and released “Gang”, the first day out single that had taken off after the hype around “Mixed Personalities.”

After being released for only a month, on February 13, 2019, Melly turned himself in after a warrant was put out for him and Bortlen connecting to the murders of YNW Sakchaser and YNW Juvy. YNW Melly posted this to his Instagram on February 13:

To all my fans and supporters no I did not get locked up in Washington , but I am turning myself in today I want you guys to know I love you and appreciate every single one of y'all, a couple months ago I lost my two brothers by violence and now the system want to find justice.. unfortunately a lot of rumors and lies are being said but no worries god is with me and my brother @ynw.bortlen and we want y'all to remember it’s a ynw Family I love you @ynwsakchaser1 and @ynwjuvy #freeus

Prior to his incarceration, songs such as “Murder on My Mind” and “Mind on My Murder” had gained traction making their way in the Billboard Hot 100 and gaining RIAA certifications in a matter of months. Speculations made people believe that the songs were related to the murders, however, they were soon put to rest due to the time of the recordings being almost two years prior to the shootings.

After spending months incarcerated, on November 22, 2019, he released his debut studio album, Melly vs. Melvin featuring his 9lokkNine-assisted “223’s”.

After the rise of COVID-19 disease in 2020, on April 3, Melly had tested positive for the virus while awaiting trial. After being infected, Melly’s lawyers tried to play this to his advantage and requested a medical release as conditions can worsen in the jail environment. Melly was denied release on April 17 and conditions have been said to worsen since.

After the release of fellow Floridian rapper Kodak Black, Melly’s team had taken advantage and released “Thugged Out” to keep Melly’s name alive in the industry. They carried on releasing singles throughout the year with artists such as Queen Naija and Hotboii.

Again, while still awaiting trial, on August 13, 2021, he released his sophomore studio album, Just A Matter of Slime, featuring his highly anticipated Lil Uzi Vert-assisted “Mind of Melvin”.

After prosecutors had claimed they had a confession of Melly admitting to the murders, on November 1, Melly’s lawyers came out and denied the claims and said that Melly was just rapping a song titled “4:30 AM” by Kevin Gates. Soon after, on November 30, Melly’s trial had been set for March 7, 2022. - TippleTripple123 <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/YNW+Melly"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

57,drake,5936355,835016675,"Aubrey ""Drake"" Graham (born October 24, 1986) is an Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and businessman. Drake was an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s. Intent on pursuing a career in music, he left the series in 2007 after releasing his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.

Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum. His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same, were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late and collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of which earned platinum certification in the U.S. His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records. The dancehall-influenced album sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over 10 years. The album's second single, ""One Dance"", topped the charts in several countries, and became his first number-one single as a lead artist. That year, Drake led both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts simultaneously for eight weeks.

Views achieved quadruple platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. It became Drake's best-selling album to date. Its lead single ""Hotline Bling"" peaked at number two on the Hot 100 and received Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song, as well as ""One Dance"" which was proclaimed the song of the summer in 2016. In 2017, he released the ""playlist"" More Life. It became his seventh consecutive number one on the Billboard 200, and set multiple streaming records. A year later, he released the double album Scorpion, which also broke several streaming records, and contains the Grammy Award winning number-one single ""God's Plan"", and the bounce-infused number one singles ""Nice for What"" and ""In My Feelings"".

Among the world's best-selling music artists, with over 170 million records sold worldwide, he is ranked by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) as the world's highest-certified digital singles artist. Drake holds several Billboard chart records. He has the most charted songs (205) among solo artists in the history of the Billboard Hot 100, the most simultaneously charted Hot 100 songs in a single week (27), the most time on the Hot 100 (431 weeks) and the most Hot 100 debuts in a week (22). He also has the most number one singles on the Hot Rap Songs, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay and Rhythmic Charts. Drake has also won four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, twenty-seven Billboard Music Awards and three Juno Awards. As an entrepreneur, Drake has founded the OVO Sound record label with longtime collaborator 40 in 2012.

Early life
Drake attended both Forest Hill Collegiate Institute (left) and Vaughan Road Academy (right) during high school.
Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practicing Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Drake's mother, Sandra ""Sandi"" Graham (née Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. His parents met after Dennis performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he first interacted with Sandra, who was in attendance. He is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day school, and formally celebrated becoming a Bar Mitzvah in a religious service.

Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Dennis' limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the United States until Drake's early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, however, Dennis would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer. His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song titled ""Drake's Dad"". Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell records, which Drake vehemently denies.

Drake was raised in two Toronto neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end until grade six, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighborhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move, Drake replied, ""[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement; my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.""

He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school. He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighborhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighborhood, Drake described the school as ""not by any means the easiest school to go to."" Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background, and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school. He later graduated in October 2012.

Career - 2001–2005: Degrassi: The Next Generation
At 15, eager to begin as an actor, a high school friend introduced Drake to his father, who was an acting agent. The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks a basketball star who became physically disabled after a classmate shot him. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, ""My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV"". He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, returning for sporadic appearances until his character graduated from school. Overall, Drake appeared in a total of 145 episodes.

2006–2009: Early mixtapes and So Far Gone
Lil Wayne, the founder of Young Money Entertainment, would sign Drake to the label in 2009.
After becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as ""pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it."" The mixtape was released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies. In 2007, he released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single ""Replacement Girl"", featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever-unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with ""Replacement Girl"" being featured on the channel's ""New Joint of the Day"" segment on April 30, 2007. The song also saw Drake sample ""Man of the Year"" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including ""Ransom"", ""Forever"", and a remix to ""Brand New"". Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.

In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles ""Best I Ever Had"" and ""Successful"", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs ""I'm Goin' In"" and ""Fear"". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.

Due to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as ""one of the biggest bidding wars ever"". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album titled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means.

Drake then joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of ""Best I Ever Had"" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He underwent surgery later that year.

2010–2012: Thank Me Later and Take Care
Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.

On March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single ""Over"", which peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, ""Find Your Love"", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[76] The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, ""]Care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image]."" The third single and fourth singles, ""Miss Me"" and ""Fancy"" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.

Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.

It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire on May 8, and he had also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.

Beginning his second effort in fall 2010, Drake announced his intentions to allow for Noah ""40"" Shebib to handle most of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me Later, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and others. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be Take Care. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, ""I didn't get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed many of the songs and sonically I didn't get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round."" Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.

In January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie, to focus on the album. ""Dreams Money Can Buy"" and ""Marvins Room"" were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track listing, while ""Marvins Room"" gained Gold certification by the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio. Drake would soon release the song's music video on June 28.

""Headlines"" was released on August 9, acting as the lead single for Take Care. It was met with positive critical and commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12. It was eventually certified Platinum in both the United States and Canada. The music video for the single was released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game in January 2012. ""Make Me Proud"" was released as the album's second single, on October 16. It was the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number nine the following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88. ""Make Me Proud"" soon became Drake's fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.

Prior to the album's release, Drake had planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne, however, it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne. He had also begun collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled Y.O.L.O., but the duo decided against the project, in favor of increased concern for their respective studio albums.

Take Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. John McDonnell of NME dubbed it ""an affecting masterpiece"" and commended its ""delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive lyrics."" Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal found Drake's ""technical abilities"" to be improved and stated, ""Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up."" Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice called it ""a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West."" Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented the depth of Drake's ""moral psychodramas"" and stated, ""the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying power."" It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial success, eventually being certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the US.

The album's third and fourth singles, ""The Motto"" and Take Care"", were released on November 29, and February 21, 2012 respectively. Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with ""The Motto"" credited for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States. The music video for ""Take Care"" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, ""None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] - make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it."" The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year. The song was also featured on the channel's ""Pop Songs You Must Hear"" list of 2011. ""HYFR"" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified Gold. It would later win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video in 2012, and the channel also ranked him at number two on their ""Hottest MCs in the Game"" list.

In promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip-hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million. He then returned to acting, starring in Ice Age: Continental Drift as Ethan.

2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and commercial mixtapes
During the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer's influence over his next album. Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics prevalent previously.

In January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off of his third album at the conclusion of the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of his third album. The album's second single, ""Hold On, We're Going Home"", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful single off of the album, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song's music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the video. Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing the album's third single, ""Too Much"", alongside featured artist Sampha.

Nothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favorable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in 808s & Heartbreak. The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further promoted by the ""Would You like a Tour?"" throughout late 2013, to early 2014. It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million. Drake then returned to acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night Live, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what ""kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters"". Drake also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city. In late 2014, Drake announced that he had begun recording sessions for his fourth studio album.

In 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the Romeo Santos song Odio. He also appeared on a remix of Tuesday by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard's Rhythmic chart and number twelve on the ""Hot 100"", and released ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"" as a non-album single. The latter went double platinum in the United States.

On February 12, 2015, Drake released If You're Reading This It's Too Late onto iTunes, with no prior announcement. Despite debate on whether it is an album or a mixtape, its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money Records, a scheme that was rumored to allow Drake to leave the label. However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and If You're Reading This It's Too Late sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall. Drake proceeded If You're Reading This It's Too Late with a collaborative mixtape with Future, which was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week.

What a Time to Be Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Drake the first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the same year since 2004. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units. Drake also appeared on the cover of The Fader for their 100th issue.

2016–2017: Views and More Life
Drake announced in January 2016 that his fourth studio album would be launched during the spring, releasing the promotional single ""Summer Sixteen"" later that month. The album was originally titled Views from the six, but would later be shortened to Views. ""Summer Sixteen"" debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip-hop to more tenured artists. This move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as ""goodly brash"" or ""conventionally disrespectful."" It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake popularizing the term ""The Six"" when referencing Toronto. Drake also crashed a Bat Mitzvah in New York City on February 20, performing at the event.

Drake soon released the album's lead singles, ""Pop Style"" and the dancehall-infused ""One Dance"", on April 5. Both debuted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with ""One Dance"" becoming Drake's first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist. The single also became Drake's first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed the album's release date of April 29, and followed it up with various promotional videos. On October 15, ""One Dance"" became Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016.

Views was previewed in London, before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being made available to various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later to release a short film titled Please Forgive Me, starring frequent collaborators, Swedish twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta. As of 2019, Views remains Drake's best-selling album.

Drake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as the show's musical guest. Later, Drake was named as a member of the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury. During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the music video for ""Child's Play"" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics. On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views. At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Drake received the most nominations, with 10, winning the awards for Album of the Year and Best Hip-Hop Video. Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the course of the tour in Europe. Seven additional dates were added a day later due to overwhelming demands.

Soon after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed he would be releasing a project titled More Life in December, however he later pushed the date back to the new year. The project was described as a ""playlist of original music"", rather than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album. He was later revealed to be Spotify's most streamed artist for the second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion streams for all projects on the service, which is more than double the amount of streams he had in 2015. Drake later secured his second and third Grammy Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony. Despite multiple setbacks, Drake announced More Life would be released on March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials released through Instagram. Upon release, More Life received mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200, earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It also set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever streamed album in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music alone. The album also garnered 61.3 million streams on Spotify, dethroning Ed Sheeran's ÷ as the highest opening on the service in a single day. He later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins in a single show. Billboard also reported Drake had been present on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has the most recorded entries by a solo artist.

He then released the single ""Signs"" on June 24, as well as reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset. The singles marked his first releases since More Life, with ""Signs"" was initially released as a collaboration between Drake and French fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the ""Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2018"" fashion show. The event also had a playlist exclusively from OVO Sound, curated by label co-founder Oliver El-Khatib. Drake later hosted the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of Virginia Black. Drake then appeared in The Carter Effect documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince Carter, who was the first superstar player to appear for the Toronto Raptors since the franchise's inception in 1995. The documentary also featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and LeBron James.

2018: Scorpion and return to television
After rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer Pi'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017. Two songs would later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on January 20, 2018, marking Drake's first solo release since More Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring on a remix of the Jay-Z song ""Family Feud"" with Lil Wayne, as the lead single of the latter's Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape. Scary Hours featured the songs ""Diplomatic Immunity"" and ""God's Plan"", which both debuted within the top-ten, with the latter eventually breaking various streaming records as it debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was Drake's second as a solo artist to reach number one.

Drake earned his 70th top 40 hit after featuring on the Migos song ""Walk It Talk It"", which debuted at number eighteen, and peaked at number ten. He later featured on BlocBoy JB's debut single, ""Look Alive"", which was released on February 9, 2018. The song's entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper with the top 10 hits on the Hot 100, with 23. He then featured on a remix to ""Lemon"", a song originally released as collaboration between band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, Drake announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was releasing a single later that night. On April 6, ""Nice for What"" was released, alongside a music video, which featured several female celebrities.

After ""Nice For What"" replaced his own ""God's Plan"" on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace their former number-one debut, Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion, with a planned release date of June 29, 2018. He then released ""I'm Upset"" on May 26, as the album's third single. Scorpion was then released as a double-album, and marked Drake's longest project, with a run-time of just under 90 minutes. The album broke both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it gained 132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming service, respectively. It eventually sold 749,000 album equivalent units in its first week of sales, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.

Shortly thereafter, Drake collaborated with British hip hop promotion Link Up TV on July 7, releasing a freestyle as a part of the promotion's 'Behind Barz' segment, before releasing another freestyle a week later after featuring on Charlie Sloth's long-running Fire in the Booth program on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Drake then earned his sixth number-one hit with ""In My Feelings"" on July 21, which also spawned the viral ""#InMyFeelingsChallenge"" or ""#KiKiChallenge"". The success of ""In My Feelings"" also made Drake the record holder for most number one hits among rappers. Soon after, he released the music video for ""Nonstop"", which was filmed in London during his surprise performance at the Wireless Festival.

He then appeared on the album Astroworld, featuring uncredited vocals for the song ""Sicko Mode"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Drake announced in July 2018 that he planned to ""take 6 months to a year"" to himself in order to produce television and films, including Euphoria. He then began the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour with co-headliners Migos on August 12. This preceded collaboration with Bad Bunny titled ""Mia"", which featured Drake performing in Spanish. He later received the award for Hot Ticket Performer at the 2018 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 16. During a performance in Edmonton on November 7, Drake announced his intention to begin composing his next project in early 2019.

2019–present: Upcoming album
In February 2019, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rap Song, for ""God's Plan"", at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. During his speech, producers abruptly cut to a commercial break, leading viewers to speculate they were censoring his speech during which he criticized The Recording Academy. A legal representative for the Academy then released a statement stating ""a natural pause [led] the producers [to] assume that he was done and cut to commercial,"" and added the organization offered him an opportunity to return to stage, but he declined.

On February 14, Drake re-released his third mixtape, So Far Gone, onto streaming services for the first time to commemorate its 10-year anniversary, and later collaborated with Summer Walker on a remix of Walker's song ""Girls Need Love"", marking his first release of 2019. On April 10, 2019 during a London performance on his Assassination Vacation Tour, the OVO leader told the crowd he was working on his new album before the show. On June 8, Drake appeared on Chris Brown's single ""No Guidance"". On June 15, Drake released two songs, ""Omertà"" and ""Money in the Grave"", on his EP The Best in the World Pack to celebrate the NBA Championship win of the Toronto Raptors. On August 2, he released the compilation album Care Package, consisting of songs released between 2010 and 2016 that were initially unavailable for purchase or commercial streaming; it debuted at number one.

Artistry - influences
Drake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West, Jay Z, and Lil Wayne, while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah, and Usher. Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his ""biggest inspirations"".

Musical style
Drake has credited Kanye West (left) and Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical influences. Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism. His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as ""ting"", ""touching road"", ""talkin' boasy"" and ""gwanin' wassy"". Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip-hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing. He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.

The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional or boastful. However, Drake is often revered for incorporating ""degrading"" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between ""pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata."" Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as ""hyper-reality rap"", which is characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as being distinct from the ""real world.""

Public image
The Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States, with his single, ""The Motto"", which includes, ""You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO."" Drake later popularized the term ""The Six"" in 2015 in relation his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city. Furthermore, the subject matter of his artistry often revolving around relationships, have had widespread impact on social media through photo captions commonly used to reference emotions or personal situations. However, his lyrical contents have had a negative reception from fans and critics deeming him as sensitive; a trait that is understood as being antithetical to hip hop culture. June 10 was declared ""Drake Day"" in Houston, Texas. In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines, in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance. In 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States. He would also donate $200,000 in order to aid relief efforts in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey. In February 2018, following the single ""God's Plan"" debut at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Drake donated $50,000 to a Miami homeless shelter and giving a University of Miami student $50,000 to help with her tuition. Drake then ""kept up the spending spree"" by donating the rest of the song's video budget, $996,631.90, to several charitable causes and regular people across Miami.

The music video for ""Hotline Bling"" went viral, due to Drake's eccentric choices in dancing. The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake's unconventional nature on the song, causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, spawning several parodies. Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exampled by the video for ""Hotline Bling"". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6"" Classic Boots. This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose, in which various items of clothing were produced. Drake had also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the ""Air Jordan OVOs"". Moreover, his style and dress sense have caused GQ magazine to describe him as ""[one of] the most stylish men alive"".

Controversies - legal issues
In 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on ""Marvins Room"". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties. Despite Drake's legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling ""Jimmy Smith Rap"", a 1982 single by jazz musician, Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who stated Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on ""Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2"", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop. Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement. Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics on when collaborating with YG on the song ""Who Do You Love?"". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year. In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.

In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel ""Chubbs"" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also says the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering. The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu, after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference; the judge ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense.

Feuds
Drake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident and released a song criticizing Drake weeks later. Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute.

In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe magazine. Drake would later respond on ""6 God"" and ""6PM in New York"", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment.

Further controversy arose in July 2015, when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during recording sessions for ""RICO"", one of the lead singles off of Mill's second studio album. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller. Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for ""R.I.C.O."". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for ""R.I.C.O."", ""10 Bands"", and ""Know Yourself"". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, titled ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back"", in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with ""Wanna Know"", before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later. Despite subliminal disses from either artist, the feud has not been officially reignited. Drake would further seek to denounce Funkmaster Flex during his Madison Square Garden shows on the Summer Sixteen Tour. Following Meek Mill's sentencing of two to four years for probation violation, Drake stated ""Free Meek Mill"" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on ""Family Feud"". Pusha T would also use the same rationale to criticize Drake on ""Infrared"" in 2018, prompting Drake to respond with the ""Duppy Freestyle"" diss track on May 25. Pusha T would directly respond to the track through ""The Story of Adidon"" on May 29, which presented several claims, including an accusation of Drake fathering a secret child. The pair is considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, with Drake yet to respond to ""The Story of Adidon"".

In 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through ""4PM in Calabasas"", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on ""No Shopping"" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song. However, French Montana claimed that Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake, he has yet to officially respond to Budden. In the same year, Drake mocked Kid Cudi for his mental health, drug use and suicidal urges on ""Two Birds, One Stone"" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter. Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.

In mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator, Kanye West. In an appearance on the talk show The Shop in October, Drake recounted several business meetings with West, who voiced his desire to ""be Quincy Jones"" and work with him, in order to replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson. West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, which was agreed to as Drake ""felt a genuine vibe"" from West, and after West gifted him the beat to ""Lift Yourself"", which inspired Drake to begin writing to the instrumental. West then requested Drake to travel to Wyoming to continue working, and arrived a day after close friend 40. 40 said West was working on an album; contradictory to his previous aim of just wanting to ""give [Drake] beats"". Drake responded by saying West stated he would release in late 2018, and they should continue on. However, upon his arrival in Wyoming, Drake ""[spent] the majority of time working on [West's] music"", only exploring his own after playing the producer the song ""March 14"", which addresses Drake's relationship with his newborn son and co-parent. This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T. West would also release ""Lift Yourself"", and produce ""Infrared""; actions that greatly displeased Drake. This prompted him to denounce West in several songs and live performances. West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018.

Drake has purported to have been in reported feuds with DMX, Kendrick Lamar, Common, The Weeknd, XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez, and Ludacris, although the latter three have been reported to be resolved.

Business ventures - Endorsements
Prior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient. In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger King and Whataburger. Business magazine Forbes commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships ""combined heavily"" for Drake's reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the highest-paid celebrities during that period.

Main article: OVO Sound
During the composition of Nothing Was the Same, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, and business partner, Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the trio to team up to form OVO Sound. The name is an abbreviation derived from the October's Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects. Warner Bros. Records currently distribute the label.

Drake, 40 and PartyNextDoor were the label's inaugural artists. The label houses artists including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, OB O'Brien, Roy Woods, dvsn, Plaza, and Kash Doll, as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Mike Zombie, Nineteen85, and Future the Prince. OVO Sound has released six albums, with two certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Toronto Raptors
On September 30, 2013, at a press conference with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke, Drake was announced as the new ""global ambassador"" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. This would also be the setting where Drake was given The Key to the City. In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities, beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary. He began by hosting an annual ""Drake Night"" segment with the organization, which began in 2013.

Apple Music
Following the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million. This saw all future solo releases by Drake becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers. Drake had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted More Life. Drake's partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform's sharp success, as it attained 10 million subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists, such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services. Through signing with the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before the smartwatch saw public release.

Virginia Black
Two months prior to the release of Views, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based whiskey. This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring's Restaurant in Toronto. The beverage was created and also distributed alongside Proximo Spirits, as well as with Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008. The company described the partnership as ""fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey.""

The product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically. The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music and various tours, such as being part of the ""Virginia Black VIP Lounge"" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016. The company later aired commercials with Dennis Graham, which featured the tagline of ""The Realest Dude Ever"" (in reference toward ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to various European countries in 2017.

Personal life
Drake lives in Hidden Hills, California, since 2012. He also owns a property in Toronto, which was built from the ground-up in 2017, and a Toronto condo adjacent to the CN Tower. He owns a Boeing 767 airplane.

Drake's paternal uncles are bass guitarist Larry Graham and musician Teenie Hodges. Graham achieved both critical and commercial success as a member of the band Sly and the Family Stone, while Hodges featured as the lead guitarist and songwriter for Al Green, and contributed heavily on much of his work in the 1970s, including the hits ""Take Me to the River"", ""Love and Happiness"", and ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"".

Drake is a father to one son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French artist Sophie Brussaux. Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumors after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017; Drake eventually confirmed his fatherhood on the album Scorpion in 2018.

Drake dated singer Rihanna off-and-on from 2009 to 2016. He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums, and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said ""she's a woman I've been in love with since I was 22 years old."" On becoming a single parent, he mused on the talk show The Shop:

As life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don't have the fairy tale, like, 'Oh, Drake started a family with Rihanna and this is like so perfect.' It looks so good on paper. By the way, I wanted that too at one time.

Other artists
There are several other artists that have performed under the name Drake:
1) heavy metal act
2) Jason Drake
3) 60s garage rock
4) Polish sea folk band

58,nf,1067520,75146131,"NF is the stage name of rapper and composer Nate Feuerstein from Gladwin, Michigan. Feuerstein endured a hardship-filled childhood in which his parents divorced, his mother's boyfriend physically abused him, and his mother eventually killed herself. Music was his escape, and he began recording songs on a karaoke machine, with instrumentals on one microphone and his raps in the other. Placing second in a nationwide Fine Arts Festival rap competition in 2008, and first in Michigan the following year, he independently released a debut album, Moments, in 2010. The album attracted the attention of Xist Music, which signed him to a recording deal in 2012, by which time Feuerstein had taken on the stage name NF. The label announced the release of an EP that same year, but it never appeared, and NF and Xist parted ways. NF spent the next two years looking for a label and working with local producer Tommee Profitt in his studio; they came up with the song ""Wake Up,"" which convinced Capitol Christian Music Group to sign him. CMG released a six-song (including a Manny Marroquin remix of ""Wake Up"") self-titled EP late in the summer of 2014. His debut album, Mansion, was released in early 2015 and reached number 62 on the Billboard 200 while topping the Christian Albums chart. The aptly titled Therapy Session followed in 2016 and also topped the Christian Albums chart with its raw emotions and honest lyrics. The following Summer saw the release of the singles ""Outro"" and ""Green Lights"", in anticipation of the arrival of his third studio long player, Perception, which dropped later that October. NF achieved mainstream popularity in 2017 with Perception; the album charted at number one in the United States and was certified platinum, while its third single, ""Let You Down"", reached number twelve on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was a top-ten hit internationally. He achieved similar commercial success with his follow-up The Search (2019). Feuerstein's most recent album, Hope, released on April 7, 2023, had commercial success and peaked at number 2 on the US Billboard 200. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/NF"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

59,young thug,1515445,137563629,"Jeffery Lamar Williams, better known by his stage name Young Thug (acronym for Truly Humble Under God, also uses the name ""SEX!!"" and was briefly known as ""Jeffery""), is an American rapper from Atlanta, Georgia who is signed to Gucci Mane's 1017 Brick Squad Records, Asylum Records and Atlantic Records. Thug grew to prominence in 2013 after releasing his mixtape 1017 Thug to positive critical reception. He has collaborated with artists such as Gucci Mane, Young Scooter, Rich Homie Quan and Waka Flocka Flame.

Thug was born amongst the masses eliminating any doubt that he wouldn’t be special. The second youngest child of 11 children developed a skill for standing out amongst many, early. Young Thug moved to Jonesboro, an impoverished suburb of Georgia where his lifestyle was engrossed by the crime, drug addiction and violence that surrounded him. It was there that he developed an insatiable appetite to succeed his current situation. After discovering and acknowledging his talent and creativity for music in  2010, Thug started a new hustle that would soon mature as one of the most promising music careers in the South. He also founded the record label YSL ( Young Stoner/Slatt Life) in 2010.


Eyeballing the throne of Hip hop royalty, Young Thug began to create a sound and style that would inevitably place him on top. Young Thug’s catchy verses and raw lyrical talent distinguished noise from art, clearly being the latter his creations are the best that remain of Southern hip hop. He is the embodiment of the evolution of Southern hip-hop. Young Thug is the representative for a generation that doesn't see hip-hop as a hobby but a lifestyle. Keeping true to himself, his art, and his home Young Thug will stand alone as the one true savior of the Southern movement. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Young+Thug"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

60,cano,22335,485373,"CANO is a Franco-Ontarian folk-pop collective which was active from 1975 until 1985. While Wikipedia claims that CANO was ""progressive"", the band itself describes its style as a mix of folk, rock, and jazz (see www.canomusique.com).

The name comes from the Coopérative des artistes du Nouvel Ontario (CANO), an agricultural and artistic commune established in Sudbury, Ontario.

On stage, CANO was able to produce a level of intensity only comparable to a symphonic orchestra. They did not only produce the most European music in America in their era (which may have hurt their success chances in the U.S.), they did so while bridging the tremendous cultural gap between French and English Canada by including members from both parts and singing in both languages.

Members of the band are singer André Paiement (died in 1978), violinist Wasyl Kohut (died in 1981), guitarists Marcel Aymar and David Burt, bassist John Doerr, pianist Michel Kendel, and drummer Michel Dasti.

61,polo g,1021548,87704124,"Taurus Tremani Bartlett (born January 6, 1999), known professionally as Polo G, is an American rapper from Chicago, Illinois. He is best known for his song with Bronx rapper, Lil Tjay, ""Pop Out"", which has amassed over 80 million views on YouTube and peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Polo G was originally known for his Chicago drill sound, but eventually transitioned to a more melodic style. He has been noted for his ""vivid and explicit storytelling""; his lyrics often involve tough subjects, including racism and mental health. He also regularly pays homage to his hometown, and, as noted by Ayana Rashed of Respect, ""he is also quick to acknowledge the common injustice and frequent police brutality he and so many others face on the daily"". He has stated that American rapper Lil Wayne and hip-hop icon Tupac Shakur are his biggest influences. He also grew up listening to Gucci Mane, as well as Chicago rappers Lil Durk, G Herbo and Chief Keef.

Bartlett was born in the Old Town area of Chicago. He was raised by both of his parents and grew up with three siblings in a small project development known as Marshall Field Garden Apartments. Before his rise to fame, Bartlett spent multiple stints in prison. Bartlett's first song ever recorded was titled ""ODA"". Upon creating a SoundCloud account in 2018, he released the track ""Gang With Me"", which quickly racked up millions of plays. He continued gaining traction with his songs ""Welcome Back"" and ""Neva Cared"". Bartlett went on to release ""Finer Things"", a song he wrote while incarcerated, in the latter half of 2018 and quickly gained millions of views. In early 2019, Bartlett released ""Pop Out"" featuring Lil Tjay which peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song's music video gained over 200 million views on YouTube and led to him signing a record deal with Columbia Records. Bartlett also released videos for his songs ""Deep Wounds"", ""Through Da Storm"", ""Effortless"", and ""Dyin' Breed"" from his critically acclaimed debut studio album Die a Legend, which was released on June 7, 2019, and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard 200. ""Heartless"", a single released later in 2019, featured production from Mustard, and was later featured on his second album.

On February 14, 2020, Polo G released the track ""Go Stupid"", with rappers Stunna 4 Vegas and NLE Choppa. The song also featured production from Mike Will Made-It and Tay Keith. ""Go Stupid"" became his second song on the Hot 100 (after ""Pop Out""), peaking at number 60 on the Hot 100, number 29 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, and number 20 on Hot Rap Songs. Polo G released his second studio album, The Goat, on May 15, 2020. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and ten songs from the album hit the Hot 100, including ""Flex"" featuring Juice Wrld and ""Be Something"" featuring Lil Baby, peaking at numbers 30 and 57, respectively.

In July 2020, Polo G was featured on Juice Wrld's posthumous album Legends Never Die on the song ""Hate the Other Side"".

63,nle choppa,1172149,43803076,"Memphis teen rap sensation NLE Choppa has seen his circumstances change with the swiftness. He began freestyling with his friends at 14, started taking it seriously at age 15 and had millions of views and major-label interest shortly after his 16th birthday. He first got his buzz from ""No Chorus Pt. 3,"" a song and video from his crew Shotta Fam on which Choppa kicks off the song off and steals the show.
Since it's release in early January, NLE Choppa's ""Shotta Flow"" video has amassed more than 12 million views in nearly six weeks. The visual for his breakout record shows a precocious youth who is just as adept at dancing as he is at swinging choppas.

His flows and stylistic choices recall his friend and fellow hometown rapper BlocBoy JB. Yet Choppa is unique. His intensity, voice and dark sense of humor set him apart from the fray. His follow-up record, ""Shotta Flow 2,"" is approaching 2 million views in under a week.

Always business-savvy, Choppa turned down a $3 million dollar deal and opted for a partnership with UnitedMasters, a company that distributes his music while allowing him to keep his masters. With an EP coming in the spring and more videos on the way, the young artist's name is everywhere, even catching the attention of legendary rap mogul Birdman, who he's been spotted sharing studio time with. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/NLE+Choppa"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

71,will smith,1624940,15660730,"Willard Christopher Smith II (born September 25, 1968) is an American Oscar winning actor and a multiple Grammy winning hip hop artist. He is one of few people who have enjoyed legitimate success in the three major entertainment media in the United States: film, television, and the music industry.

Will Smith was born and raised in West Philadelphia. He spent most of his days in a playground, training basketball and relaxing all cool. Career-wise, he started as the vocalist of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, with his childhood friend Jeffrey ""DJ Jazzy Jeff"" Townes as turntablist and producer. The duo was known for performing humorous, radio-friendly songs, most notably ""Parents Just Don't Understand"" and ""Summertime."" They gained critical acclaim for winning the first ever Grammy in the Rap category (1988).

Smith was a charismatic and energetic performer but he was nearing bankruptcy when in 1990, the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him. The show was successful and helped revitalize his career

Although he made a notable dramatic film debut in Six Degrees of Separation (in which he played totally against type as a gay con man) while still appearing in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Smith's film career took off with his role in Bad Boys (1995) along with co-star Martin Lawrence.

After The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air ended in 1996, Smith began a successful solo music career while simultaneously starring in a series of films. The first two films were hugely successful summer blockbusters: Independence Day (1996), in which he played a fearless and confident fighter pilot, and Men in Black (1997), where he played the comic and confident Agent J against Tommy Lee Jones's deadpan Agent K. Smith's acting in Men in Black won critical praise. The two films established Smith's commercial reputation as a bankable star whose appeal across age, race, and gender lines could ""open"" a film at the box office. Because his movies usually open during the July 4th weekend, many people have come to call a July 4th weekend in which Will Smith stars in a movie ""Big Willie Weekend.""

Lead roles in Enemy of the State, Wild Wild West, Ali, Men in Black II Bad Boys II and ""I, Robot"" then followed. He also starred in 2005's Hitch. (Like Smith, Hitch co-star Kevin James starred in a sitcom named for royalty, The King of Queens.) His 2006 role is that of Chris Gardner in the ""inspired by a true story"", ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" was nominated for, ""Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role"" an Oscar in 2007. Smith's son Jaden also stars in the movie.(Jaden Smith as of 2010 lately played the lead role of Dre Parker in the 2010 remake of ""The Karate Kid"".) Will Smith's latest acting role was ""Seven Pounds"" in 2008 where he played Ben Thomas an IRS agent. Since then he's been producing movies that include, ""The Karate Kid""(2010), ""The Human Contract""(2009), and ""Lakeview Terrace""(2008)
 
Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the boxer Muhammad Ali in Ali.

Smith also released a string of hit singles, often associated with his most recent film, throughout the late 1990s. The most notable of these were his #1 hit theme song ""Men in Black,"" the #1 hit ""Gettin' Jiggy Wit It"" (which made jiggy a catchphrase for a while in 1998), and ""Just the Two of Us,"" an affecting message to his young son. His first two solo albums went platinum, but his third, on Columbia Records, was a sales disappointment compared to his past efforts, and after a quick Greatest Hits release that was almost not advertised at all, he was dropped by the label. He signed a recording contract with Interscope Records and released the successful Lost and Found in 2005. The album was propelled solely on the smash hit single, ""Switch,"" which appealed to the mainstream media ala ""Summertime."" The single stayed atop the charts for months and returned Smith to the forefront of Hip Hop.

Also, on February 6, 2005 he appeared in the Super Bowl XXX.

On July 2, 2005, Smith served as host for the Live 8 concert in his native Philadelphia before an enormous crowd, and later performed a set with DJ Jazzy Jeff.

Smith married actress Sharee Zampino in 1992. They had a son, Willard Christopher III, also known as ""Trey"", but divorced in 1995. Smith married actress Jada Pinkett in 1997. Together they have two children: Jaden Christopher Syre (born 1998) and Willow Camille Reign (born 2000). Along with his brother, Harry Smith, he owns Treyball Development Inc., a Beverly Hills-based company named after his first son. He has been consistently listed in Fortune Magazine's ""Richest 40"" list of the forty wealthiest Americans under the age of 40.

Will Smith has been criticized for his lip service to his home town of Philadelphia, PA. Several of his songs talk about parts of Philadelphia and the surrounding areas. While he has spoken over the years about how much he loves the city and how much he wants to give back, none of his proposed ventures in the city of Philadelphia have ever been developed. He has proposed opening a restaurant, several upscale bars, and a community center in Philadelphia which have never seen development. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Will+Smith"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

72,falling in reverse,1066786,48931919,"Falling in Reverse is an American rock band based in Las Vegas, Nevada and formed in 2008, signed to Epitaph Records. The band is led currently by vocalist Ronnie Radke alongside bassist Tyler Burgess, lead guitarist Max Georgiev and drummer Luke Holland. 

In 2008, lead singer Ronnie Radke was involved in an altercation in Las Vegas that resulted in the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Cook. While Radke did not shoot Cook, he was indicted on battery charges. These charges, combined with Radke's past troubles with narcotics and rehab, led to a suspended sentence and five years probation. After he failed to report to his probation officer he was arrested in June 2008, where his probation was revoked and he was mandated to serve his original sentence of two years in prison. At the time, Ronnie Radke was the lead singer of post-hardcore band Escape the Fate, which in 2006, released its debut album, Dying Is Your Latest Fashion. Following Radke's incarceration, he was ejected from the band and replaced by former Blessthefall lead singer Craig Mabbitt. Max Green, bassist of Escape the Fate, stated about Radke's law problems that, ""First we couldn't tour out of the country, then out of the state."" Radke was released on December 12, 2010.

During his time in prison, Radke formed a new band called From Behind These Walls. He officially began creating media with the band upon his release, but was later forced to change its name to Falling in Reverse due to copyright infringement. In 2009, with Radke still in prison, he was able to launch a demo of his band, due to contacts with several musicians he had. The demo contains four songs that were not put on the debut album The Drug in Me Is You. The original lineup consisted of Radke and bassist Nason Schoeffler, who helped find guitarist Jacky Vincent and rhythm guitarist Derek Jones. The band went through several drummers. Nick Rich was later replaced by Oscar Garcia, Khaled Biersack, and former LoveHateHero member Scott Gee, as official members, before finding former the Bigger Lights drummer Ryan Seaman. Schoeffler quit the band in April 2011 and was replaced by Mika Horiuchi, formerly of the band Cellador, who also later departed from the band after issues with Radke.

In January 2010, the band began recording for the first time. The group announced on December 20 that it would go to Orlando, Florida to record a full-length debut album over a period of two months with a tentative release date of the first quarter of 2011. The band also confirmed that Radke's friend, Michael Baskette, who has worked on Blessthefall's album Witness and Radke on Escape the Fate's debut Dying Is Your Latest Fashion, would produce the album. It was soon confirmed that the band was signed with Epitaph Records, Radke's former label with Escape the Fate, and the band released its debut album in 2011. The album was soon titled The Drug in Me Is You and was slated for a July 26, 2011 release date, with pre-orders beginning on June 7. The eleven song track list was released soon after. With the help of Executive Producer Michael ""Elvis"" Baskette, mixing and tracking for the album concluded on April 2, 2011. The album spawned the singles ""Raised by Wolves"" and ""The Drug in Me Is You"". The band's first music video was released for ""The Drug in Me Is You"" on June 28, 2011. The Drug in Me Is You was released in the United States on July 26, 2011 to mostly mixed reviews, but managed to sell 18,000 copies in its first week in the US charting at number 19 on the Billboard 200. A third single, ""I'm Not a Vampire"", was released a few months after the album's release on October 24 with an accompanying music video.

The songs for the debut album were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. Lead vocalist Ronnie Radke has often called the album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, ""I would think all day, for days and days, about what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in different ways. I don't know why these kids love the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it.""

In January 2012, former I Am Ghost bassist Ron Ficarro began filling in as Falling in Reverse's The Drug in Me Is You Tour touring bassist due to the departure of former bassist Mika Horiuchi. Later on Ronnie announced on stage that Ron Ficarro was replacing Mika permanently.

Vocalist Ronnie Radke had been hinting on Twitter that the group had been working on the band's second album, with tweets such as ""You guys don't understand how many light years my next album is from the last one"". He and bandmate Ron Ficarro tweeted pictures of them in the studio with Ryan Ogren working on some new music. Ronnie had said a little bit about the new album to Marshal Music News. He said that, ""The last record was so vengeful and bitter and spiteful - so everyone is wondering what I'm gonna sing about next. And I'm just not quite ready to let people know. I'm sorry. When people hear the new stuff though I promise you they will lose their mind. It's light years ahead of my last album. We're demoing new songs right now, as we speak, and I'm telling you, people are seriously gonna lose their mind."" During the band's performance at Dirt Fest 2012 in Birch Run Michigan, Radke announced to the crowd that it would be the group's last show before returning to the studio for the band's second album. Ronnie also said in an interview that the band would be in the studio late 2012 with demos already and hoping for an early 2013 release.

On May 7 the band released the first single and music video, ""Alone"", from the second album, titled, Fashionably Late. The cover, merchandise, and a June 18, 2013 release date was revealed on May 7 as well.

On May 21, the title track, ""Fashionably Late"" was released as the second single. Later, on May 30, the song, ""Born to Lead"" was streamed through YouTube. The entire album was uploaded to Epitaph Records' YouTube channel on June 12, allowing fans to listen to the album before the official release date.

On October 28, 2013, Falling in Reverse, along with Ronnie's former band Escape the Fate, announced that they would be touring together, with Falling in Reverse headlining, on the Bury The Hatchet Tour. The bands posted a video through Alternative Press with Ronnie and Escape the Fate singer Craig Mabbit being interviewed about the tour, stating that the tour came about due to the groups' acceptances of each other. During the tour, Ronnie made appearances on stage with Escape the Fate, singing the singles from Escape the Fate debut album Dying Is Your Latest Fashion (""Situations"" and ""Not Good Enough for Truth in Cliché"").

In March 2014, Radke announced that the band had begun recording its third album. On May 12, 2014, it was announced by Alternative Press that Falling in Reverse had parted ways with bassist Ron Ficarro, reporting that former Escape the Fate bassist Max Green (who announced his departure from Escape the Fate just 3 days before on May 9, six months after rejoining Escape the Fate) would be his replacement. Ronnie is quoted as saying ""Ron was probably the best bass player I've ever played with, but at this moment in time I feel it is best to part ways with him. I respect him and wish nothing but the best for him. Max quitting Escape The Fate was like a godsend. It was a no brainer to have him join. I've known him half my life and this will be a great new chapter to start. ""

In an interview with MTV, Radke stated that the next album would be nothing like the single Alone from Fashionably Late as it has no raps throughout the album; he stated that it is heavier and will contain more screams, moving his passion for rapping into his solo career. Radke explained in another interview that the third album will be more like a ""sequel"" to the Escape the Fate album Dying Is Your Latest Fashion and is aimed to be nostalgic to people who were fans of the band since then.

On December 15, 2014, the first single from the band's third album, Just Like You, titled ""God, If You Are Above..."" was released. On January 13, 2015, the group released its second single ""Guillotine IV (The Final Chapter)"" from the album. Just Like You was released on February 24. In February 2015, touring bassist Jonathan Wolfe was replaced by the official new member, and former Black Tide bassist, Zakk Sandler. ""Stay Away"", another single off of Just Like You, premiered on the BBC Radio1 Rock Show on February 15. The group premiered its new single, Sexy Drug, via Alternative Press the next day.

On February 17, 2015, a full album stream of Just Like You was released, a week before the scheduled release of the album. On February 24, 2015, Just Like You was released as planned, along with a music video for the song Just Like You.

On October 30, 2015, lead guitarist Jacky Vincent left the band on good terms before the band's fall tour with Attila, Metro Station and Assuming We Survive to focus on his solo career. On November 4, 2015, Christian Thompson confirmed himself as the new lead guitarist of the band. The video for the single Chemical Prisoner was released on January 27, 2016. The single performed moderately well on UK rock radio.

On January 6, 2016, the band members announced that they had begun work on their next album stating that it would be ""It's a huge left turn. It sounds like nothing we’ve ever done. Every song is very vibey, There's more feeling in it instead of a lot of metal."", further stating that ""We’re challenging ourselves now more than we ever have in the weirdest ways possible because you would think writing the craziest solo or riffs would be the challenging part. But the challenging part is trying to stick to a theme and not go all over the place like we would normally do."" On December 19, the band officially released the first single ""Coming Home"" from the untitled album. In January 2017, Radke began performing guitar for the band. On January 20, 2017, the band announced their next album Coming Home, which was released on April 7. Around the time of its release, it was rumoured that drummer Ryan Seaman parted ways with the band. This was confirmed when the band performed on May 8, without Seaman with Chris Kamrada playing drums as a touring member, who since left to play for Dashboard Confessional.

On February 23 2018, the band released a song called, Losing My Mind.

On April 16 2018, Christian officially announced via his Instagram page that his time with Falling In Reverse had come to an end. Though there was some controversy over the exact reason behind it, claims came from both sides that the departure was mutual but talk arose of irreconcilable differences and a decision was made to go separate ways. It has since been claimed that the split was due to differences between members causing an uneasy working environment.

On June 26, 2018, the band released a song called, Losing My Life along with a music video as a continuation of where the music video for Losing My Mind ended and featured a new line-up for the band which consists of Tyler Burgess on bass, Max Georgiev as lead guitarist, drummer Brandon ""Rage"" Richter, and Zakk Sandler on keyboards and rhythm guitar. The band also announced that they will be performing selected dates at the final year of the annual Vans Warped Tour with the new line up.

In April 2020, rhythm guitarist Derek Jones passed away. He was 35 years old. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Falling+in+Reverse"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

1) US indie pop 
2) Uruguay rap/trap 

1) James Cooley AKA Mesita is an American multi-instrumentalist from Colorado. He started releasing music under The Frustration Corporation, a plunderphonics project. He released his debut album under Mesita, Cherry Blossoms, in June 2008, with his debut EP No Worries coming out around a year later. In 2010, he released his second EP Living/Breathing. The EP changed his sound from indie rock to a more polished indietronica/pop sound. His second album Here's To Nowhere was released in March 2011, being supported by the single ""Somewhere Else/The New Age"". His third, The Coyote was released on April 3, 2012. In April 2013, he released XYXY, his 3rd EP. All of the songs from this EP were recycled onto his fourth album Future Proof, released on October 8, 2013. Mesita's album The Phoenix was released before New Year's Eve on December 30, 2014. It features the singles ""The Villain"" and ""Phoenix Deluxe"". In 2015, he released the single ""Be The Light"" which would be tagged onto his 4th EP Small Table as a bonus track in 2016, the title being a reference to the double meaning of his artist name. Only a few months after the February 2016 release of Small Table, he released ""With Love, From Laniakea"" which was supported by two singles, those being ""Montana"" & ""Blank Slate"".  His 5th EP ""Mall Music"" was released in 2017, supported by the singles ""Compliments"", ""Spiraling"", ""Intimacy"" & ""All Out in the Open"".
After his mother's passing, He would move away from Chicago, which he relocated to with the recording of Future Proof, to New York, and start work on Littleton, an album dedicated to her. The album would be his first to be made in a professional DAW, the DAW being used is Reason.  The song Sorting would be added onto Littleton shortly after release. Mesita would release his 6th EP ""Repackaged Trash"" in December 2018.
Sometime in 2019, he would become viral on X (Formerly Twitter) for doing short under 1-minute songs for people who asked. This led to the album ""You Are Beautiful"" in 2019, which consisted of longer versions of these styles of songs. This would eventually turn into a series in his discography, with ""You're Still Beautiful"", ""am i still beautiful"" and ""everyone is beautiful"".
After ""You Are Beautiful"", Mesita would release his 7th EP Blackwhite. All of the songs off of Blackwhite were released as singles before the release of the EP.
In 2019, Mesita would release their 7th Album Eat Ass or Die Trying. This album has been described by Mesita as his ""mental breakdown album"" Comparable to the ""Beautiful Series"", it features an almost spoken word type of singing/writing that feels like a conversation through song. In 2020, it would be reissued in a deluxe version with a second disc titled ""We Are All Going To Die""  His 9th album (counting We Are All Going to Die) ""Empty Island"" would release later in 2020. His 10th album and the spiritual successor to Eat Ass or Die Trying ""Life is Flashing Before My Eyes One Day At a Time"" would release in 2021.
After this album, Mesita's releases would become scarce, only dropping songs just to immediately delete them off of whatever platform it was uploaded to. Mesita has a history of wiping their discography from streaming and other services such as YouTube, leading to many songs/videos being lost, even to Mesita himself. His original YouTube account would be deleted at some point between 2019 - 2020, He now uploads under the Mesita Reuploads account. His 11th album is set to release in March 2024.

78,youngboy never broke again,839014,116626456,"Kentrell DeSean Gaulden (born October 20, 1999), better known by his stage name YoungBoy Never Broke Again (aka NBA YoungBoy), is a Baton Rouge, LA rapper.

YoungBoy started writing and making music around the age of fourteen, eventually dropping his first mixtape Life Before Fame in April of 2015.

YoungBoy started to gain recognition when he dropped his projects Mind Of A Menace 3, Before I Go, and 38 Baby, but gained the most recognition for his hit song “38 Baby.”

Shortly after the success of “38 Baby” Young Boy was arrested on November 28, 2016, and was charged with two counts of attempted second-degree murder in connection with a drive-by shooting which occurred November 7, 2016. YoungBoy ended up being sentenced to a ten-year suspended prison sentence after serving six months in prison.

After YoungBoy was released from jail, he dropped “Untouchable” which is one of his biggest hits to date. Following the release of “Untouchable,” YoungBoy released AI YoungBoy on August 4, 2017.

Later on, in 2017 YoungBoy ended the year by dropping Ain’t Too Long and started 2018 by releasing his debut studio album, Until Death Call My Name.

Nowadays YoungBoy has come up with more famous tracks such as “Drawing Symbols,” “Lil Top,” “House Arrest Tingz” and “Around”. These have appeared on albums as AI Youngboy II, Still Flexin', Still Steppin' and Top.

On March 25, 2021, the rapper was taken into custody by the FBI on an outstanding federal warrant for drug and weapon charges which date back to 2016. While locked up, YoungBoy’s team released the rapper’s third studio album, Sincerely, Kentrell, on September 24, 2021: it was originally set to be released in May of the same year. Nearly a month after, on October 22, YoungBoy was released from jail on a $500K bond and is currently placed on house arrest in Utah.

Ending 2021, YoungBoy partnered with the fellow Louisiana native, Birdman to present the two artists' joint mixtape, From The Bayou which would peak at #19 on the Billboard 200.

Beginning 2022 to a ferocious start, YoungBoy would begin to diss King Von on songs such as “Bring The Hook,” and “Fish Scale.” These songs would soon appear on YoungBoy’s eighteenth mixtape, Colors which would later peak at #2 on the Billboard 200.

Later in the year, just a month afterward, YoungBoy would find himself in a viral controversy with the Chicago native, Lil Durk as both of them exchanged brutal disses from Durk’s “AHHH HA,” to YoungBoy’s “I Hate YoungBoy” — both regarding the death of King Von.

Following his hastily start to 2022, YoungBoy would partner up with DaBaby to present the duo’s joint mixtape, BETTER THAN YOU in March. The mixtape would later peak at #10 on the Billboard 200, this would mark YoungBoy’s ninth top ten.

On April 1, 2022, continuing his victorious run, YoungBoy would release The Last Slimeto Sampler, a sample album for his August release, The Last Slimeto. This album would mark YoungBoy’s final album with Atlantic Records.

On July 15, 2022, YoungBoy was found not guilty of his federal guns charge. In a interview on Instagram, YoungBoy announced that he and his team were planning to go on tour.

As planned, on August 5, 2022, YoungBoy released The Last Slimeto which would mark his last album with Atlantic Records, completing the contract. The album would also peak at #1 on the Billboard 200 marking his fifth #1 album. The project would also break a tie with Taylor Swift as it scored a #1 album in each of the past four years.

On September 6, 2022, YoungBoy released Realer 2 as a surprise release, it is presented as a sequel to his December 2018, Realer. Just over a month following the release of Realer 2, YoungBoy released the Juvenile-influenced mixtape, 3800 Degrees which would peak at #12 on the Billboard 200. Two weeks prior to the release of 3800 Degrees, YoungBoy would release yet another mixtape hosted by DJ Drama as a part of his Gangsta Grillz series titled Ma’ I Got A Family.

Through Billboard, on October 24, 2022, it was announced that following YoungBoy’s departure from Atlantic Records, beginning 2023, he would release music under a joint venture deal between his own Never Broke Again and Motown Records. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/YoungBoy+Never+Broke+Again"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

81,ilytommy,486523,8738476,"Tommelik Ward (born March 16, 2000), better known by his stage name ilyTOMMY (formerly Haroinfather), is a rapper with very catchy and melodic songs such as “princess bubblegum,” “Forever,” and “Tunnel of Love.”

Emerging in 2017 under the alias of Haroinfather, rapper Tommelik Ward debuted with a distinctly lo-fi rap sound: gloomy tracks like ""Lonely Nights"" and ""Slave to the Hurt"" were characterized by their muffled vocals, pained stories, and themes of inner turmoil. Through the early stages of 2018, the rapper tested new ideas, releasing the singer-songwriter style of ""We're All Lost"" and the confident, upbeat ""Listen."" But it was on ""She's My Lover Girl"" that the rapper would find his signature sound: converting short samples into mellow, looping production, Ward used his low-toned vocals to create one- to two-minute rap ballads, lamenting lost loves and pining after the objects of his affection. The rapper's second song in this style, the jazzier ""Princess Bubblegum,"" became one of his breakout hits and by 2021, it had received over 100 million digital streams.

After closing out the year with similar tracks like ""Mia Wallace"" and ""Table for Two,"" Ward adopted a cockier sound in the early stages of 2019, working with Savage Ga$p and Keshore for the hedonistic ""It's Only Right to Fall in Love Twice"" and dropping further tracks ""Lavagirl"" and ""PEP$I."" His creative synergy with Savage Ga$p would continue in a second major hit, the Legend of Zelda-sampling ""Tunnel of Love,"" followed by the more melancholy stylings of ""Please Pick Up"" and ""Us vs. the World."" A third major hit, ""Forever,"" arrived shortly after: with its evocative sample of Yuna's ""Lullabies,"" the track spun troubled romances and personal struggles into an intoxicating blend and soon garnered more than 100 million streams online.

Ward moved into 2020 alongside Savage Ga$p: the duo dropped ""Maybe It's for the Best,"" and the ""Tunnel of Love (Remix)"" in late 2019, before collaborating on tracks ""Like Dat"" and ""I'm Drunk and I Miss You Too"" in early 2020. A few solo tracks, including the vocally led ""Jennifer's Body,"" closed out the year before the rapper continued into 2021 with tracks ""Paris Hilton"" and ""Tinkerbell.""

He built his love-driven rap sounds on bare-bones samples and narratives of conflicted romance. His mellow approach to the genre found a major following in the early 2020s, with tracks like ""Forever"" and ""Princess Bubblegum"" racking up more than 100 million streams apiece. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/ilyTOMMY"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

86,yk osiris,188586,1504171,"Coming into the spotlight at the tender age of 18, Florida rapper/R&B vocalist YK Osiris was quickly discovered by the higher ranks of the music industry after self-releasing just a few of his songs online. After quickly signing a deal with Def Jam on the strength of his 2018 single ""Valentine,"" the young artist plotted out the next steps of his career, the first of which was working hard on a debut album.

Osiris Williams was born in Jacksonville, Florida in 1998. Growing up with a passion for old-school soul, classic R&B, and modern pop and rap sounds, he started making music of his own at a young age. He first uploaded songs under the name Osiris, posting his single, ""Fake Love,"" in 2017 before taking on the YK Osiris moniker for future productions. ""I'm Next (Freestyle)"" was released in January of 2018, quickly going viral and collecting millions of streams. The buzz around the young rapper began to draw attention from the record industry and this interest was further stoked by the release of his next single, ""Valentine,"" two months later. ""Valentine"" was an even bigger hit, amassing over nine million streams within several weeks of its release.

1) Miguel Duran:
Hearing the sounds of his father's instrumental harmonies and melodic tunes before his birth would only make it natural for Miguel Duran to bear the innate ability to follow in his own father's footsteps as a musician. On September 24th, 1981 in Washington DC, Miguel Duran was born. His father would make it a point to teach Miguel everything he knew about music. He knew it wouldn't be an easy task to raise a kid in a cruel harsh world, but he had faith that music would show him the right path.
Listening to the cling and the clatter of the timbales in salsa and Merengue on a vinyl LP in his living room, is where Miguel would learn who great singers such as Frankie Ruiz, Juan Luis Guerra, Hector Lavo, and others were that had a tremendous impact in his own culture, in Latin music. Outside of his home, Miguel would be known as Fuego. On the streets speakers would fill the air with strong beats and rattle the houses with bass sounds showing a thunderous demonstration of love for hip-hop and rap. He'd learn who Biggie Smalls, Tu-Pac, Bone Thugs, and Big Pun were. He'd listen intensely to their style and the way they would flow with their unforgettable rhymes and cherished hooks. The street was his classroom, and his main subject was hip-hop. Within those two worlds is where Fuego would look within himself and make his distinctive style of music.
In 1998 he formed part of a group called 3MEN2 (Tremendo). The group tried very hard to work together and to take their music to the public. However, times were difficult. Each member had to think about how they were going to sustain themselves before following their true passion, music. Unfortunately, everyone decided to go separate ways. Nevertheless, Fuego didn't let that become a reason to give up. He knew that music was his calling. He began to write song after song and tried to get onto as many recordings around his way. He was then given the chance to perform solo. 
In a college auditorium he had to prove to the audience that he was meant to be a star. On stage he began to astonish his audience, with his mesmerizing lyrics and his incredible hooks. The girls started to chant Fuego's name, and music became his enlightenment. Fuego also discovered that his key to his music would be to romanticize his female audience. Music had become his motivation, his fuel. 
Along his path he met DJ Menace. DJ Menace knew that Fuego had potential and the drive to make it in the music industry. He began to help him gain exposure in the area. Menace would book him on local radio stations and shows around Maryland and DC. Menace didn't just introduce Reggaeton to DC and Maryland but he also introduced Fuego to the area. Fuego began to gain recognition in the area by performing every week. With the help from DJ Menace he was getting the practice he needed to one day perform nationwide. Sadly, DJ Menace was involved in a fatal car accident in 2003. Fuego was struck by the news but was given another reason to keep performing. His luck would soon change with his encounter of a very well known duo in the Reggaeton genre, in which would help Fuego's path in his musical career. 
One evening in one of Fuego's performances, a member of Plan B watched his show. Fuego's undeniable talent amazed Chencho. Chencho knew he had to work with him and introduced him to Boy Wonder a well-known producer in the genre. . Boy Wonder was also highly impressed with his exceptional style, and was convinced Fuego could take the genre to the next step. Fuego felt that he was in the right hands and was able to record his track ""Me Gustan Todas"" featured on ""EL Draft O5"". The track became one of the top five singles of the album. Without hesitation Fuego made a decision to sign with Chosen Few Emerald Entertainment. 
Since then Fuego's been able to do collaborations with some of the heavy weights in Reggaeton and Latin Hip-hop. He's been featured in albums such as El Draft 2005, Bob Marley, and Chosen Few El Documental II. Boy Wonder can best describe him as ""Young, fresh, and multi-creative with a dynamic style of singing, rapping, and flowin. He is and will be like the title of his album ""Untouchable"". Fuego currently is working on his own album, which will be released in 2007. He will also featured on LDA, Reychesta, and Getto's albums, and more of Chosen Few productions. He believes that his purpose is ""Bringing something different to the table. Creating different and innovative sounds. Wanting to really blow up the genre, and bring out the soul in Latin hip hop.""

2) Paul Surugiu:
Fuego is not a traditional Christmas artist, but he does a good job, in my opinion singing carols on winter time. His voice is suited for this style and he has some beautiful carols. He is a pop singer, with folkloric experiences. I could not put my finger on his exact musical style and I don’t even bother to, I just listen…

113,loyle carner,434126,16235641,"Loyle Carner is an emcee from South London has been causing quite a stir following the release of his debut EP 'A Little Late’  in September of 2014. All but one track on the EP was produced by Loyle’s right hand man and live partner Rebel Kleff. The two of them create reminiscent old school hip hop with their own UK and modern influences. 

After first appearing in 2013 on Rejjie Snow’s ‘Rejovich’ EP on track ‘1992’, Loyle’s name started to make the rounds, not least to mention the track being picked up by Majestic Casual and has racked up over 700k views to date. Following the release of the ‘A Little Late’ EP, Loyle has gone on to work with the likes of Kae Tempest, Maverick Sabre, Tom Misch and multiple others, all in preparation for releases in 2015. 

With two successful UK tours now under his belt with Joey Bada$$ and Atmosphere, Loyle is set to make some serious moves on the UK circuit and abroad, with strong support coming from all over Europe, the US and Australia. Support in the UK has come from all areas, being championed on Radio 1Xtra by DJ Semtex and Phil Taggart, Huw Stephens and Lauren Laverne at Radio 1. His latest single with Kate Tempest was added to 6Music’s B-list and then bumped up to the A-List immediately after a week and has not stopped being played.

Carner released his third studio album, 'hugo', in October, 2022.

In 'hugo', there’s a central question that Loyle Carner keeps coming back to: “I’m young, Black, successful and have a platform - but where do I go next?” The answer is explored in this epic scream of a third album. With urgent delivery and gloriously widescreen production, Carner confronts both the deeply personal (“You can’t hate the roots of a tree, and not hate the tree. So how can I hate my father without hating me?) and the highly political (“I told the black man he didn’t understand I reached the white man he wouldn’t take my hand”). <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Loyle+Carner"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

114,cordae,690903,19428544,"Cordae Amari Dunston (born August 26, 1997), known mononymously as Cordae (formerly known as YBN Cordae and Entendre is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. 

Dunston gained popularity by releasing remixes of popular songs, such as ""My Name Is"" by Eminem, and ""Old N***as"" which was a response to the song ""1985"" by J. Cole. Videos to both remixes were uploaded to the WorldStarHipHop's YouTube channel, which led to an immense and immediate positive response from both mainstream media and the online rap community. His debut studio album, The Lost Boy was released on July 26, 2019 and received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 62nd Grammy Awards. Cordae was a member of the YBN collective from 2018 until the group disbanded in 2020.

Dunston was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, but moved to Suitland, Maryland. As a young child, he'd taken an interest in music as his father would always play classic hip hop around him, from artists such as Rakim, Nas, Big L, and Talib Kweli. He began writing raps around the age of fifteen, but did not take it seriously, as it was only a hobby for him. Following the influence he gained from the music his father listened to, he would do research on certain artists through YouTube, attempting to find similar music and ""getting lost"" in the recommended videos section. Dunston began gaining more interest in pursuing a rap career as he aged, but focused on his education first, although writing lyrics often distracted him from his studies. He released three mixtapes as a teenager under the name ""Entendre"" – Anxiety (2014), I’m So Anxious (2016), and I’m So Anonymous (2017). He graduated from high school in 2015 and decided to go to college at Towson University, later dropping out in 2018, explaining that college was ""bigger than him"" as a first-generation student, and he was mainly doing it for his mother. He moved to Los Angeles shortly afterward.

Dunston began taking his rap career seriously in the beginning of 2018. Although he hadn't been releasing any music with them, he'd often hang around YBN Nahmir and Almighty Jay when visiting Los Angeles, whom he'd initially met through social media. Nahmir had taken interest in a song that Dunston had made with fellow rapper and brother Simba, and reached out to him. Dunston is the only member of YBN that hadn't been introduced to everyone as a gamer, as he doesn't take gaming too seriously. He already felt like he was a part of YBN, the only thing that hadn't solidified his presence being his social media handles, which he soon changed from Entendre to YBN Cordae. He also stated that Entendre had been a name that he'd wanted to change for while, stating ""I was just always around Nahmir and shit, those were just like my brothers... And, I was thinking, yo, I need to change my shit to like, Cordae, and shit, my actual first name. I was already ""YBN"" without the social tag, you know what I'm saying?"" He released his first single, which he called his ""introduction to the world"", in May 2018. It was a remix of the 1999 song ""My Name Is"" by Eminem, which he released along with a music video via WorldStarHipHop on YouTube. Subsequently, he released ""Old N***as"", as a response to ""1985"" by J. Cole, then released the tracks Fighting Temptations and Kung Fu, respectively.

His debut live performance was at the annual Rolling Loud music festival in May 2018, in which he performed with both YBN Nahmir and Almighty Jay. He performed with the duo again for the 2018 XXL Freshman Show in New York City, after Nahmir was announced to be an inductee of the yearly freshman class. Dunston was then announced to be joining Juice WRLD on his North American WRLD Domination tour from May to September 2018, along with Lil Mosey and  Blake, ended up reaching 28 cities. Soon after, it was announced that YBN would be going on a month-long tour in Europe as a collective. Dunston then said he would release multiple singles up until his debut project is complete. On August 2, 2018, both Nahmir and Cordae released a video for their single ""Pain Away"". On August 12, YBN Nahmir announced that an official YBN Mixtape, featuring the trio, would be released September 7, 2018. He released the music video for his single, ""Scotty Pippen"", on August 23, 2018.

On January 28, 2019, Cordae released a music video for a new song titled, ""Locationships"" on his YouTube channel before releasing another song titled, ""Have Mercy"" in March 2019, with the latter song becoming the lead single from his debut studio album, The Lost Boy. He was later named as one of the members of XXL's ""2019 Freshman Class"" on June 20, 2019.[26] Cordae later released ""Bad Idea"" and ""RNP"" as the second and third singles from the album respectively. The Lost Boy was released on July 26, 2019. The album landed YBN Cordae two nominations at the 62nd Grammy Awards; Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song for the single ""Bad Idea"". In November 2019, Cordae announced that he would be headlining ""The Lost Boy in America Tour"", which began in January 2020.

On August 6, 2020, YBN Nahmir took to Twitter to announce that the YBN collective officially disbanded. Cordae subsequently dropped the YBN from his stage name. On August 27, Cordae released a new single, ""Gifted"", featuring Roddy Ricch, marking Cordae's first release of 2020. Cordae has been currently working on his second album. During an interview with Apple Music, he stated, ""I'm like a hundred songs deep in. Like this next one, I'm really taking everything to a whole 'nother level.

116,delinquent habits,222115,2535048,"Delinquent Habits (a.k.a. Los Delinquentes) is a Chicano hip-hop group. Formed in Los Angeles in 1991, they are known for their Latin-tinged rap, which is both melodic and hardcore. Their first album was executive produced by Cypress Hill member Sen Dog and featured guest appearances by Sen himself as well as Puerto Rican New York City rapper Hurricane G. Their second album, Here Come The Horns, again featured Sen Dog as well as Sen's brother, pioneering Latin rapper Mellow Man Ace. The melodic ""Merry Go Round"" featured the female singer Michelle. The group chose to focus more on hardcore rap on their fourth offering, ""Freedom Band"".

The group itself originally consisted of two MCs, Ives and Kemo, and O.G. Style as the DJ. Thus the group was often called ""Los Tres Delinquentes"" (In English: ""The Three Delinquents""). In 1996, the group garnered international success with their first single ""Tres Delinquentes"" selling over one million copies. The success of the song pushed the group's self-titled album to nearly the same figure. Kemo soon left after the completion of their album Freedom Band to pursue a solo career with some substantial success. He was replaced by female vocalist Michelle, who had been previously featured in their songs

Rapper Ives makes one thing clear right from the start: ""Delinquent Habits is no Old-School-Band, we are fresh and constantly looking for something new."" On their new album ""The Common Man"" (09.10.2009) Delinquent Habits appear fresh for the first time in ages. The vibrant beats, the hot groove and the catchy lyrics make it clear: Someone knows how to rock the stage.

In the latter half of the 90's, Delinquent Habits along with Cypress Hill made it to the very top of Latin-Hip Hop. Rapper Ives and Kemo as well as DJ O.G Style combined Hip Hop beats with Funk and Miriachi trumpets and rapped in a mixture of Spanish and English called ""Spanglish"".

In 1996 they achieved a world-wide hit with ""Tres Delinquentes"". Their debut ""Delinquent Habits"" sold over 1 million copies and has achieved ""hip hop classic"" status the success of which is noticeable until this day. Sold-out tours in Europe and in the USA and four album releases, amongst these on their own label ""Station 13, are testament to this impressive feat. Delinquent Habits live the crossover and show no reservation. The Matiachi-Rappers shared stages with different acts such as Beck, Korn and The Fugees. Their songs were used in various soundtracks, as well as computer games, not to mention sportswear giant Nike added the DelHab-Song ""Return Of The Tres"" to its TV advert which was broadcast world-wide.

After Kemo und O.G. Style pulled out, Ives is the last remaining member of the original band and now head and songwriter of Delinquent Habits. But this is no reason for Ives to mope: ""Now I am able to have an input in all aspects of our music, beginning with the lyrics to the beats to the point of who I want to work with. This way ""The Common Man"" emerged, in collaboration with different producers such as Sick Jacken (Psycho Realm), Andre Horstmann (Pet Shop Boys, All Saints) or the Superstar DJs, which injected new life and ideas into the typical Delinquent Habits sound.

Ives finds his inspiration for his lyrics on the streets of his barrio and so on his new album ""The Common Man"", there is no mistaking - more critical and harsh tones next to the typical party tunes. This is reflected perfectly in the debut track, in which Ives denounces in a wonderful play on words society’s increasing egotism and the thieving mentality of the big bosses: ""They livin high on the hog but they really just all swine''.
Nevertheless Delinquent Habits still know that there is also room for the light-hearted side to life, which is best celebrated with hot parties.

117,the alchemist,1188431,38020032,"Alan Daniel Maman (born October 25, 1977), better known as The Alchemist, is a hip-hop producer and MC. The Alchemist has been an active producer since 1991. He hails from affluent Beverly Hills, California. After rising to prominence in the late 1990s as a close associate of Dilated Peoples, he went on to produce for many of hip-hop's leading artists in the 2000s.

As a teen, Al began to identify strongly with the rebellious lyrics and urban sounds of hip-hop, and he began writing his own lyrics as a creative outlet. He joined up with other like-minded artists who wrote lyrics and rebelled strongly against their ""uptight"" suburban surroundings, among whom were Shifty Shellshock of Crazy Town, Evidence of Dilated Peoples and Scott Caan, son of James Caan. They would often hang out in urban areas of Los Angeles and participated in typical teenage rebellious activities like partying, smoking marijuana, and general mischief.

Al and Scott decided to become a duo named The Whooliganz. While rhyming at a party in L.A., they attracted the attention of B-Real of Cypress Hill. He invited the teens to join his crew, The Soul Assassins, which also included the groups House of Pain and Funkdoobiest. In 1993, the Whooliganz released their first single, ""Put Your Handz Up."" The song received little radio airplay and their record label, Tommy Boy Records, decided to shelve their album. Rejected, Scott focused his creative energy on acting while Al became interested in process of making hip-hop beats.

DJ Muggs took Al under his wing and taught him how to use a sampler and mixing board. After helping to produce a few tracks for Cypress Hill, Al became the main producer for his childhood friend, Evidence and his group Dilated Peoples. When Dilated debuted in 1998, they were an underground sensation creating a huge buzz about the man behind those incredible beats.

In 1999, Muggs introduced Al to his good friends, the popular hip-hop group Mobb Deep. Al produced two songs for their Murda Muzik album. Impressed by his production skills and street smarts, Mobb Deep took him under their wing, using his beats on all their subsequent albums. As Alchemist's profile increased, he went on to produce for many of hip hop's most successful and prominent artists, such as Nas, Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Ghostface Killah and Snoop Dogg. He has also remixed songs for bands and artists in other genres such as Linkin Park and Morcheeba. Al stayed loyal to his old friends, continuing to produce for Dilated, Cypress Hill, Everlast (formerly of House of Pain) and Crazy Town. He also enjoys producing for lesser-known underground rappers, often giving them some of his best beats. In 2004, 11 years after his rapping career folded, The Alchemist returned with his long-awaited debut album, ""1st Infantry."" The album yielded the hit single ""Hold You Down"" (featuring Prodigy, Illa Ghee, and Nina Sky), which hit number ninety-five on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2005.

Alchemist was the official tour DJ for Eminem on his 2005 Anger Management 3 Tour, replacing the recently-ousted DJ Green Lantern. However on July 13, 2005, the tour bus carrying Eminem's entourage (including rapper Stat Quo as well as Alchemist) swerved off the road and turned over. Alchemist was treated for broken ribs and a collapsed lung.

The Alchemist is one of the music producers behind the video game Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars released by Rockstar Games. He was also on Tim Westwood TV, when Eminem, Royce Da 5'9"" and Mr. Porter freestyled. During an interview with Worldwide Conspiracy Radio, The Alchemist revealed he would be dropping a 2-part project with fellow West Coast producer Oh No entitled Gangrene, the first to be released in July, the second in November, both on Decon. Alchemist was also the DJ for the Eminem set on the BBC1 chat-show Jonathan Ross on June 4, 2010.

Alchemist is Eminem's official DJ, since DJ Green Lantern departed from Shady Records in 2005 because of a dispute related to the feud of 50 Cent and Jadakiss. In 2006, Eminem released a collaboration album with Shady Records called Eminem Presents: The Re-Up. Since the Alchemist is his official DJ, he produced some of the tracks on the mixtape, as well as compiling the album in a mixtape fashion. On December 18, 2013, he was named the runner-up for Producer of the Year by HipHopDX. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Alchemist"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1. Elmo Kennedy O'Connor, known professionally as Bones, is an American rapper from Howell, Michigan. He is notable for the frenetic pace at which he releases new music, including over 40 mix tapes and 88 music videos since 2011, and his resistance to signing with a major record label or charging money for his music despite significant popularity and label interest. Born to a mother who designed clothing and a father who was a web designer. His grandfather was actor Robert Culp. When Bones was 7 years old, his family moved to Howell, Michigan. When he was 16, he dropped out of high school and moved to Los Angeles where his brother, Elliott, had already been living.

He has collaborated on three tracks with Raider Klan member Eddy Baker, including “High”, “Delinquents”, and “PayPal” off of Bones's albums Saturn (2013), Creep (2013), and Garbage (2014). Bones also performs and collaborates often with Xavier Wulf and another former Raider Klan member Chris Travis.

In 2014, Bones self-released 5 mixtapes through his label TeamSesh, including Garbage, which received coverage and critical acclaim from notable publications including The Fader, Pigeons & Planes, and RESPECT.
Bones headlined a sold out show at the House of Blues in Los Angeles on March 4, 2015. and opened for Shlohmo at The Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles on May 7, 2015. The hook from Bones' song ""Dirt"" was featured in ASAP Rocky's ""Canal St."" on the 2015 At. Long. Last. ASAP album.

Bones and his manager Elliott O’Connor, who is also his brother, have both stated that major labels have shown interest in signing him but he has declined up to this point. According to Max Bell of LA Weekly, ""interested labels wanted him to be their 'white rapper,' an artist along the lines of Mac Miller and Machine Gun Kelly. But Bones wasn't interested in being remade.

4.  Part performance artist, part ego drenched rock star, Bones rips delta blues with punks intensity, and throws in a little stripper jazz for colour. With the delivery of a storefront preacher, The Man Named Bones (the alter ego of one Michael Miller) sings, screams and growls Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll with tongue firmly in cheek. Armed with an upright bass, an electric guitar, a sampler and a drum machine, Bones is a one man blues/punk machine.

5. Bones was an untitled noise project released on the French static noise / HNW label Slow Death Music, believed to by Julien Skrobek.

123,lil uzi vert,2203863,318255897,"Symere Bysil Woods (born July 31, 1995, Philadelphia, USA), known professionally as Lil Uzi Vert, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. Characterized by their face tattoos, facial piercings, eccentric hairstyles, and androgynous fashion, their music is often defined by dark subject matters and imagery built on a melodic emo approach to trap.

They attracted mainstream attention following the release of their debut single ""Money Longer"" in 2016. The song would act as the lead single for the subsequent mixtape ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World"". After releasing two additional mixtapes in 2016 and 2017, including one in collaboration with Gucci Mane, Lil Uzi Vert was featured on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. They later secured their first top 10 single with ""XO Tour Llif3"", which won the MTV Video Music Award for Song of the Summer.

""XO Tour Llif3"" acted as the lead single to Lil Uzi Vert's debut studio album ""Luv Is Rage 2"" (2017), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 2018 Grammy Awards, Lil Uzi Vert was nominated for Best New Artist. Their second studio album ""Eternal Atake"" (2020) was among the most anticipated albums in hip hop and peaked at number one on the Billboard 200.

2010–2015: Career beginnings
Woods began to rap in 2010 and began to associate with musical groups like Steaktown, in what he said was ""just for money"", under the name ""Sealab Vertical"". They later changed their name to Lil Uzi Vert from the way someone described their rap flow, saying their flow was ""Fast, like a machine gun"". Woods' first project, an EP titled ""Purple Thoughtz Vol. 1"", was released on January 19, 2014. The project, which was described as ""phonk"" and having cloud rap beats due to its psychedelic and ""trippy"" production, features a bigger focus on lyricism and was released with the single ""White Shit"". The track, produced by Spaceghostpurrp, went viral in 2017 within hip-hop circles following Woods' entry into the mainstream. Shortly after the release of their first project, Woods caught the attention of then industry-mainstays like Mob.

The EP and following features caught the attention of producer and cofounder of Atlantic Records Don Cannon after DJ Diamond Kuts played one of their songs on a local radio station. Cannon then produced and hosted their first mixtape, ""The Real Uzi"", which was released on August 5, 2014. After the release of ""The Real Uzi"", Woods signed a record deal with Atlantic Records through DJ Drama, Don Cannon's, and Leighton Morrison's imprint, Generation Now.

Following their signing to Atlantic Records, Woods was featured alongside Kid and Ferg on Carnage's single ""WDYW"". They also released several songs on SoundCloud including ""No Wait"", produced by Metro Booming, ""Pressure"", which is a collaboration with Durk, and  ''Loaf"". He was featured on Fall Out Boy and Khalifa's ""Boys of Zummer"" tour in August 2015.

Woods released their second mixtape, ""Luv Is Rage"" on October 30, 2015. The project was received positively and was featured on numerous music blogs such as Fader, XXL, and Vibe. They were further called a ""breakout artist of 2015"" by HotNewHipHop.

2016: Breakthrough
In February 2016, they released the single, ""Money Longer"" on their SoundCloud following a radio debut on Shade 45. 

On April 15, 2016, Vert released their third mixtape and first commercial mixtape ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World"". The mixtape debuted at number 37 on the Billboard 200 chart, making it their first entry on said chart. The project spent 55 weeks on the Billboard 200, eventually being certified Gold. Lil Uzi Vert and Kapri embarked on a joint tour in May 2016, titled the ""Parental Advisory"" tour.

In June 2016, Uzi appeared in XXL magazine as part of their 2016 Freshmen Class. As part of this appearance, Uzi performed a ‘freshman cypher’ alongside Denzel Curry, Lil Yachty, 21 Savage, and Kodak Black. Riding the wave of recognition the XXL Freshman list gave them, Woods released the video for the single ""Money Longer"" which debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 the following week, their first entry on the chart, at number 92 on July 2, 2016. The song later peaked at number 54 and is currently certified two times platinum in the United States. Woods' second entry on the chart, ""You Was Right"", debuted at 89 on July 30, 2016  and peaked at number 40.

On July 12, 2016, Woods announced their fourth mixtape, ""The Perfect LUV Tape"", which was released on July 31, their 22nd birthday. The mixtape featured the singles ""Seven Million"", featuring Future, and ""Erase Your Social"", both of which failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. The mixtape debuted at number 55 on the Billboard 200 album chart and is certified Gold by the RIAA. In October 2016, Woods was announced to be an additional artist on The Weeknd's ""Starboy: legend of the Fall"" tour.

Lil Uzi Vert announced a collaboration mixtape with Gucci Mane titled ""1017 vs. The World"", which was released on November 23, 2016. On the 27th, Uzi announced ""Luv Is Rage 2"" which went through a series of delays.

2017: Luv Is Rage 2
Uzi was featured on Migos' single ""Bad and Boujee"". The single was released on August 31, 2016, and its from the trio's second studio album ""Culture"". In January 2017, around the time the album was released, the single reached the top of the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Uzi's first number 1 single as a lead or featured artist, and their highest charting single as both. On February 27, 2017, Woods released the EP ""Luv Is Rage 1.5"" while on tour with The Weeknd. The EP was positively received for its ""nerdy"" nature, with Kingdom Hearts themed instrumentals and lyrics referring to anime, Steven Universe, and hentai. The EP was also credited as the start of Uzi's affiliation with the ""emo-rapper"" label due to the heartbreak-associated lyrics on the song ""Luv Scars K.o 1600"" and references to threats of suicide and depression on the stand-out track ""XO Tour Llif3"".

""XO Tour Llif3"" got significant popularity on SoundCloud, resulting in Uzi playing it live on the European leg of The Weeknd's tour, and the following week the song was added to streaming services and released as an official single. On April 4, 2017, ""Xo Tour Llif3"" debuted on Billboard Hot 100 at number 49 and peaked at number 7, becoming the rapper's highest charting song and biggest song, being certified 6x platinum as of August 2018.

""Luv Is Rage 2"" was delayed again on April 2, 2017, with Uzi blaming it on DJ Drama. On April 9, Don Cannon confirmed the project wasn't getting released ""any time soon"" and confirmed that ""XO Tour Llif3"" would be on the album. Uzi was featured on fellow rapper Playboi Carti's single ""wokeuplikethis*"", released on April 7. The single was performed by the pair at Coachella 2017.

""wokeuplikethis*"" was eventually certified platinum and peaked at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100. Uzi was featured alongside ASAP Rocky, Playboi Carti, Quavo, and Frank Ocean on A$AP rappers collective Mob's single ""RAF"". The single was released by surprise on May 15, 2017. In early August, hip-hop media personality DJ Akademiks claimed that ""Luv Is Rage 2"" would be released within 30 days. On August 24, 2017, ""Luv Is Rage 2"" was announced for a surprise release at midnight, and on August 25, 2017, Lil Uzi Vert released their heavily delayed debut studio album, which included ""XO TOUR Llif3"" as the lead single.

The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart, with 135,000 album-equivalent units, and has since been certified platinum. The album also created ten Billboard Hot 100 charting singles, with two of them, ""The Way Life Goes"" and ""Sauce It Up"", becoming singles. During british singer Ed Sheeran's set at the Video Music Awards, Uzi Vert and Sheeran performed a medley of ""XO Tour Llif3"" and Sheeran's chart-topping single, ""Shape Of You"".

In September 2017, Woods teased a possible sequel project to ""Lil Uzi Vert vs The World"", possibly titled ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World 2"", and a collaboration project with Playboi Carti titled ""16*29"". In October, a joint tour with Playboi Carti called the ""16*29 tour"" was announced, further promoting the possibility of a collaboration project. The tour was canceled shortly thereafter due to Uzi claiming he needed to ""focus"". In October 2017, Uzi headlined Power 105.1's annual Powerhouse music celebration alongside The Weeknd, Migos, and Cardi B, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Uzi was also featured on Canadian rapper Nav's platinum-certified single ""Wanted You"". The song was released on November 3, 2017.

On December 4, 2017, ""The Way Life Goes"" music video was released with a remix featuring Nicki Minaj. The song peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Hot 100. Uzi Vert performed the song on Stephen Colbert's The Late Show on February 6, 2018.

They were featured alongside Kanye West on Travis Scott's song, ""Watch"", which was released on May 3, 2018. ""Watch"" debuted at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. They were also featured on a remix for fellow rapper Lil Tracy's single ""Like a Farmer"".

2018–2020: Eternal Atake, Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World 2, and Pluto x Baby Pluto

In January 2018, Uzi announced that he had completed a mixtape with record producer Wheezy. In May 2018, Don Cannon confirmed that a new Uzi project was dropping that year and speculation arose in July 2018 when Uzi tweeted the words ""Eternal Atake"", the title of their second studio album, pinning the tweet and announcing it was ""coming soon"", then at the end of the month sharing the then-chosen cover art for the project. The art referenced the logo of the cult Heavens Gate. The two members who survived the cult suggested that legal actions could be taken against Uzi for copying the logo style.

The art was the source of a threat from the remaining members of the organization over a legal attack. The then-thought lead single for the album, ""New Patek"" was released on September 18, 2018. Uzi was then featured on Lil Pump's single, ""Multi Millionaire"". The single was released on October 5, 2018.

In April 2019, following label trouble with Generation Now, it was announced that Uzi was now signed to Roc Nation. Two new promotional singles were released in April 2019, titled ""Sanguine Paradise"" and ""That's a Rack"", originally thought to be from their highly anticipated studio album, ""Eternal Atake"".

On December 13, 2019, Uzi released a new single titled ""Futsal Shuffle 2020"", which is the lead single of ""Eternal Atake"". The rapper then released the second single of the album, ""That Way"", on March 1, 2020.

""Eternal Atake"" was released on March 6, 2020, with a sole guest appearance from American singer Syd. ""New Patek"", ""That's a Rack"" and ""Sanguine Paradise"" did not appear on the album. ""Eternal Atake"" debuted atop the Billboard 200.

On March 12, 2020, Lil Uzi teased that the deluxe version of ""Eternal Atake"" and the sequel to their 2016 mixtape, ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World"", titled ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World 2"", would be released the following day, the date fans expected the release date of the original album.

The deluxe edition would have fourteen new tracks, featuring guest appearances from Chief Keef, 21 Savage, Future, Young Thug, Gunna, Lil Durk, Young Nudy, and Nav. The first half of the album maintained a leading number 1 position with 400 million streams in early 2020. This marked the largest streaming count for any album since 2018, when Lil Wayne's twelfth studio album, ""Tha Carter V"", got 433 million streams.

On April 24, 2020, Lil Uzi Vert released a new single titled ""Sasuke"". On July 10, Lil Uzi appeared on the remix of StaySolidRocky's ""Party Girl"". On July 21, Lil Uzi and Future hinted at an upcoming joint project titled ""Pluto x Baby Pluto"" on their social medias; it was released on November 13, 2020, and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200.

2021–2022: Subsequent ventures
In late 2020, Lil Uzi Vert began promoting new singles on Instagram Live that were sonically similar to popular releases early on in their career. He announced an upcoming project titled ""Forever Young"", as well as a follow-up to ""Luv Is Rage 2"".

From the 16th to the 22nd of july 2022, Uzi released 4 songs from their EP, RED & WHITE on their SoundCloud account day by day, then, on the 22nd, the rest of the EP was released.

2023 - Present
In June 2023, Uzi noted that the album would be released that same month. On the 17th, Uzi had taken to Instagram to post an alternate cover art to the project. He  also announced that the cover art would release in ""a couple of days"" and that the tracklist would release ""this week,"" while confirming the release date of June 30.

On June 26, 2023, Uzi revealed the cover art and the release date on their website and simultaneously released the Gibson Hazard directed trailer for the album. Days prior to it's official announcement, Uzi threw an album release party — which he named “The Pink Tape Prom” — in which he previewed several tracks from the project.

On June 30, 2023, Lil Uzi Vert released the highly anticipated album, ""Pink Tape"". The album contains guest appearances from Travis Scott, Nicki Minaj, Bring Me The Horizon, Don Toliver, and Babymetal. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/LIL+UZI+VERT"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

128,moro,16896,304742,"Moro is one of two artists:

1) Hardcore arranger, principal arranger of KINZOK ON from Japan.
Also known as morrrrrro
KINZOK ON bandcamp: https://kinzokon.bandcamp.com/music
MORO on Twitter: https://twitter.com/moro_108


2) Moro is a beast composed of two reasonably-sentient beings: Nolan Thomas and Daniel Lee Ruff Smith, and born in the hills surrounding a village known as Eau Claire, WI. The beast is sometimes called ""M o r o"", or ""M O R O"" by different tribes.

After writhing in front of crowds of jubilant townsfolk a few times, and Lee Ruff taking a brief absence to travel to the Land of Thais, it regurgitated it's first offspring-- ""Embers""-- in a fiery cough. The townsfolk went mad for it, but it was too jittery to stay in one place, so it travelled throughout the globe on the back of the root-god Pando, whom some know as The Interwebs, among other names. The child was aided in it's travels by MJMJ Records and many friends.

Then Lee Ruff heard callings from afar, and split from it's Nolan-half to gain knowledge in the far off land of España for one half an earth cycle. Though less powerful due to their separation, the two beings were able to communicate with the aid of their friend-god Pando, speaking into his roots and sensing the vibrations on the other end. 

With a seed planted in their minds by the ancient tree-and-worker guardians, Simon & Garfunkel, they combined their powers and dreamed into existence their second child, ""Sound of Silence"". This child was requested of them by the Pando-rider Cactus-Mouth, who then took it forth along the roots and raised it as his own. 

It was then that Nolan-half began to feel unsatisfied with his choice to study the ancient and time-honored craft of Illustration, and made leave from the temple of UW-Eau Claire, at least for a time. With his newfound freedom and an approaching 21st birth-festival, his mother, Keli, offered forth the means for Nolan-half to visit the city København, in the realm of Danmark-- close to the Witch Woods of Sverige, where the Old Gods dwell. He sought refuge with his pal-being Mirko, and stayed in the living room of two wonderful she-Danes. 

By some chance of fate, Lee Ruff was also in the region, and the two beings were able to briefly reunite in the north-country of Uppsala, deep within the Witch Woods of Sverige. It was a long and perilous journey for Nolan-half, battling Sex-Trolls and SJ Railways, and his ability to communicate with Pando grew weak, causing many confusions. But through it all, he eventually found the Lee Ruff, and all was merry. Moro stomped as one through the halls of Upsalla by day, and gazed into it's clear pools by night, discussing with reasonable-sentience the nature of The Creator or The Great Unknown. Cats and ducks came to listen in and gain knowledge, but were keen to hide their own sentience. 

Alas, Moro was forced to split once again, returning to Eau Claire and España respectively. Nolan-half used up all his coins on food and travel in Danmark and Sverige, and now really really needs to get a job.

The two halves of Moro have resolved to sleep until June of the earth-cycle 2011, when they can be reunited once more in the village Eau Claire, and writhe for crowds and spew forth new offspring, and send them forth into the world with Pando and alive with Moro's magical instruments, and travel throughout the land with village-friends and make many many anew. The beast will be unstoppable. maybe. It will never stop dreaming.

single ""Ooouuu"". Young M.A was born in 1992 in Brooklyn , New York . At the age of 9, she began rapping. Over the next nine years, she was residing in Virginia , although never staying in one place for long, moving to several cities while in the South. At the age of 16, she moved back to Brooklyn. 

Young M.A started rapping by a corner store when she was young after a few years her music career started , when she was self-funding its recording studio with local record producers , after she was working at Shake Shack and T.J. Maxx. [4] In 2014, she gained notoriety, when a Facebook post criticizing her song, called ""Brooklyn Chiraq"" that went viral. [5] The post's author, pundit Boyce Watkins, said the song promoted ""violent, negative, genocidal energy"", but the controversy expanded Young M.A's name recognition and brought in some new listeners to her work. [3] In 2015, Young M.A released a new song, called ""Body Bag"", which became a ""YouTube hit"" said Rolling Stone, [5] along with the release of her mixtape, called Sleep Walkin ', which MTV describes as a ""thoughtful debut project"". 
In 2016, Young M.A released her official debut single, called ""Ooouuu"", [4] which peaked at number 19 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. [7] In September 2016, the song nearly had 7 million plays on Spotify [8] and was widely remixed, with other rappers and hip hop artists such as French Montana, Remy Ma, Jadakiss , Uncle Murda , ASAP Ferg and Tink , who all of them were putting out their versions to that song. [3] At Stereogum , Tom Breihan said ""Ooouuu"" was ""a brash, intense, hard-as-fuck piece of rider music...the song feels like it marks the arrival of a major rap talent."" [9]

The Fader said Young M.A has ""establishe[d] herself as a quintessential New York MC"", [10] and at MTV, Doreen St. Félix said, ""This summer, the atmosphere belongs to Young M.A and her single 'OOOUUU.'"" [6] The song's popularity drew attention from labels, [11] though M.A remains an independent artist.
At the 2016's BET Hip Hop Awards , she did a freestyle on a cypher and performed her single, ""Ooouuu"", giving what XXL Magazine described as ""show-stopping freestyle...one of the best freestyles of the night""; despite the enthusiasm for her performance, Young M.A expressed disappointment, saying BET cut out a portion of her performance. 

In 2016, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Young M.A said she'd been offered the role of Frieda Gatz on
Empire , but turned it down, preferring to pursue her own career as a rapper instead of being known first as a fictional character.

Young M.A is a lesbian, a topic that she includes in her music. She told Vogue that coming out had been an important point in her artistic development, saying ""I held in being sexually attracted to women for so long that once I got that out of me, the music became easy.""[3] On September 26th 2009, her brother was murdered by a member of his own gang.

Jacquees participated in his first talent show in fifth grade at Canby Lane Elementary School performing the Jackson 5's, ""I Want You Back,"" winning 1st place. He successfully matriculated to Mary McCleod Bethune Middle School where he continued to compete in talent shows winning every year; two at Bethune Middle and one at the Dekalb County Middle School Talent Show. 

In 2007, Jacquees was introduced to his manager, Orlando Grind, by Dexx Lee. After years of performing in local talent shows, Orlando soon introduced him to Russell ""Block"" Spencer, founder and CEO of Block Entertainment. When Jacquees started going to the studio he merely blended with the team and wasn't given the opportunity to express his true talents. ""When you see work being done around you but not for you, you tend to get discouraged,"" says Jacquees. At that time, Block's focus was only rap, not R&B. It wasn't until summer of 2009 when Block witnessed how talented Jacquees was and shifted his vision. Jacquees began to work closely with Block Entertainment recording and gaining more exposure with the release of his first single ""Krazy"" featuring Grand Hustle's own, T.I. 

Jacquees has recorded with label mates, Gorilla Zoe and Scotty, T.I.P, and an upcoming Atlanta rapper, J-Real. Jacquees dreams to work with established artist Lil Wayne, Drake, Justin Bieber, Bow Wow, Lil' Chuckee, Chris Brown, and many more. ""All of these artists started out at the age I am and are successful in the industry. I look up to them and dream that I will be just as successful as they are,"" Jacquees explains. ""Only better!"" 

""It's truly a blessing to have the opportunity to work with the artist and producers I have already worked with,"" says Jacquees. ""I pray to God every night that I continue on this journey and achieve what I've always dreamed of doing. With God on my side, I know this is only the beginning and there is more to come."" With that in mind, Jacquees will achieve any and everything he wants out of the music industry.

165,don toliver,1792340,142399864,"Caleb Zackery “Don” Toliver (born June 12, 1994), is a rapper, singer, and songwriter from Houston, Texas. Toliver began his musical career in May 2017, releasing the collaborative mixtape Playa Familia with friend and fellow rapper Yungjosh93.

Don Toliver’s solo debut came just a few months later, with the debut singles “I Gotta” and “Diva” dropping in November and December, respectively. The singles quickly caught the ear of Atlantic Records, which signed Toliver to the label in March 2018. Under Atlantic, he released his major-label debut album, Donny Womack.

While working on the tape, Toliver caught the attention of fellow Houston native Travis Scott, who invited the young rapper to Hawaii to work on a song on his then-upcoming third studio album, ASTROWORLD. Eagerly accepting, the sessions landed Toliver a feature on the album’s thirteenth track, “CAN’T SAY” by Travis Scott, as well as inspiring him to record much of the material for Donny Womack.

On August 3, 2018, the same day as Travis released his album, he gave a major cosign to Toliver on Twitter:
Coincidentally, on August 2, 2018, Toliver dropped his own project Donny Womack the day before ASTROWORLD.

Genius caught up with the rising Houston artist just a few days before ASTROWORLD’s release to discuss his relationship with Travis, going to Hawaii for the ASTROWORLD sessions, and his hopes for Donny Womack, as his profile gets a dramatic boost.

When Genius asked him about how he met Travis and his relationship with him, he replied:

""When I first started linking up with Travis, somebody from my camp reached out to somebody in his camp. I sent them music and videos and it got to Travis and he was feeling it. He came back and we were able to link up and vibe.""

In May 2019, he released his single “No Idea”, the lead single of his March 2020 debut studio album, Heaven Or Hell. “No Idea” got its popularity from the viral social media app, TikTok, on all the lip-sync and dance videos on the app.

In December 2019, JACKBOYS (Cactus Jack Records members) and Travis Scott released their compilation album, JACKBOYS. On the album, Toliver has a track, titled “Had Enough” (also on Heaven Or Hell), featuring Quavo and Offset from the hip-hop trio Migos. He was also featured on another track by JACKBOYS and Travis, titled “WHAT TO DO?” from the album. He, Travis, and Luxury Tax provided vocals on another track by JACKBOYS and Sheck Wes, titled “GANG GANG”.

On January 17, 2020, Toliver took another big leap in his career. American rapper Eminem released his eleventh studio album, Music to Be Murdered By, in which Toliver featured on the eighteenth track, “No Regrets”. The song’s producer, D.A. Doman, recruited Toliver to record and sing the chorus at the “last minute”.

On March 13, 2020, Toliver released Heaven Or Hell, his debut studio album through Cactus Jack Records and Atlantic Records. It contains features from Travis Scott, Kaash Paige, Quavo, Offset, and Sheck Wes.

168,50 cent,4195721,87048286,"Curtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975 in South Jamaica, Queens, New York), better known by his stage name 50 Cent, is a Grammy award nominated rapper, actor, singer, entrepreneur, author and founder of the hip hop group and label G-Unit. 

Jackson was born and raised in South Jamaica, a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. His mother Sabrina, a drug dealer, died in a fire when he was 8. Since his father had already abandoned the family, young Curtis was sent to live with his grandparents. Growing up during the crack epidemic of the 80s and 90s, Jackson dealt drugs when he wasn't ""killing time"" at school or boxing at a local gym. His grandparents assumed he was at after-school programs when he was out selling crack. In tenth grade, Jackson was caught with guns and drug money passing through the metal detectors at Andrew Jackson High School in Queens. In 1994, Jackson was arrested again for selling vials of cocaine to an undercover officer, and three weeks later he was arrested yet-again after police found heroin, crack cocaine, and a starter pistol in his home. Jackson was sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison, but opted to join a 6 month boot camp program and get his GED. Around this time, Jackson began going by ""50 Cent,"" inspired by deceased Brooklyn stick-up man Kelvin ""50 Cent"" Martin. 

After leaving drug dealing to pursue a rap career, he released his debut album Guess Who's Back Again in 2002. He was discovered by Eminem and Dr. Dre and then signed to Interscope Records. He has since released Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2003), The Massacre (2006), Curtis (2007) and Before I Self Destruct (2009).

50 Cent has engaged in feuds with other rappers including Jay-Z, Ja Rule, The Game, Cam'ron, Fat Joe, and Rick Ross. He has also pursued an acting career, appearing in the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin' in 2005, the Iraq War film Home of the Brave in 2006, and Righteous Kill in 2008. 50 Cent is one of the richest hip-hop performers, having a net worth estimated at US $440 million in 2008.

Before 50 Cent ever inked a major deal, he built up a substantial fan base in New York through underground mixtapes. 50 Cent met up with Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC and was signed to his label to write all of Jay’s music. After he’d left JMJ, he signed to Columbia Records in 1996. On this label, he released Power of the Dollar, and the singles How to Rob and Ghetto Qua Ran. Columbia Records released him from the label after being shot on May 24th, 2000.

Around this time, Eminem had heard one of 50 Cent’s demo tapes and expressed a huge interest in him on MTV, as did Dr. Dre. Shortly after this, 50 Cent officially signed to Interscope Records. He was the first rapper to sign to the joint label owned by Dr. Dre and Eminem. The first song he released on this record was entitled Wanksta and was featured on the 8 Mile soundtrack.

In its first week of release, his debut ”Get Rich Or Die Tryin’” sold 872,000 units - easily reaching Gold status. Within the second week it went Platinum (1 mil) and on April 12th, 2004 the RIAA certified it six times Platinum.

In 2005 he followed the success of his album Get Rich or Die Tryin’ with a new release - The Massacre (originally called St. Valentines Day Massacre until the release date was pushed back). The first single released off this, Disco Inferno, was a huge hit - he followed this hit up by the release of Candy Shop and then again with Just a Lil Bit.

In 2003 Interscope Records allowed 50 Cent to have his own label - G-Unit Records. He first signed Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck as the established members of G-Unit Records. In 2004, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent had signed The Game under a joint venture. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/50+Cent"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

172,dj khaled,2501506,49368108,"Khaled Mohammed Khaled (/ˈkælɪd/; born November 26, 1975),[3] known professionally as DJ Khaled, is an American DJ, record producer, and record executive. Originally a Miami-based radio personality, Khaled has since become known for enlisting high-profile music industry artists to perform on singles and albums, for which he often serves as hype man. His distinctions are his booming voice presence, ""motivational"" abstractions, and numerous catchphrases. While his musical contribution is often questioned, Khaled's role has been described as ""organization, direction, [and] promotion"".[4][5]

Khaled was born in New Orleans to Palestinian immigrant parents. He first gained recognition as a radio host in the 1990s for the radio station 99 Jamz, and translated his popularity by working with Fat Joe's hip hop collective, Terror Squad, as a DJ for their live performances. Following his production credits on the group's material,[6] Khaled enlisted several hip hop artists associated with the group and his native Miami to perform on his debut studio album, Listennn... the Album (2006). His second album, We the Best (2007), spawned the hit single ""I'm So Hood"" (featuring T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross and Plies). His two subsequent releases—We Global (2008) and Victory (2010)—both peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200; the latter was supported by the single ""All I Do Is Win"" (featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross), which received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

His fifth studio album and major label debut, We the Best Forever (2011), saw continued commercial success and brought Khaled to mainstream prominence by spawning his first Billboard Hot 100-top ten single, ""I'm on One"" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross and Lil Wayne). His following three albums—Kiss the Ring (2012), Suffering from Success (2013), and I Changed a Lot (2015)—were released to moderate critical and commercial reception.[7] Throughout 2015 and 2016, Khaled gained wider recognition as a public figure due to his social media activity. This, along with several Internet memes, foresaw the release of his ninth studio album, Major Key (2016), which was met with further critical and commercial success as it debuted atop the Billboard 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.

His tenth album, Grateful (2017), became his second consecutive number-one album and was preceded by the singles ""I'm the One"" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) and ""Wild Thoughts"" (featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller), which peaked at numbers one and two on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. His eleventh album, Father of Asahd (2019), contained the song ""Higher"" (featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend), which won Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards—Khaled's first Grammy Award win. His eponymous twelfth album (2021) and thirteenth album, God Did (2022), both debuted atop the Billboard 200. The latter's title track (featuring Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend and Fridayy) earned three nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance.

Outside of music, Khaled has gained success as a writer, with his book The Keys featuring on the New York Times Best Seller list. He has also performed as an actor for the films Spies in Disguise (2019) and Bad Boys for Life (2020). His record label, We the Best Music Group has distributed his releases since its formation in 2008, though Khaled signed other artists to the imprint including Ace Hood, Kent Jones, Mavado, Flipp Dinero, and Vado, among others. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Khaled"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

178,lil peep,1712489,262231901,"Lil Peep (born Gustav Åhr) was an American recording artist hailing from Long Island, New York. He was cited as one of the primary artists responsible for the post-emo revival with his style of hip hop which came to be known as emo trap. After a slight delay, his debut album Come over When You're Sober, Pt. 1 was released on August 15, 2017. Due to a possible drug overdose, he passed away on November 15, 2017 (aged 21).

Lil Peep was described as a ""SoundCloud rapper"", and his musical style is considered lo-fi rap or emo-trap. The New York Times defined Åhr as the Kurt Cobain of lo-fi rap and described his music as gloomy and diabolically melodic. Åhr's music generally draws on both southern US rap and the angsty introspection of the rock subgenre post-hardcore.

In 2015, Åhr released his first mixtape, Lil Peep Part One, which generated 4,000 plays in its first week. Shortly thereafter, he released his first extended play, Feelz, and another mixtape, Live Forever.

182,freddie gibbs,1053086,77669101,"Freddie Tipton (born June 14, 1982 in Gary, Indiana), better known as Freddie Gibbs, is an American rapper who became popular after being included in XXL Magazine's ten Freshmen of 2010. He was previously signed to Interscope Records before being let go from his deal without an official record being released. He has released five mixtapes since his first in 2005 including Live From Gary, Indiana, Big Bizness, The Miseducation of Freddie Gibbs, midwestgangstaboxframecadillacmuzik and Str8 Killa No Filla. The Str8 Killa EP was released 3rd August. His debut LP Baby-Faced Killa and The Devil's Palace, a collaborative project with The Alchemist, were both released in 2012. He then would go on to release Cold Day in Hell in 2012, and ESGN in 2013. In 2014, Gibbs released Pinata, a collaborative album with producer Madlib, and The Tonite Show, another collaborative album with The World's Freshest. Gibbs newest album Shadow of a Doubt is planned to best released on November 20th via ESGN / EMPIRE.

Hailing from Gary, Indiana, a place whose murder and crime rates have ranked it several times at the top of the ""Most Dangerous Cities"" list, Freddie Gibbs is the true definition of a street survivor. Raised on Gary's east side, Gibbs lived the hard life firsthand in a run-down industrial community plagued with vice and ignored by the establishment. After playing at Ball State on a football scholarship, Gibbs was kicked out of college. Over the next few years he went through court-ordered boot camp, joined and got discharged from the military, and held down a series of 9 to 5 jobs without success. Feeling like the system had failed him, Gibbs turned to hustling; pimping and selling crack out of a local house. Inspired by rappers like UGK, The Geto Boys, and 2Pac, Gibbs started rhyming about his life and the issues facing urban youth in Gary and the countless other impoverished cities just like it.  Gibbs is the first rapper signed to a major label from Gary.

The Steel City's most famous musical residents to date are the Jackson 5, whose name still adorns a marquee on a falling-apart theater in Gary's blighted downtown. His desire to rep the Midwest and his city led Gibbs to start recording mixtapes and pushing them online as well as the streets, where he quickly began garnering fans drawn to his original style, diverse flows, and deeply personal lyrics about his experience as a young black man growing up below the poverty line in a forgotten American city. 

Freddie has worked with respected producers like Madlib, Red Spyda, Just Blaze, Buckwild, the Alchemist, Polow Da Don, and Collipark among many others. Gibbs cites Houston rap and Pac as his major influences, and it shows in his ability to alternate between chillingly tense street stories of violence and laid back comedic tales about women and weed. Ultimately Gibbs shows and proves with his rhymes, which demonstrate the promise of a legend in the making. His skills, wit, and street credibility establish Freddie Gibbs as a true artist. He's ready to represent for Gary, the Midwest, and anyone who relates to the struggle of inner city life. As Gibbs tells it: ""My music is definitely on some gangsta shit. That's what I was raised on and what I witnessed. How can I speak on anything else?""

197,lil darkie,552954,41071490,"Joshua Hamilton also known as his stage name ""Lil Darkie'' is a rapper, producer, and artist from Long Beach, California. 

He formally went as ""Brahman"" with a blue character, as he believed the Indian god Kali Ma was blue, after realizing that Kali Ma is portrayed with black skin, he rebranded as Lil Darkie and changed his sound alongside with the new persona. The Brahman period lasted a significant amount of time and even had a Collective before the Collective he has as Darkie named ""Spider Gang"", the Brahman collective was named ""Native Cruiser Records"" or NCR for short, and consisted of early Brahman collaborators and Brahman himself.

Lil Darkie’s music is most noticeable due to his “cartoonish” personality both in his music and on social media. He grew a heavy following online through the app TikTok, with songs such as ""Haha"" and ""Genocide"" being very popular. 

Darkie himself admits that the songs that got him popular are not songs he would make today and is no longer something that fully defines Lil Darkie as a character. With the album release ""The Future Is Dark"", Darkie showed his experimental sound alongside common rap niches.

Though Lil Darkie is very misunderstood with his music; especially with Genocide and Holocaust, the messages within his songs are more hidden and complex to the people who want to assume and hate on him for thinking he is racist and wrongfully using the N-word. Even though the use of the N-word is pretty controversial, on the other hand, him being racist or homophobic, etc. isn't the case whereas in multiple songs or occasions in real life, he is open with his sexuality and his opinions on thinking everyone is equal while using the slur due to not thinking one race can claim the word when everyone shouldn't be divided based on preferences and his argument that is promoted is to only spread positivity even with the outrageous titles that people catch their view on.

198,darkoo,97096,916913,"London-raised Nigeria born singer/songwriter Darkoo’s musical journey began at 15 after discovering her ability to rap. She began to merge the influences of being in the UK with the sound of her favourite African artists like WizKid and Maleek Berry, leading her to release her debut single ‘Gas Station’ at the tender age of 16. It was then that Darkoo knew exactly who and where she wanted to be.
 
Continuing to hone her craft, she exploded onto the scene late 2019 with the anthemic track ‘Gangsta' featuring One Acen, which saw her land her first UK Top 40 hit, peaking at #22. This was quickly followed by singles ‘Juicy’ and ‘Kryptonite’ which created a huge impact on the music scene.
 
Darkoo is the genre-blurring artist who has successfully created a sound that is distinctly her own, blending her international influences to create her own style of Afroswing, highlighting her vibrant and androgynous vocals perfectly.
 
As one of the most talked about artists in the UK right now British Vogue described Darkoo as “..The musician smashing stereotypes with her style and sound.” Her style is something that never goes amiss, often flipping her look from her blonde buzz cut and low slung trousers to flowing hair and slick dresses. Darkoo is definitely one to watch as she cements her way to becoming a true superstar. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/DARKoO"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

199,yo gotti,1099416,9151529,"Mario Mims (born May 19, 1981 in Memphis, Tennessee), better known by his stage name Yo Gotti, is an American rapper signed to Cash Money Records. Formerly known as Lil Yo in the 90's, he released his first album, From Da Dope Game 2 Da Rap Game, in 2000. Since then he has released 2001's Self-Explanatory, 2003's Life, 2006's Back 2 Da Basics, 2008's Cocaine Muzik, 2009's CM2 (Cocaine Muzik 2 hosted by DJ Drama), and The Pyrex King: Street Runnaz Special Edition.

As one of the six epicenters of Southern hip hop, Memphis has always had a thriving underground capable of producing major platinum superstars such as Eightball & MJG, 3-6 Mafia and Project Pat,Skip a.k.a Gianni Booker. All of the above-mentioned artists at one point in time literally dominated the city’s underground rap scene before going on to become national superstars. Next up to bat is Yo Gotti, M-Town’s current underground rap kingpin. Like his namesake John Gotti, the Memphis based rapper has been running the Southern underground scene with an iron fist for the past. Known and respected throughout the South for his skill and finesse on the microphone, Yo Gotti is one the South’s most respected young rappers.
Born Mario Mims, Yo Gotti grew up in the infamous Ridge Crest Apartments in a North Memphis neighborhood called Frazier. His childhood was typical for a poor ghetto youth in the Deep South. Raised in a family of hustlers and exposed to hard times 24 hours a day the Tennessee rap titan soon turned to the only thing that he knew could get him paid, hustling. “Being from the hood things like hustling will come your way,” says Yo Gotti. “Everybody in my family hustled in some kinda way.” Ironically, hustling is what ultimately led Yo Gotti to rapping.
Taking his cue from Memphis rap legends such as Eightball & MJG, Al Kapone, Gangsta Black, Triple 6 Mafia and Kingpin Skinny Pimp, all of whom he lists as influences, Yo Gotti released his own underground tape entitled, Youngster on the Come Up and placed it on consignment at local mom & pop record stores as well as hustling it out the trunk. The tape sold like hotcakes on the street and made Yo Gotti the hottest rapper on the streets of Memphis. From the Dope Game to the Rap Game, Yo Gotti’s sophomore effort sold so well that Select-O-Hits, a local based independent distributor offered him a small deal and the Memphis rapper more than doubled his fan base with absolutely no marketing or promotions. Soon he found himself ranked among the city’s top rappers. In addition to being featured on the cover of Murderdog Magazine along side his idols Kingpin Skinny Pimp and Al Kapone his record From the Dope Game to the Rap Game made the list for the magazine’s top independent record for the year 2000.
Two years later he inked a distribution deal with TVT Records and released the critically acclaimed album Life, which did respectable numbers for an independent label. “It sold about 40 or 50,000, with no promotions or video,” says Yo Gotti. “That record did what it did on its own.” But as the old saying goes when one door is closed another opened. Gotti’s reputation as the king of Memphis continued to spread and that eventually led him to a production deal with Cash Money/Universal records for his group the Block Burnaz. With his TVT sophomore album entitled Back 2 Da Basics, Yo Gotti returns with the same hardcore street flavor that his die-hard fans have come to know and love, only this time around the true king of Memphis has elevated his game a bit. Given the fact that his last record didn’t do the type of big number he’d hope for you’d think that Yo Gotti would switch up his style to reach a larger audience. Right? Wrong! According to Gotti his street credibility with his underground fans means more to him than gold or platinum status.
“The one thing that you have to understand is that when you create a fan base off of street product the last thing you wanna do is disrespect them by changing because of the record companies and stuff like that. When you do that you change what created you. To me it is very important that I keep in tune with the people that helped to sell 40,000 records independently. That’s why I call my record Back 2 Da Basics.”
Produced by DJ Thoomp, Mannie Fresh, Carlos Brody and newcomers Street Tunes, Back 2 Da Basics offers fans a gritty, insider’s view into the real streets of Memphis as seen through the eyes of Yo Gotti. Nowhere is this viewpoint more intense than on “Full Time,” the amped up lead single –and featured in the MTV Films’ Hustle & Flow movie - with a thunderous bass and intoxicating beat that espouses Gotti’s formula to success –hustle full time.
“A lotta cats wanna be a rapper or a street hustler but they don’t wanna put in the time that it takes,” says Yo Gotti. “They want the money and the cars and the girls, but they don’t wanna work hard for it. But to be successful at anything you gotta grind for it.” On the song “Mama We Gone Be Alright,” he waxes introspective by reflecting on all of the hard times that he and his family have suffered through the years and offers her hope-filled words encouragement. “Mama We Gone Be Alright” along with the gripping tune “My Story” emerges as two of the most interesting songs on Back 2 Da Basics. These three titles along with club banging songs like “Shorty” featuring Baby make Back 2 Da Basics one of the best albums of the year. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Yo+Gotti"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

200,rod wave,529600,35288078,"Rodarius Marcell Green (born August 27, 1998), known professionally as Rod Wave, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter.

Green rose to fame with the 2019 single ""Heart on Ice"", which went viral on YouTube and TikTok and peaked at number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. Green's debut album, Ghetto Gospel (2019), peaked at number 10 on the US Billboard 200. His second album, Pray 4 Love (2020), peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, and included his highest-charting song, ""Rags2Riches.""

Green was born on August 27, 1999, and raised in St. Petersburg, Florida. He was raised by his mother and father, who eventually separated while he attended elementary school. He began singing in the fifth grade. Green attended Lakewood High School, from which he graduated in 2017.

Green's career began in 2018. He released several mixtapes independently prior to signing with Alamo Records. On June 14, 2019, he released his mixtape PTSD, which included the song ""Heart On Ice"". The song went viral on YouTube and TikTok, peaking at number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. Green's debut album, Ghetto Gospel was released on November 1, 2019, and peaked at number 10 on the US Billboard 200.

Green's second album Pray 4 Love was released on April 3, 2020, debuting at number 2 on the Billboard 200, with a deluxe edition following on August 7.

Blessed with a special singing voice, and the knowledge of how best to use it, Florida's Rod Wave is taking his own path to the top of the game. Coming through with a soulful set of Southern sing-raps, Rod has developed a groundswell of regional support through a prolific output that includes 3 projects in the last 12 months. After generating millions of streams with breakout singles “Heart On Ice” and “Popular Loner,” both off June 2019’s PTSD project, Rod levels up with Ghetto Gospel, his new project. With heavy use of organic instrumentation, including snaking electric guitars and warm organ swells, Ghetto Gospel gives a proper title to Rod's spiritual and nakedly-emotional blend of rap music, defined by Rod's unique singing ability, able to switch from a bluesy croon to rapid-fire triplets at a moments notice. Featuring the popular new single ""Cuban Links,"" which features an appearance from Ghetto Gospel executive producer Kevin Gates, and the ""Heart On Ice"" (Remix), which features an appearance from Lil Durk, Ghetto Gospel is available everywhere.

Recently Rod Wave was arrested and his height was exposed (5'6 and weighing 350lbs/160kg). This means he has a BMI of 58 and puts him in the morbidly obese section of the BMI scale. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Rod+Wave"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
