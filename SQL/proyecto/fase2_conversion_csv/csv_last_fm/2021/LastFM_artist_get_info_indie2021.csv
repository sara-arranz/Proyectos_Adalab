The sudden viral success of ""Freaks,"" a song they'd released years earlier, earned them a deal with Atlantic, which issued the band's fourth album, Magic Hour, in 2022.

In autumn 2021, their fifth studio album, Hogar, was released independently, under the Hook Ediciones Musicales label and distributed by Altafonte. Hogar, an album of ten everyday stories told through photography, storytelling, video and song. Produced by IZAL, Brett Shaw (Foals, Florence and The Machine, Lady Gaga, etc.) and Sancho Gómez-Escolar, who dedicated the last months of 2020 to building ten new musical homes straddling the landscapes of the Tramontana mountains in Mallorca , the frenzy of the Madrid asphalt and the stubborn London rain. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Izal"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Joselito Maravilla (accordion) and Maravilloso David (main vocals, guitar) met over there.

After some months playing on the streets, they decided to come back to Spain and start up a band mixing traditional music (Irish, American and Slavic), rock&roll structures and the most classic blues. To accomplish such an achivement, they recruited the two most particular musicians they found: inimitable Juan Mariscal (bass) and matchless Adán R&R Maravilla (guitar).

Once the band is setup, La Maravillosa Orquesta shut themselves away in their garage to carry out frenzied rehearsal sessions. Finally, they got a handful of songs. To back them up alive, la M.O.D.A. turns to well-known saxophonist Álvar de Maravilla, fiddler Bea Ruiz and drummer Maraviglioso Caleb.

She is known for her blend of indie pop, dream pop, and electronic music. She grew up in a creatively and musically supportive environment; her mother, Kärsti Stiege, was a photographer and former member of the band Tant Strul, while her father, Johan Zachrisson, was a musician in the Swedish reggae/progg band Dag Vag. Her brother, Zacharias Zachrisson, also pursued a music career. The family moved frequently, living in Stockholm, Portugal, Nepal, and India, which exposed her to a variety of cultural and musical influences from a young age. These experiences would later inform her music style and creative outlook.

At 19, Lykke Li spent several months in Brooklyn, New York, immersing herself in the local music scene before returning to Sweden. She went back to Brooklyn two years later at age 21 to record her debut album, Youth Novels, which was released in Sweden on January 30, 2008. Produced by Björn Yttling of the band Peter Bjorn and John along with Lasse Mårtén, Youth Novels gained international acclaim for its confessional lyrics and minimalistic production. It was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland in June 2008 and in the United States on August 19. Her single ""Little Bit"" from the album captured widespread attention, gaining praise from the indie community and the music site Stereogum, which described her style as a blend of soul, electro, and “powdered-sugar pop.”

Building on the success of her debut, Lykke Li continued to release music that explored themes of love, heartache, and introspection. Her follow-up albums, Wounded Rhymes in 2011 and I Never Learn in 2014, showcased a more mature, emotionally charged sound, with Wounded Rhymes earning her two Swedish Grammy Awards for Artist of the Year and Album of the Year in 2012. Alongside her solo career, she collaborated with prominent artists like Kleerup and Röyksopp, lending her vocals to the tracks ""Until We Bleed,"" ""Miss It So Much,"" and ""Were You Ever Wanted."" Her growing popularity led to notable appearances on shows like Conan and Skavlan in early 2011, helping her reach an even broader audience.

In 2016, Lykke Li co-founded the band LIV alongside members of Miike Snow and Peter Bjorn and John, further expanding her creative pursuits. Two years later, she released her fourth album, So Sad So Sexy (2018), marking a shift towards a more mainstream pop sound infused with late-2010s production influences. Her 2022 album, Eyeye, saw her return to a more introspective and sonically experimental approach, once again showcasing her characteristic blend of melancholic lyrics and innovative production. Over her career, Lykke Li has built a reputation for her sensuous, ethereal vocals and innovative musical style, solidifying her place as a significant figure in contemporary indie pop and electronic music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lykke+Li"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The five person indie rock band is part of a science team investigating climate change and evolutional biology on the Antarctic Peninsula – a region where temperatures have risen by nearly 3°C during the last 50 years.

From April to October - the Antarctic winter - planes can’t fly in because of the cold – the frozen sea keeps ships out. Physically isolated from the rest of the world, the 22 wintering team share their talent and creativity with one another.

The group gained worldwide attention after being the sole act of the Antarctic concert for Live Earth on July 7, 2007. Several people - including Dave Holmes and Larry King - called their performance the best of the concerts.

In the beginning they were influenced by The Cure (they toured with them in Spain), Radiohead and R.E.M. Today they have the personal Love of Lesbian sound and style. There is always a ""sold out"" at all their concerts. Each one is a mix of party-concert-celebration-catharsis.
Santi Balmes, the writer, main composer, and charismatic leader brings to each album excellent lyrics of high composition, from a delicious sense of humour to deep emotional tales. Their first three albums are sung in English, but their more acclaimed album is Maniobras de Escapismo (2005), the first sung in Spanish. With ""Cuentos Chinos Para Niños Del Japón"" (2007) they confirm again the band in the scene.
In 2009 (March 24) , they publish ""1999 (o como generar incendios de nieve con una lupa enfocada a la luna)"" a concept album that tells, 10 years later, the life of a relationship between a boy and a girl during 1999 (the year of their first album). It includes songs to dance to, to listen to in intimacy or just to think about.
Videoclips are another face of the LOL experience;  the first video of ""1999..."" is ""Club de fans de John Boy""  and the second one is ""Te hiero mucho (Historia del amante guisante)"" both directed by the influent director Lyona, who also directed ""Universos Infinitos"" from ""Cuentos chinos para niños del Japón"".

24,la roux,1981890,41032414,"There are multiple bands called La Roux/Laroux:

1: La Roux is the electropop project of Elly Jackson (born 12 March 1988 in London, United Kingdom; singer and keyboardist). It started as a duo in 2008 and became a solo project in 2011, when Jackson's songwriting and producing partner Ben Langmaid left the group. Her music is largely influenced by 80s pop music including Eurythmics, Depeche Mode, The Human League,  Heaven 17, Yazoo and Prince.

The name La Roux (pronounced lah-roo) is reported to be chosen when Elly found it in a book of baby names. La Roux comes from the mix of the French masculine word for ""redhead"" and the feminine article for ""the"", referring to Jackson's distinctive hairstyle.

In 2006 Jackson and Langmaid were introduced by a mutual friend. Their first project was named Automan and they wrote largely acoustic music.

In 15 December 2008, La Roux released their first single ""Quicksand"" on Kitsuné Music label, reaching just #129 on UK. This single was followed on 29 June 2009 by their debut album La Roux on Polydor label. The album peaked at #2 on UK albums chart, #158 on US charts, and it sold over 500,000 copies worldwide.

La Roux' second single ""In For the Kill"" was released on 16 March 2009. This single debuted at #11 on the UK singles chart and peaked at #2. The dubstep producer Skream made two remixes of this track: ""In for the Kill (Skream's Let's Get Ravey remix)"" and ""In for the Kill (That Doesn't Sound Like Skream's remix)"". Lifelike also made a remix entitled ""In for the Kill (Lifelike Remix)"".

""Bulletproof"" was released on 22 June 2009 and debuted at #1 on the UK singles chart and peaked at #8 on the US charts. This single was ranked #25 on Rolling Stone's list of The 25 Best Songs of 2009. They issued ""I'm Not Your Toy"" as fourth single on 27 September 2009, reaching #27 on the UK singles chart.

La Roux gained fifth position on the BBC's Sound of 2009 poll. The Guardian featured La Roux as one of the ""Best New Acts of 2009"" in the January of that year. The debut album has been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Also they have received 2010 BRIT Award nominations in the categories of British Breakthrough Act and British Single for ""In for the Kill"".

They won the NME Award for Best Dancefloor Filler with ""In For The Kill (Skream's Let's Get Ravey remix)"". They were also the only band to be featured 4 times on the NME 50 Best Tracks of 2009 list with ""I'm Not Your Toy"" placed at #41, ""Bulletproof"" at #24, ""In For the Kill (Skream's Let's Get Ravey remix)"" at #19 and ""In For The Kill"" at #8.

In 2014 La Roux released a second album, ""Trouble in Paradise"".

26,cala vento,18912,747692,"Sometimes, a band’s story can be extraordinarily simple. Cala Vento was chosen for an apprenticeship stage for young bands. Music professionals were selected to share their knowledge and experiences with them as to improve their outreach. One of these pros, Eric Fuentes, was deeply impressed by their talent and offered to produce the band’s debut album. Now the album is a reality and has reached BCore, who together with Hang The Dj Records, has decided to get the project as far out there as they possibly can.

Meanwhile, Aleix and Joan, two friends from Figueres and Torroella that share a passion for duos that use a guitar and drums as the minimum unit a rock band can use, and who both confess to having listened to BCore’s catalogue quite a few times, quickly turn into one of the most intense live acts in the Spanish underground movement. Their songs, true as few others, with brilliant lyrics and an outstanding dramatic pulse, captures the listener’s attention from the first moment, with quality details in every corner (the excellent work on the lower frequencies makes sure you don’t miss the bass), overflowing sensibility and that youthful energy that makes rock music such a special and necessary genre. Comparable to Japandroids or L’Hereu Escampa for their formation, or even to the speedy side of Los Planetas or the more melodic Nueva Vulcano, they have definitely found that magic formula that makes a band interesting album wise, with their ingenious lyrics, rich details and capacity to express, as live, with their solidness and spontaneity, already proved thanks to their recent concerts at Primavera Club and SXSW festival in Austin, TX <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Cala+Vento"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Carrera

Wos arrancó desde muy pequeño rapeando en las plazas y participando en competencias como El Quinto Escalón, donde ya demostraba un gran potencial y sobre todo mucho coraje. Pero fue en 2016 cuando demostró que su nivel estaba para mucho más que una plaza, ganando así varias fechas del Quinto Escalón, tirando acotes memorables, que se viralizaron mucho en las redes sociales y salió campeón de la fecha final, dejando en el camino a Dtoke en la primera ronda y derrotando en la final a Klan. Wos es uno de los que más veces logró ganar la competencia de El Quinto Escalón.

En el 2017 participó en la Final Nacional Red Bull Batalla de los Gallos por primera vez, donde salió campeón derrotando, entre otros, a Papo, uno de los candidatos en los Cuartos de final y a Klan en la final y así se clasificó a la Internacional que se llevó a cabo en México en la cual quedó segundo detrás de Aczino.

También participó en otras competencias como la Double AA que ganaría en Argentina. En la Red Bull Batalla de los Gallos Internacional 2018 se coronó campeón. En FMS Argentina 2018 Wos también salió victorioso después de ganarle en la final a Papo. También tuvo un papel protagonista en la película Las Vegas dirigida por Juan Villegas.

Actualmente en 2019 anunció su retiro de la FMS para desviar su atención a su carrera musical, sin embargo seguirá activo en otras competencias, como por ejemplo GodLevel, en la cual represento a Argentina junto a Papo y Trueno en la que quedaron subcampeones, y la final internacional de Red Bull 2019.

The group's name comes from joining Barry White's name with the song ""Brava"", by Italian singer Mina Mazzini.

In 2009 their self-produced demo Ídolo was released. Composed of ten songs, in which they show a clear influence of the Spanish pop of the 1980s, such as Nacha Pop and Radio Futura, spiced with disco music and reminiscences of new romantic. With this first album, they toured the Spanish geography and participated in festivals such as Sonorama, Ebrovisión, Electromar, SOS 4.8, Arenal Sound, Con V de Valarés, Lemon Pop, Indielx, B-Side, and Low Cost.

42,leisure,409064,5301791,"There are five artists with the name Leisure:

1) LEISURE is a band from New Zealand that launched on SoundCloud in 2015 with 'Got It Bad.'  https://soundcloud.com/theleisurecollective

Made up of five independently talented and successful members who were looking for a new creative outlet unconstrained by over-thinking, over-planning, and excessive control; LEISURE are an anomaly in the music industry. This unusual melting-pot of contributions means LEISURE is greater than the sum of its parts, each member bringing different influences from 70s funk, to 90s rap and R&B, all the way to dance music from the early 2000s. Each member also brings a different skill set – strong pop song writing sensibilities, experimental production techniques, and the talent to mix and master their own work.

Having amassed over 60 million streams on their debut album, which entered at #2 in the NZ charts, they have built a rabid fan following that has seen their very occasional live shows sell out and become the stuff of legends – recently performing their debut, backed by the 72-piece Auckland Philharmonic Orchestra, to a sold-out Auckland Town Hall.

Their music has become a staple in the sync world, they have collaborated with hip-hop star, Goldlink, and have now signed globally to US / UK record label Nettwerk for their forthcoming album.

Their self-titled debut album release was critically acclaimed and with their sophomore album complete, fans worldwide continue to connect with their manifesto of living the good life, and their over-riding code to “keep things LEISURE”.

2) Leisure is a band from Boston, MA consisting of Jed Rouhana, Sam Hamad, and Chris Link. The three members played in bands together since High School. In 2010, they gave a demo CD to JR White of the San Francisco band Girls, during one of Girls' Boston shows. The CD included ""It's Alright (On The Suez Canal)"". White subsequently invited Leisure to open on their US tour. After touring, Leisure began work on their debut album ""Plastic Soul"", which they self-produced. The album is set to be released in 2012. More information can be found on their official website,www.leisureofficial.com and facebook page, www.facebook.com/leisuremusic

3) Leisure featured Middle Class Rut hitmakers Zack Lopez and Sean Stockham and a rotating cast of singers. The earliest incarnation of the band, which included D. Scott Sault, who would later front the short-lived Atlantic Records act Quitter, self-released an EP, Polygraph Alliance, in 1999. After Sault's departure the band briefly included Die Trying (Island) frontman Jassen Jensen. The band eventually landed a deal with Dreamworks, then fronted by Darren, and, shortly thereafter, at least briefly, ex-Hotwire frontman Rus Martin stepped in. The band's one and only national tour was opening for CKY. No word on if an album was ever completed, though several demos, some more impressive (""Deathtrap"") than others, do exist. 

4) Leisure was formed 1998 in New York City. They play non-Britpop and sing about faith, hope and love. Drew sings/play guitar, Peter plays keys/sings, Steve plays bass and Ted plays guitar/sings. They had recorded 2 EP’s (Occasional Music 1.0 & 2.0) with SoundOptik (Ryan Adams, The Strokes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion), Jesse Sprinkle (Poor Old Lu, Serene UK, Starflyer 59) and Andrew D. Prickett (The Violet Burning, Cush, The Prayer Chain). Their music can be heard on XM Satellite Radio.

5) Leisure is still a young band but has some experience however. Formed in November 2004 with the idea of playing only covers. In view of the result of exalting rehearsals, the band decided quickly, under the impulse of Francois, the bands songwriter, to create a set entirely made of their own compositions. The band chose clearly its style, under the British influence and sensitive to each decade (from The Beatles, the Kinks to The Libertines as well as Oasis). Leisure is made up of five members : a drummer with a heavy strike (Nessim, 23), a bassist who gives a certain feminine touch to the band (Coralie, 19), a rhythmical thorough guitarist (Nicolas, 22), a soloist gifted guitarist (Francois, 21) and a charismatic singer (Siamack, 20). The year 2005 has meant toil for the band, accumulating compositions and hours of intensive rehearsals. The band performed at that time in the main venues of Bordeaux, like lInca, lAssonette, la Centrale and some open air gigs like the participation to the festival « Tête de lArt ». At the end of the year, Leisure recorded his first demo called « Shoots in the Streets », recorded and mixed by Kim, produced by the band itself and containing five of their songs played live. The year 2006 is promising for the band which had the honor to play in renowned places such as lHeretic et le SonArt, still improving their set on stage and their compositions. They were also broadcasted several times on radios, like Radio Sauvagine (94.9 FM). After having had the ambition to be known in Bordeaux, the band thinks of exporting itself little by little in whole France. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Leisure"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1.  Jungle is an English modern soul musical collective founded by childhood friends, Tom McFarland and Josh Lloyd-Watson.

Throughout the following year Jungle developed its nature as a collective by working with different artists across diverse disciplines. To perform the music live, Jungle expanded to a seven-piece band, fronted by J and T. Their debut album Jungle was released through XL Recordings on 14 July 2014.  The album was met with great critical acclaim and was later shortlisted for the 2014 Mercury Prize. Their 2nd album, For Ever, was released on 14 September 2018.

He lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan where he composes, records, teaches and performs with Jungle has his own band Dave Sharp's Secret Seven.



3.Nothing is known about this excellent late sixties album's makers. A reissue is now available, so you can hear how good it is for yourself! Early Morning Rising, Slave Ship, House Of Rooms and Gray Picnic are all loaded with nice guitar and organ, even frantic (if somewhat inept) drumming on occasion. The tracks have an atmospheric, open quality and the recording is superb. This is a lost gem. The reissue has a deluxe embossed cover. It was originally issued in a plain sleeve.

60,del water gap,524298,13411285,"Del Water Gap is the solo project of American songwriter, producer, and singer Samuel Holden Jaffe. Born in New Haven, Connecticut, Jaffe currently resides in Brooklyn, New York. His music is known for its intimate nature, drawing inspiration from ""romantic encounters and dimly lit rooms.""

Jaffe's musical journey began while attending boarding school in Millbrook, New York. It was during this time that he adopted the name Del Water Gap, inspired by the sight of it handwritten on the back of a box truck. Initially, Jaffe played drums in a noise rock band, where he had limited opportunities to showcase his vocals. Seeking further education in music and sound production, he pursued studies at the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at NYU.

While Del Water Gap was originally a band, it eventually transitioned into Jaffe's solo project. The lineup underwent changes during his college years, including a collaboration with singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers, who was involved for a six-month period. Jaffe and Rogers initially connected during their freshman year of college, and they released the song ""New Song,"" recorded in 2014. Collaborations have played a significant role in Jaffe's career, as he also worked with Claud on the single ""My Body"" and co-wrote and produced Claud's ""Never Meant To Call.""

In 2018, Jaffe signed with Terrible Records and released the single ""Laid Down My Arms."" This was followed by the release of the singles ""Chastain"" and ""Theory of Emotion"" as a lead-up to his third EP, ""Don't Get Dark,"" also under Terrible Records.

Del Water Gap signed with Atlantic Records in 2020, and subsequently released the tracks ""Ode to a Conversation Stuck in Your Throat"" and ""Mariposa."" The song ""Ode to a Conversation Stuck in Your Throat"" gained significant attention when actresses Margaret Qualley and Kaitlyn Dever shared an Instagram video of themselves participating in a ""socially distant dance party"" to the song during the initial summer of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2021, Del Water Gap joined Mom + Pop Music, releasing the single ""Hurting Kind"" along with a music video co-directed by Charlie Plummer. The video received support from MTV, and images from the shoot were featured in GQ. Del Water Gap's debut album was released with Mom + Pop Music in October 2021, followed by a headline tour and a support tour alongside Jeremy Zucker. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Del+Water+Gap"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

66,lord huron,1848873,50949208,"Lord Huron are an American alternative rock band founded by Ben Schneider, a Michigan-born visual arts major. 

Origins:
In the spring of 2010 Schneider traveled from Los Angeles to Northern Michigan. At Lake Huron, he developed songs for the first Lord Huron EP. He named the recording, Into the Sun. Upon his return to L.A., Schneider set to work putting a band together. The first to join him was his percussion-playing childhood friend Mark. Each of the band members of band hail from Michigan.

Into The Sun and Mighty
Lord Huron released two EPs in 2010, Into the Sun and Mighty. Pop & Hiss, the LA Times Music Blog, described Mighty as ""full of lush acoustic guitars and Midwestern-accented harmonies as warm as a winter fireplace, but it's the Caribbean-influenced percussion that fans Lord Huron's folk sound into flame,""and Pitchfork could only classify it as ""a stylistic superball, bouncing off any wall you put around it."" NPR's World Cafe wrote ""the band's lush harmonies are backed by a hazy whirlpool of polyrhythmic tropical drums and folk guitars.""
Despite the fact that Schneider played all of the instruments on both EPs, he has gathered a band for live performances, which have also gotten positive reviews. ""The totality of the experience was like being on hand for a combination drum circle, chamber performance, and Calypso street party,"" wrote LA Weekly.Some of the larger shows the band has performed at include Lollapalooza (2011) and Outside Lands (2011), as well as a marathon ten shows in four days at the SXSW (2011) music festival.

71,myd,326444,2866023,"
As a graduate in sound engineering at prestigious Parisian FEMIS film school, Quentin Lepoutre, aka Myd, offered his strong technical expertise to make his Club Cheval crew – him plus Canblaster, Panteros666 and Sam Tiba – become serious outsiders on the dance music map. A strawberry-blond version of Quincy Jones for the Facebook/Tumblr/post-empire generation, Myd’s a very versatile music-maker, both able to deliver purely functional, club-oriented tracky material, and poppier, regressive house fantaisies. His audio skills give his work a unique 3D coating, a singular, artificial patina. The sound of Myd is something wide and hyperactive, though displaying the compacted, throbbing textures that define the trademark Club Cheval sound.

Myd’s long-term ambition would be to build new standards for mainstream dance music. Traffic between underground scenes and mass-produced hits having never been so saturated, listeners need artists to act as musical scouts, to filter, sort out, and recompose this data overload, and instinctively conjuring its secret pathways and logic. And that’s pretty much what Myd’s here for. He aspires to become a proper pop producer, a true « music director », and can’t really be bothered with some niche-star status. Working with other artists always had him refine his own personal sound, and helped him use his production tools better and better. Myd’s sound lays on a rich, contrasted aural palette : it’s high-tech sounding, well-balanced, complex yet articulate. It blends Euro techno gusts with tropical siroccos, and an unmissable song-craft with a taste for baroque-ish sophistication.

Since his first track, « Train to Bamako », one the founding hits of the tropical house scene in 2009, Myd has produced many brilliant, smart remixes, for artists such as Yelle ou Two Door Cinema Club. Then last spring, he came back with the « Octodip » EP – that was less tropical and more focused on occult vocal cut-up work – for new French label Marble, created in early 2011 by former Institubes mainstays Para One, Surkin and Bobmo. As Club Cheval are currently working on their debut album, the future seems clear and vivid for our boy Myd, teeming with previously unheard musical ideas and aural stimuli. And meanwhile, go and check his productions, feel ecstatic, and just imagine what’s up next. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Myd"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

75,l'impératrice,533443,12258891,"L'Impératrice (French pronunciation: [lɛ̃peʁatʁis]; ""The Empress"") is a project that began in 2012, a French band with a myriad of dreams that have now become reality. However, the vision of each of them has not changed that much as they have become an international band and they claim to keep their feet very firmly on the ground, as, in their words, it is always a work in progress. Despite this, there are still achievements to unlock, one of which is playing at Madison Square Garden, one of their favourite venues.

The band was initially formed by keyboardist Charles de Boisseguin, who started the project solo until he met the other keyboardist, Hagni Gwon. Gwon later called in bassist David Gaugué and drummer Tom Daveau. Soon after, guitarist Achille Trocellier joined, and the group was officially formed in 2012. In 2015, french singer Flore Benguigui joined the group. After making 3 studio albums and spending 9 years with the band, Flore announced her departure from L'Impératrice in September 2024, citing ""profound personal, artistic, and fundamental disagreements"" between her and the band. Less than a month later, the band revealed their new vocalist Louve.

Their pop, funk and electronic sounds, Flore's sweet tone singing in French, coupled with a retro yet futuristic aesthetic, broke the language barrier and took them to stages they could never have imagined. After albums and EPs such as ""Sonate Pacifique"", ""Odyssée"", ""Vanille Fraise"" and ""Matahari"", their most recent album is 2024's ""Pulsar"", with songs in English and French, which included collaborations with artists such as Erick the Architect and Maggie Rogers.

L'Impératrice's retro pop and disco music places them as heirs to the French Touch trend pioneered by Daft Punk, to whom they have paid homage in their music videos, and represented by groups such as Air and Phoenix. But in their case, they pride themselves on being a band that doesn't rely so much on synthesizers, but plays their instruments entirely live.

They once received an email from a fan who congratulated them on their EP L'Odyssée but couldn't understand why on vinyl Flore Benguigui's voice sounded so different from the YouTube videos, almost sounding like a boy. The answer to the mystery: he had been playing the record at the wrong speed. This happy accident led the band to release a slowed-down version of the work. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/L%27Imp%C3%A9ratrice"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

81,marina,1722500,124452469,"There are several artists with this name: 

1) Marina Lambrini Diamandis, known mononymously as Marina and previously by the stage name Marina & the Diamonds, is a Welsh singer and songwriter.

Born in Brynmawr to a Welsh mother and Greek father, Diamandis was raised in Abergavenny and moved to London as a teenager to become a professional singer, despite having little formal musical experience. In 2009, she came to prominence upon placing second in the BBC's Sound of 2010. Her debut studio album, The Family Jewels (2010), incorporated indie pop and new wave musical styles. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number five and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. The album's second single, ""Hollywood"", peaked at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart. Her follow-up record, Electra Heart (2012), was a concept album about a character of the same name which became her first number one project in the United Kingdom. The album was certified gold in the US and UK, with its singles ""Primadonna"" and ""How to Be a Heartbreaker"" becoming international hits.

Diamandis' synthpop-inspired third studio album, Froot  (2015), became her third top 10 album in the UK and her first top 10 entry on the US Billboard 200, where it charted at number 8.

2) Marina Lima started her career in the 1980's using the stage name Marina. Since the 90's she has been using Marina Lima on all of her releases. Lima is a widely popular brazilian singer-songwriter.

Starting her career before brazilian rock of the '80s was commercially ripe, Marina Lima witnessed its creation from a privileged standpoint and participated in it as a successful pop star since 1984. Her most regular partner has been her brother, poet and philosopher Antônio Cícero. Her biggest hits are ""Fullgás"" (Marina/Antônio Cícero), ""À Francesa"" (Marina/Antônio Cícero), ""Pra Começar"" (Marina/Antônio Cícero), ""Nada Por Mim"" (Herbert Viana/Paula Toller), ""Eu Te Amo Você"" (Kiko Zambianchi), ""Ainda É Cedo,"" ""Não Sei Dançar,"" and ""Uma Noite e Meia."" Her eclectic repertory features rock-tinged pop-dance music, blues, bossa nova, a typical samba-canção melancholy, and a very tiny pinch of jazz.

From five to 12, she lived in the USA where her father worked, and was taught to read in English before Portuguese. Attracted to psychoanalysis and music, Marina Lima (just Marina by then; she added her surname to her stage name in the '90s) started to write songs, opting for making a living in this career when Gal Costa recorded her ""Meu Doce Amor"" in 1977. The next year she formed a band that had a drummer who would be connected with the creation and the development of the Brazilian rock of the '80s, Lobão. Ricardo Barreto (guitar), Guto Barros (guitar), Zé Luís (sax), and Junno Homrich (bass) would also participate in that historic moment (they later became musicians of the seminal Brazilian rock band Blitz) as they were also in her band before the new genre took Brazil. Marina's first solo album, Simples Como Fogo (1979), already brought originals in the pop/rock style that would become mainstream in the next decade. But her first hit came in 1984, with ""Fullgás,"" which had success with the title track ""Me Chama"" (Lobão) and ""Mesmo que Seja Eu"" (Roberto Carlos/Erasmo Carlos, here having its meaning altered as a confession of her bisexuality). Three years later, she appeared in the film Rádio Pirata (Lael Rodrigues) singing the main theme, which she also composed. With 15 albums released in Brazil as 2000, others were launched especially for the American market and dominated a period in which anxiety provoked a loss of voice; Marina Lima is one of the biggest divas of Brazilian rock.

3) Marina Luchenko-Szczesna (Polish: Marina Łuczenko-Szczęsna; Ukrainian: Марина Лученко–Ще́нсний; born 3 July 1989), known mononymously as Marina (stylized as MaRina), is a Ukrainian-Polish singer-songwriter and actress. 

4) Marina Vénache, known as Marina on stage, is a French singer born on October 30, 1985. She started her career in the sixth season of the TV show ""Star Academy"" in 2006. 

5) Marina Marqueza (currently using the name Marqueza) is a non-binary Japanese-Venezuelan artist, singer, and producer based in Salt Lake City, Utah making genre-fluid music from the bottom of their heart. They want to see the Salt Lake City art scene become more radically inclusive of the diversity of talent that already exists, and they put that intentionality behind every event they agree or refuse to be a part of. Marina loves Existimos, Patty and Graciela, and she wants to perform a set that is affirming and healing from their place as a queer person of color. Her debut album, Orbit Pluto, was released on January 1, 2019. 

6) Marina, a Czech metalcore band from Prague.

7) Marina Nakamura(中村 真里奈, Nakamura Marina, born February 7, 1987) is a Japanese singer and songwriter from Miyazaki who is signed to 5pb. Marina debuted in 2010 singing songs for the anime television series Angel Beats! as one of two vocalists for the fictional band Girls Dead Monster.

Esteban Mateus Williamson, better known as Esteman (born May 4, 1984) is a Colombian singer and songwriter.
Esteman has been developing his interest in music since the age of 12, as he attended several music and theatre academies, acting classes and college education in Electronic Media Arts. At a prodigiously young age Esteman started writing songs and school plays involving musical theatre for his elementary school and ever since, writing and performing has become one of his favorites activities. Later on, while he was in college, Esteman decided to pursue his music career full-time, he found in music a perfect space where he was able to focus in his main interest: music.
This is how Esteman's musical project begins, mixing styles and influences in order to build catchy melodies loaded with irony, where the plastic sounds of a synthesizer get together with percussion elements both usual and inusual, saxophones and old school guitars as we can hear in his first single ""No te metas a mi Facebook"" which translates ""Dont bother me on Facebook"".

With a careful fusion of elements where you can find eclectic pop, disco music, indie-pop, the most thought provoking lyrics and choreography, Esteman's project gets launched in the latin pop market with a musical, visual and performative proposal that will make you vibrate until the end of this song.

87,glass animals,2166336,105915363,"Glass Animals is an English electronic/indie rock band formed in Oxford in 2010. The band's line-up consists of Dave Bayley (vocals, guitar, keyboards, drums, songwriting), Drew MacFarlane (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Edmund Irwin-Singer (bass, keyboards, backing vocals), and Joe Seaward (drums).

All four members of the band met at St Edward's School in Oxford. Dave Bayley attended St Edward's on a music scholarship and was introduced to Drew MacFarlane, who would become the band's guitarist and backing vocalist; the two bonded over the fact that they were both Britons who had spent their childhoods in the U.S. MacFarlane then introduced Bayley to Edmund Irwin-Singer, the band's bassist, and Joe Seaward, its drummer. They began playing together as a group in 2010.

On 28 May 2012, the band released their debut EP Leaflings, which included the single ""Cocoa Hooves"". The EP was released on independent label Kaya Kaya Records, a subsidiary and imprint of XL Recordings (part of the Beggars Group of labels).

In 2014, the band made their first tour of the U.S. and performed at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. They released three more singles: ""Gooey"", ""Pools"", and ""Hazey"", along with a collaboration with Argentine singer-songwriter and producer Tei Shi.

Their second album, How to Be a Human Being (2016), won two MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self Producing Artist of the Year and was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize. The concept behind the album, in which each song tells a story inspired by fictional characters, allowed the band to explore various musical styles and themes, contributing to its widespread acclaim.

The band's third album, Dreamland (2020), marked a more introspective turn, as Bayley delved into personal themes, touching on nostalgia and memory. Dreamland reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and number seven on the US Billboard 200, driven in part by the massive success of “Heat Waves.” The song, which became a global hit through TikTok, eventually topped charts worldwide, including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and achieved over two billion Spotify streams by 2022. The album was promoted with singles like “Tokyo Drifting” featuring rapper Denzel Curry and “Your Love (Déjà Vu)”.

A stark deviation from Little Big League's guitar-based indie rock, it showcased Zauner's dark lyrics, unique vocals and inherent knack for pop melody.

The album explores Zauner's experimental interests and hosts a wide range of sound: jarring anime samples, minimalist ballads, rhythms and synths reminiscent of Tango in the Night-era Fleetwood Mac paired with the moody intimacy of Mount Eerie. Psychopomp revisits and revamps lo-fi tracks and adds chilling new songs to fall in love with. 

In 2019, Japanese Breakfast released two singles under the W Hotels music label, ""Essentially"" and a cover of the Tears for Fears song, Head Over Heels.

In 2021, Zauner returns, having released three singles to her upcoming album, Jubilee, which will be out on the 4th of June.

Their first residency, held on Tuesdays at The Evelyn Hotel in Fitzroy Melbourne was extended from 4 weeks to four months due to popular demand.

In 2000, Mathieu Hocine started his project ""Kid Francescoli"". He was soon joined by Laetitia Abello (vocals), David Borras (keyboards) and Olivier Scalia (bass). They played their first gigs in 2004.

Behind the omnipresent melody, Kid Francescoli offers intimate lyrics in English and Italian, many dealing with young men's angst and the dreams of a girl at the dawn of her thirtieth birthday. The music, with its tenacious refrains and its heartfelt instrumentals, shows the inspiration of Air and Grandaddy. At the same time, Italian acts like Cinecitta Ennio Morricone's sound tracks are an obvious influence for this group from Marseilles.

After showing promise as a live act, especially during the Marsatac 2005 festival, the group launched their first national tour (Paris, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Rennes, Nice) in May 2006, sharing the stage with artists such Sebastien Schuller or Troy Von Balthazar.

""Cape Elizabeth"" was then released on May 1, 2020.

On June 17, 2021 Kahan announced his second full-length album titled ""I Was/I Am"". Five days later he announced the ""I Was/I Am"" tour. On September 17, 2021, the album was released.

Kahan followed it up with the release of ""Northern Attitude"" on September 16.

On October 14, 2022, Kahan released his album Stick Season. According to early reviews of the album from AP News, ""There’s irony there because these feel like songs both longtime listeners and newer fans will want to belt back to Kahan — not because they’re produced for stadiums or arenas, but because they’re full of nostalgic melodies that will resonate far beyond New England."" Kahan wrote this album during the pandemic which he spent back home in Vermont. Stick Season leans more into the folk genre than the rest of his older music which were more pop sounding. Kahan says that in his album, Stick Season, he wanted to pay homage to the folk singers that he grew up listening to. He adds that his greatest goal as a songwriter is to write music that other people can relate to and to be able to throw that lifeline to someone.

On March 17, 2023, Kahan was featured on Joy Oladokun's single ""We're All Gonna Die"", which was also released as part of her April 2023 album, Proof of Life.

On June 9, 2023, Kahan released a deluxe version of Stick Season titled, Stick Season (We'll All Be Here Forever), which includes seven previously unreleased tracks. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Noah+Kahan"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

106,metronomy,1409264,53022603,"Metronomy is an electropop group which formed in 1999 in Totnes, Devon, United Kingdom, originally as the solo project of Joseph Mount. The project later expanded into a full band, which currently consists of Joseph Mount (vocals, keyboards, guitar), Oscar Cash (keyboards, saxophone, vocals), Gbenga Adelekan (bass, vocals) and Anna Prior (drums, vocals). The band has released five albums: ""Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe)"" (2006), ""Nights Out"" (2008), ""The English Riviera"" (2011), ""Love Letters"" (2014) and ""Summer 08"" (2016).

Metronomy began in the tiny, bohemian market town of Totnes, Devon, when Joseph’s Dad sold his son a computer so he could sit in his bedroom and make electronic music. He was inspired by the likes of Autechre, LFO and Aphex Twin, more as a creative hobby than a pop masterplan.

After decamping to Brighton for Uni, Metronomy released their debut album in June 2006. It was called Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe), and its obtuse but fascinating, largely instrumental electro-pop reflected the eccentricity of its title, and the enduring influence of Totnes.

Joseph admits that he only, finally, saw the commercial possibilities of Metronomy when DJ, producer, Trash founder and electro-punk avatar Erol Alkan began to feature the single You Could Easily Have Me in his sets, and asked Metronomy to play at his club. Cue the need for a proper live show, and the additions of Gabriel Stebbing, Oscar Cash, dance routines and clothes that blink. 

Move on 2 years and Nights Out a wonky love-child of Giorgio Moroder, New Order, Pet Shop Boys and Unfinished Sympathy is a second album that feels like a debut. The first to be vocal-led, with the self-effacing Joseph stepping up and grabbing the mic for most of the tracks; and, crucially, the first to introduce Metronomy as a fully live propsition, rather than a pseudonym for Joseph‘s solo work. 

As Metronomy’s busy touring schedule built a buzz amongst kids who instinctively get the dance/art crossover, In April 2009 the Metronomy show took another leap in its evolution, with the addition for the first time of a live drummer in Anna Prior, and bassist Gbenga Adelekan. The new Metronomy was completely live, proving it is possible for electronic bands to put on show as authentic as any rock band. 

Meanwhile Joseph has embarked on a series of prestigious remixes for the likes of Klaxons, Franz Ferdinand, Gorillaz and collaborations with Kate Nash and Florence and The Machine. Metronomy produced part of the highly acclaimed Roots Manuva album Slime and Reason. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Metronomy"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

109,noga erez,124932,1650079,"Noga Erez is an Israeli musician, singer-songwriter, keyboardist and producer.

Born and living just outside Tel Aviv, multi-instrumentalist Erez’s grainy textures and potent atmospheres forged with her synths and ingenious beats bravely straddle genres, energized further by the environment in which she’s grown up.

While the music she makes in collaboration with her partner and co-writer, composer and producer Ori Rousso exploits many of the more physical dynamic elements of electronic music, it also embraces a cerebral sensitivity that’s made her one of her home city’s most exciting, idiosyncratic artists to date.

For NOGA EREZ, there was never any doubt that, whatever music she chose to make, and whatever she felt about her homeland, she could never ignore her surroundings. After all, even escapism acknowledges there’s something to escape from, and at times – like many who’ve grown up in Tel Aviv – Erez has wanted to shut herself off from a world rendered beyond comprehension by forces beyond her control. But if there’s one thing Erez isn’t – and sometimes it’s easier to say what artists as complex and fresh as her aren’t than are – it’s naïve. And what this means is simple: her work reflects the manner in which she’s learned to live. As she puts it, “I have this idea of giving people moments of thought and inspiration, and at the same time offering escapism and fun.""

It’s not the easiest of goals, but few succeed as well as Erez. While the music she makes in collaboration with her partner and co-writer, composer and producer Ori Rousso, exploits many of the more physical, dynamic elements of electronic music, it also embraces a cerebral sensitivity that’s made her one of her home city’s most exciting, idiosyncratic artists. As inspired by Björk, M.I.A. and fka Twigs as by Flying Lotus, Kendrick Lamar and Frank Ocean, the grainy textures and potent atmospheres forged with her synths and ingenious beats bravely straddle genres, energised further by the environment in which she’s grown up.

Consequently, another of Erez’ goals is, as she puts it, “to process the world, and deliver ideas on how to process it. If you're able to create a musical context that captures the state you were in when you were writing it, that can potentially bring someone closer to understanding their own world.” In her case, this means articulating the fierce anger that lies behind the hypnotically percussive “Dance While You Shoot”, about the realisation that “you can’t live without the government that ensures your basic needs, but at the same time takes your money, keeps you in the dark about the real, important matters that affect your life directly, while drowning you in manipulative media, ignorance and bureaucracy.”

Then there’s the edgy “Pity”, provoked by a court case concerning a gang rape filmed on phones and shared across the web. “We took it to a more day to day level of being a woman in a men’s world, the need to use your ‘feminine’ qualities to get around, and the borders that can be crossed while you try to do that.” And that’s not to mention the extraordinary grit of “Off The Radar”, which addresses contemporary fears of being anonymous or forgotten, and “our indecent urge to leave our mark by publicly sharing thoughts and ideas without due consideration, purely for the rush we get from approval and affirmation.”

Erez was born four days before 1990, the year the Gulf War started, and it would be impossible for her now, as an artist, to ignore what’s been going on around her all her life. Nonetheless, she admits that, for a while, she retreated from the highly politicised climate in which she was raised. “As I became more aware of everything going on – the complexity of the situation, and how it affects lives on both sides – my reaction was to separate myself from it. I got rid of my TV and stopped consuming news completely.”

She found sanctuary in music, but withdrawal is rarely permanent, and if there’s tension in Erez’ work – and there’s plenty, as it happens – then it’s an acknowledgement of this simple truth. “Most of the time it's easy just to ignore what’s happening, but every now and then reality makes that impossible.” Erez is, however, thoroughly self-aware, and acknowledges how “we are very lucky not to live near the borders, not to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, and to have shelters and technology protecting us. But with this sense of luck comes a sense of guilt for being able to do something like make music while lives are being taken.”

Uncompromising and unpredictable, sophisticated and bold, Noga Erez is clear about her ambitions. “Our way of trying to keep in contact with our feelings and fears, and of avoiding emotional detachment about everything, is music. Human beings can come from completely different places but share a fundamental basis of emotions. In my opinion, music is the form of art or communication that expresses that most accurately.” The conversation starts now. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Noga+Erez"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

110,men i trust,1711934,85969403,"Men I Trust is Dragos, Emma, Jessy, Mathieu and Alexis. Founded in 2014, the indie dance band from Montreal, Canada loves smooth sounds, calm melodies and simple rhythms that relax, but make your right foot tap and your chin bounce on the beats. They record, mix, master and shoot their music videos. 

Jessy and Dragos knew each other since their fourth year of high school. Back then (mid-2000’s), Dragos had somewhat of a background in classical piano and Jessy mastered the dark and esoteric art of the metal guitar solist.

In 2012, while finishing his master’s degree in audio postproduction at Laval University, Dragos spent most of his days and sleeping hours at the “LARC” studio working on his solo projects. He randomly met Jessy again, who was finishing his bachelor degree in Jazz guitar, in one of the faculty’s hallways and talked about doing a French-Touch / Italo-Disco track together. Some weeks later, they did just that. And it worked out so well that they decided to extend their collaboration to a whole project where many singers such as Odile Marmet-Rochefort, Gabrielle Shonk, Helena Deland and Geoffroy Sauvé, would be involved.

Between 2012 and 2016, all of Jessy’s and Dragos’ releases were made as part of Dragos’ masters and (dropped) PhD studies in order to gain access to the LARC’s infrastructure and to develop a unique sound.


Emma was a fortuitous encounter. In 2015 a mutual friend presented her to Dragos through a video posted over the Internet. She was casually singing and playing the guitar around a campfire with some of her friends. Emma’s voice was different, being less clear, more grainy and fragile with a mysterious twist that caught their attention. They reached her and tried recording one song called “Out in myself”, which turned to be one of the band’s easiest to record.

Jessy and Dragos then invited her to join them on live shows with Odile at the beginning of 2015. The womans' voices blended wonderfully together and the band got lots of positive feedback from the experience. Emma has been part of Men I Trust since then.

With their second album “Headroom"", Men I Trust truly became a trio. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Men+I+Trust"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

They are known for their delicate tunes, calming voices, and intricately subtle guitar melodies.

After first earning notice thanks to a series of acclaimed European festival appearances during the summer of 1999, the twosome signed to American label Kindercore to issue their lovely eponymous debut the following spring. Quiet Is the New Loud was issued in early 2001 on Astralwerks. The album used many of the same tracks from the Kindercore release but re-ordered them and replaced a few with newer songs. The remix album Versus followed later in the year and featured remixes by artists as diverse as Ladytron, avid Whitaker and Four Tet. After a three year layoff during which Øye recorded a solo album, 2003's Unrest, and gained some reknown as an electronica DJ while Bøe worked on finishing up his psychology degree, the pair teamed up again for the recording and release of 2004's Riot on an Empty Street. 

After a 5 year layoff, the band released Declaration Of Dependence on October 20, 2009 on Astralwerks in the US and Virgin Records in the UK.

Erlend Øye has released some solo material and is also a member of The Whitest Boy Alive.

116,haim,1335769,54139449,"HAIM (pronounced HY-am, meaning ""life"" in Hebrew) is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles. The band consists of three sisters: Este Haim (bass guitar and vocals), Danielle Haim (lead vocals, guitar, and drums), and Alana Haim (guitars, keyboards, and vocals). In addition to their primary instruments, each member is proficient in several others. The group's pop sound on their studio work stands in contrast to the more rock-based music of their live shows. Most frequently compared to Fleetwood Mac, HAIM's sound has been described as ""nu-folk-meets-nineties-R&B"" (by the BBC)  and ""music that sounds like it was written on a lakeside retreat attended by Stevie Nicks, John Waite and En Vogue"" (by the Guardian newspaper).

The sisters grew up in a musical family, and began playing instruments from an early age in the cover band Rockinhaim, fronted by their parents, Moti and Donna. The two elder sisters, Este and Danielle, began performing with the pop group ""Valli Girls"" in 2005. They released a few songs on soundtrack and compilation albums under that name, but left the group shortly after an appearance at the 2005 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. They formed Haim with younger sister Alana in 2007, but did not seriously consider it a professional career for some years. After Danielle became a successful touring guitarist, first with Jenny Lewis and later with Julian Casablancas, Haim reformed as a full-time operation in 2012.

The group's first release, Forever EP (an EP released as a limited-time download), combined with positive reception at the South by Southwest festival, led to a deal with Polydor Records and a management deal with Jay-Z's Roc Nation group in mid-2012. The band began recording material for their first album, Days Are Gone, in sessions between touring dates, including appearances at the Glastonbury Festival. The album charted in the top ten in several countries, including the number-one spot in the UK, and the group had won several ""best of"" awards by the end of 2013. The group was nominated for Best New Artist at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. Their second album, Something to Tell You, was released in July 2017. Their third album, titled Women in Music Pt. III, was released on June 26, 2020. The group received nominations at the 63rd Grammy awards for Album of the Year and Best Rock Performance (for ""The Steps"").

In 2024, the sisters blacked out the band's Instagram, seemingly teasing new music by putting ""writing... writing... writing..."" in the account's bio. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/HAIM"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Their adventure starts with a rather classical approach: arranging playlists fed with music they like. They gradually added what would become their trademark: the grain of a personality's voice on mixed music. Their format is declined during 5 years, 40 mixtapes, more than 70 million listening. A quality signature. Bon Entendeur has this desire to talk about culture in its original version. This sense of aestheticism, of appropriateness. And of the stage. Behind the turntables, they mix their tributes and move the packed halls on a very fine sound. They also have the audacity to never run out of ideas, and in 2015 they offered their first revisit of a song from the 70s, Le temps est bon. A success.

Their album Aller-Retour concentrates their DNA: it is composed of revisited songs from the 60s and 70s and original productions mixed with interviews. All elegantly arranged in 14 tracks. Bon Entendeur creates sounds that are new, that go back and forth with their inventive digital generation and the immense heritage of their predecessors. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Bon+Entendeur"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Paper Planes blend traditional Glaswegian pop and rock sounds (think Camera Obscura, Franz Ferdinand, Orange Juice) with a healthy dose of early American punk, garage, and surf influences. This blend gives them a distinctly muscular sound, especially compared to their indie contemporaries. 

3) Paper Planes (เปเปอร์ เพลน) is a rock band from Bangkok, Thailand. Paper Planes got their first mainstream succes in 2017 when they signed to the label Genie Records with their song ""ก่อนเสียเธอไป"".

The War on Drugs is an American indie rock band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Band member Adam Granduciel (born Adam Granofsky in Dover, Massachusetts) moved from Oakland, California to Philadelphia in  2003, where he met Kurt Vile and began playing music with him. They began playing as The War on Drugs in 2005, and self-released a demo EP. While Vile and Granduciel formed the backbone of the band, they had a number of accompanists early in the group's career, before finally settling on a lineup that added Charlie Hall as drummer/organist, Kyle Lloyd as drummer and Dave Hartley on bass. Granduciel had previously toured and recorded with The Capitol Years, and Vile has several solo albums. The group gave away its Barrel of Batteries EP for free early in 2008. Their debut LP for Secretly Canadian, Wagonwheel Blues, was released in 2008.

Reviewers of the band's music make note of its Americana overtones. The group's sound has been described as influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and My Bloody Valentine.

The lineup underwent several changes, and by the end of 2008, Kurt Vile, Charlie Hall, and Kyle Lloyd had all exited the group. Granduciel and Hartley were joined by drummer Mike Zanghi as the group slimmed to three members.

After Zanghi's exit in 2010, Steven Urgo took over drum duties and  Robbie Bennett joined on keys.   <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+War+on+Drugs"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Their music can be described as a culmination of unique street beat rhythms, psychedelic melodies and organic textures. The band practices and writes music in an out-of-town farm called Harmony Lodge. The group name was inspired by the optical illusion called phantogram.

Barthel and Carter were friends since junior high school. Barthel pursued a visual arts degree while Carter formed the experimental band Grand Habit.

The duo was originally called Charlie Everywhere when performing around the Saratoga Springs area on the local label Sub-Bombin Records.

It wasn’t until four years later that Jordan called Marc to lend vocals to some demos, which were intended as a placeholder. As with the best of accidents, the two liked what they heard and Neil Frances was born.

Jordan grew up in Sydney, then spent time in London, before landing in Los Angeles. Marc, a California native, grew up outside of Los Angeles in Rancho Cucamonga, in a house across the street from his aunt, uncle and cousin. Since childhood, the two found themselves exposed to a range of music, from opera, disco, hip-hop and more, all of which informs their songwriting today.

These influences can be heard on Neil Frances’ dreamy debut EP, Took A While, consisting of five lustrous, reverberating dance tracks featuring one infectious melody after the other. Their sound caught the attention of Jungle and Poolside, who they toured with earlier this year.

Bleachers' debut album Strange Desire was released July 10, 2014, from RCA Records. Variance Magazine called the single ""Rollercoaster"" a ""brilliant summer anthem."" Bleachers went on their debut Come Alive! tour, which features Night Terrors of 1927 and Joywave as opening acts, from March to April 2015. From there, they went on the Strange Desire World Tour from July to November of that same year. They juggled this with the Charli and Jack Do America Tour, a tour co-headlined by Bleachers and Charli XCX.

Bleachers' second album Gone Now was released June 2, 2017. Its lead single ""Don't Take the Money"" has been described by Atwood Magazine as ""an epic uplifting pop-rock anthem ultimately about how when love is real, its worth everything that comes along with it"". In celebration of the album release, he brought his childhood bedroom on tour with him. He had it dismantled and rebuilt inside of a portable trailer. During May and June concerts, fans could enter the ""moving, living art exhibit"" and listen to the album prior to its official release. Antonoff explained in a press release, saying ""when I thought about where this album was coming from and what it’s kissing goodbye I thought of this room. I wished I could play the album for people who care about Bleachers in this space that it is coming from and leaving."" The band was on its Gone Now Era: Part 1 tour from September to November 2017. The tour featured Tove Stryke, Bishop Briggs, and Tangerine as openers. 

In September 2017, Bleachers performed on MTV Unplugged at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The live session was later released as an album, also entitled MTV Unplugged. The album features 11 tracks from both Gone Now and Strange Desire and was released November 10, 2017. Antonoff produced the soundtrack of Love, Simon, released on March 16, 2018. He contributed five songs, with four being credited to Bleachers—""Alfie's Song (Not So Typical Love Song)"", ""Rollercoaster"", ""Keeping a Secret"", and ""Wild Heart""— and one credited to his real name, a duet with MØ titled ""Never Fall in Love"". Throughout 2019, Bleachers released the third volume of Terrible Thrills in a series of four vinyl records, each featuring covers of songs from Gone Now by female artists as well as new demos by Bleachers.

In late 2019, Antonoff began recording the third Bleachers album. During this time the band embarked on a three-day ""mini-tour"" called the ""I Love Making This Album but I'm Also Losing My Mind in Here & Need to Come Out and Play"" Tour. On January 6, 2020, Antonoff announced on Twitter that a new Bleachers album would come within the year. In May, Bleachers was featured on Carly Rae Jepsen's song ""Comeback"" which was the first official release of the band in nearly two years. On the Bleachers Twitter account, a song called ""Take the Sadness Out of Saturday Night"" has been teased for months, and starting on November 14, 2020, a phone tree was set up for fans to call to hear clips from the song. 

On November 16, 2020, Bleachers released the first two singles from Take the Sadness Out of Saturday Night, ""45"" and ""Chinatown"", the latter featuring Bruce Springsteen. The same day it was announced that the album will be released in 2021.  ""Stop Making This Hurt"", the third single, was released on May 18, 2021.

They started out their musical careers at a very young age in Brazilian percussion groups and, due to their Hungarian roots, they are also familiar with traditional Balkan music.

With the release of their “Traphouse Jazz EP“ in 2018 and their debut album “Kamala’s Danz“ in 2020 via Boyoom Connective, Okvsho gained the attention of a wider audience through placements in Bandcamp Weekly, NTS Radio and the very popular Spotify-Playlist “State of Jazz“.
After effortlessly transitioning from sample based bedroom beats and loop heavy productions to self composed songs, Okvsho managed to elevate their sounds even further. Through playing with local jazz-musicians, their live-band project celebrated jazz as dance music with driving rhythms.

Orange wine is made with an ancient production method for natural wines, with as little human intervention as possible and celebrates simplicity and complexity of natural processes, in harmony with the surrounding ecosystem.

The Orange Wine EP, their first release on the label record Hip Dozer, seems like a logical new step for the duo who once again, expanded their musical horizons. For this project, they get back to their roots and combine the simplicity of beat making with the playful and improvised jazz elements the duo is known for. Funkier than ever, their full EP reflects the new exotic vibes of the modern jazz scene.

160,balthazar,330257,9877608,"With hints of neo-psychedelia, electro-pop, and garage punk in their catchy, snarling alternative rock, Belgian group Balthazar formed in Kortrijk in 2004. Their second album, Rats, went all the way to number one in Belgium in 2012.

After starting Balthazar as teenagers, the lineup of Maarten Devoldere (lead vocals/guitar/keyboards), Jinte Deprez (guitar/vocals), and Patricia Vanneste (violin/keyboards/vocals) won a national youth talent competition in 2005 with the song ""Lost and Found."" They included the track on their self-titled debut EP, released in 2006. By then, they had begun touring with additional members Joachim Quartier (bass) and Koen Verfaillie (drums). In early 2007, the rhythm section was replaced by Simon Casier and Christophe Claeys. The following year, the band played their first shows outside of Belgium, visiting nearby countries including France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, and in 2009, they did a club tour of South Africa before returning to the studio.

Their first full-length record, Applause, arrived in March 2010 and spent a week at number 13 on Belgium's album chart. They followed it up with appearances at European summer festivals such as Pukkelpop and Rock Werchter as well as tours in support of the Joy Formidable and dEUS. With mixing by Noah Georgeson (the Strokes, Joanna Newsom), the band's second studio LP, Rats, was released by Play It Again Sam in 2012. It topped the album chart in Belgium, also charting in France and the Netherlands. Featuring the line-up of Devoldere, Deprez, Vanneste, Casier, and drummer Michiel Balcaen, their third long-player, 2015's Thin Walls, was their first with an outside producer, Ben Hillier (Depeche Mode, Blur). It reached the number two spot in their home country and the Top 20 in the Netherlands.

After 14 years in the group, Vanneste parted ways with Balthazar in April 2018. The rest of the members returned with their PIAS-issued fourth album Fever in early 2019. The title track became their first single to chart in Belgium when it debuted at number 47. This was succeeded by 2021 LP Sand: preoccupied with themes of restlessness and waiting, the group's fifth album featured a cover designed by sculptor Margriet Van Breevort.

163,friday pilots club,204955,6270302,"Recently signed to Big Machine/John Varvatos Records (Big Machine Label Group), Friday Pilots Club is Chicago’s Pop affected and hard-hitting Rock band.

Formed in 2017, members Caleb Hiltunen (vocals) and Drew Polovick (guitar) blend explosive memorable hooks and eclectic musical sensibilities to bring a fresh sound to the world of Rock music.

While attending Columbia College Chicago and pursuing different degrees, Caleb and Drew became instant fans of each other’s work. Caleb – a talented lyricist and vocalist – and Drew – a songwriter, producer and master mixer - created the perfect musical partnership with Friday Pilots Club. They gained a loyal Chicago following before gaining the attention of Big Machine’s Scott Borchetta and John Varvatos in 2018.

When Caleb and Drew sat down for their first writing session two years ago, their new single “Glory” was born. A deeply personal track, it was co-produced by Drew alongside Multi-Platinum selling producer John Fields (Switchfoot, American Hi-Fi, All Time Low) and Nothing But Thieves guitarist Dom Craik. A gospel tinged, Rock anthem, “Glory” was inspired from two different perspectives and allows for fans to create their own interpretation. Based on fear of one’s own mortality and the fight for change in the current political climate, “Glory” is available digitally now and is currently being introduced to radio.

Friday Pilots Club recorded “Glory” and additional tracks at Field’s studio in Minneapolis. The environment inspired their creativity and allowed the band to explore diverse sonic possibilities while honing and developing their new sound. Finding influence from bands like Nothing But Thieves, Bring Me The Horizon, Royal Blood, Highly Suspect, along with a dose of The Strokes, Friday Pilots Club found comfort in heavier and darker music. Fans can hear the new music on streaming platforms and live at select tour dates.

A flagship year for Raine was capped off in December, when she performed live with soundtrack legend Hans Zimmer at The Game Awards, the video game industry's flagship annual award show (Celeste was nominated for four awards, and won two).

168,willow,1812776,59452237,"There are at least six artists with this name:
1. Willow Smith, an American pop singer
2. An American instrumental group
3. A Belgian indie rock band
4. An American singer/songwriter
5. A Dutch rock band
6. An American math rock band
7. Sophie Wilson, a UK-based producer.
8. German hard rock band, 1990s.

1. Willow Camille Reign Smith (born October 31, 2000 in Los Angeles, United States) is an American child actress and singer who is the daughter of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. She made her acting debut in 2007 in the film I Am Legend, and was most successful in the film Kit Kittredge: An American Girl where she won the Young artist award for Best Performance in a Feature Film. Apart from her acting she launched a music career in the fall of 2010 with the release of her debut single “Whip My Hair” and signing to Jay-Z’s record label Roc Nation. Willow has released 4 studio albums; her debut, ARDIPITHECUS released in 2015, The 1st released in 2017, WILLOW released in 2019 and lately I feel EVERYTHING released in 2021. She is also part of THE ANXIETY, a collaborative project with Tyler Cole. The projects debut album, THE ANXIETY, was released in 2020.

2. Willow was a four piece instrumental group from Newnan, GA.
Kyle Coleman-Drums/Fast Driving, Matt McClellan-Bass/Keys/Jingle Bells, Tanner Merritt-Guitar/Funny Faces & Rob Sepanski-Mandolin/Violin/Noise 

3. Willow is a young Belgian indie rock band that started in 2007. They create solid, semi-danceable, catchy popsongs with hints of new wave. In their short existence Willow won several rockcontests, with most notably Rockvonk 2009. In 2010 they became 3rd in Humo’s Rock Rally and won the KBC public’s choice award. They are known for their energetic live performance and their refreshing take on music history while still being capable of maintaining their own sound.

4. Willow is a self-taught singer/songwriter, who, in 1992 put down her Bible and picked up a pawn shop guitar. Three chords later, the songs came flowing out. Judging from the fact that she had no subsequent musical experience, one could say she’s a bit of a preternatural chanteuse. Like post-Christian rocker contemporaries, Alice Cooper and Marilyn Manson, Willow’s papa is a preacher man and prior to her fateful leap, she was an enrollee at Multnomah School of the Bible in Portland Oregon. The result of her departure from conservative religion…her musical renderings are of an evolution of a spiritual nature - an earthly, poetic dance in the dark. For those familiar with the fire and brimstone of artist Nick Cave, Willow may be the polar sweet angel of darkness, redemption and desire.

5. Willow was a rock-band from The Hague, The Netherlands. The band was formed by Marlein Heskes-Duarte and Rui Duarte. They’ve had multiple guitar players in the 6 years they made music. The music also changed everytime a new guitar player entered the band. Started out as an alternative rock band, they soon changed their sound to a more punk-rock sound, and in the last year added a nu-metal vibe to their sound.
Willow had some succes in their hometown and surroundings, having played more than a 100 shows, including the Paard van Troje, Plein Open festival, HOT festival and recorded a videoclip in the local tv-studio “TV West” for the song Spinning Around.
The Duarte’s have recently started a new band called Man-Made Madness, which also includes ex-Willow guitar-player Jordy Licht.

6. Willow is a math rock trio from Providence, Rhode Island, United States. Their debut EP, ""Roanoke"" was issued in 2012.

7. Sophie Wilson AKA Willow first made her introduction in 2014 when her debut Feel Me caused a stir when ambient techno veteran Move D included it on his Fabric 74 mix. A year later, the song finally received a proper release on Workshop's compilation EP Workshop 21 – the sub-heavy house tune with an earworm R&B vocal was a highlight on the LP which was number 6 in Resident Advisor tracks of 2015.
 
Rewind two years to the start of an on-going residency in Nottingham for 808, the chance to play alongside Anton Zap, Fred P, Tama Sumo and of course Move D, have shaped and crafted her tastes and DJ style which ranges from house to techno and all that falls in-between.

178,brandi carlile,799262,14716170,"Brandi Carlile (b. June 1, 1981, in Ravensdale, Washington) is an American singer-songwriter, perhaps best known for her 2007 single ""The Story"". Carlile's music has been categorized in several genres, including pop, rock, alternative country, and folk. She released her first album, 'Brandi Carlile', on July 12, 2005.

In the beginning, Columbia Records signed Carlile in late 2004 on the strength of songs she'd been recording periodically at home. Released in 2005, Brandi Carlile showcased those early songs along with several newly recorded tracks. Shortly after the release of Brandi Carlile, she left her home in Seattle and set out with the Hanseroth brothers, with whom she'd worked on her earliest recordings and independent regional tours. The tightly knit trio, which forms the core of her band today, spent the better part of two years on the road honing the songs that would later become part of her album ""The Story"".

In 2005, she was featured on Rolling Stone's ""10 Artists to Watch in 2005"" list. By the end of 2006, Carlile had embarked on several headlining tours and supported a variety of artists including Ray LaMontagne, The Fray, Chris Isaak, Tori Amos, and Shawn Colvin.

Her second album, The Story, was released in April 2007. It was produced by T Bone Burnett and includes a collaboration with the Indigo Girls on ""Cannonball."" The album was recorded in an eleven-day-long session with Carlile , the twins (Tim and Phil Hanseroth) and drummer Matt Chamberlain to capture the raw intensity of Carlile's live performances. The crack in Carlile's vocals during the title track, ""The Story"", came out by accident and was a direct result of the way the album was recorded. Carlile herself describes the vocals as ""technically wrong but emotionally right.""

Carlile was exposed to a wider audience when ABC's Grey's Anatomy showcased three of her songs: ""Tragedy,"" ""What Can I Say,"" and ""Throw It All Away"". In April 2007, Grey's Anatomy debuted a version of the video for the single The Story interspersed with footage from the show. On May 3, 2007, a special two-hour episode of ""Grey's Anatomy"" featured Carlile's song ""Turpentine"" during footage of the ""Grey's Anatomy"" spin-off, ""Private Practice"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

180,sarah kinsley,367575,6976264,"Sarah Kinsley (born in Mountain View, California, on 18 July 2000) is an American alt-pop singer-songwriter of Chinese-American descent. After her song ""The King"" had success on TikTok in 2021, she released an extended play (EP) of the same name, which was listed on NME's list of top debut projects of 2021. Kinsley followed up the project with subsequent EPs, Cypress (2022) and Ascension (2023). In 2024, she released her debut album Escaper. 

Shortly after being born, she moved with her family to the US east coast and settled in Connecticut. While growing up Kinsley spent her time training in classical piano and violin. She took part in performing in youth orchestras. As Kinsley once said regarding music in her youth,"" it was just everything. It was always there. I think that was part of the reason why I had to do music, in some form. At some point, it just became inseparable from life.""

She spent her teen years posting covers of popular artists' music like Justin Bieber and Julia Michaels. Kinsley then took on studying in Singapore until she was contacted by a former classmate, Luc Bradford, that went by the producer name Ford. He had seen her music covers online and was impressed to say the least. Ford looked to make a song with Sarah and ultimately they created the song Craving. This was something Kinsley was proud of so she started sending it to what she'd describe as her good music industry contacts. She received some conflicting comments where these contacts focused on how small a part she played in the song itself. This kickstarted her interest in becoming her very own music producer. 

While studying music theory at Columbia University Kinsley learned that only 2% of producers identify as women. So when she was assigned a project to produce and record several songs she took to it and submitted a song titled Over+Under. Suffice to say she did well in that class. During her time at Columbia University Sarah details the male dominated environment she needed to navigate while learning. Sarah calls out the music industry in saying that it needs to recognize and empower female producers like herself. 

After one of the snippets of a song she was writing went viral on TikTok she was ready to release her second EP titled after the viral sensation, The King. Kinsley toured North America to support her EP release, Cypress. 

In 2021, Kinsley released the extended play (EP) The King, the title track of which went viral on TikTok. 

Subsequent EPs include Cypress (2022) and Ascension (2023). 

In 2024, she released her debut album Escaper. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+Kinsley"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."
181,zoé,382632,19352267,"There are, at least, three artists known as Zoé: 1) A Mexican rock band. 2) An aka of Zoë Pollock (also, aka Zoë). 3) A French-speaking variétés françaises singer.

1) A Mexican rock band, that's not not afraid of experimenting, with a modern sound, an eclectic style, some British influences & overall, their music's sophisticated without loss of rock energy. Their lyrics cover many subjects / feelings, with the same level of sophistication that their music shows, plus honesty. They usually write songs in Spanish, sometimes in English or a combination of both languages.

They began as a band in 1994; as time went by, the band changed members several times until the definite lineup stuck in 1997 with León Larregui (vocals and guitar), Sergio Acosta (guitar), Beto Cabrera (drums), Ángel Mosqueda (bass) and Chucho Báez (keyboards). Then the band made a demo and many gigs on their own with the little resources that they had; with all that, Zoé began to call the attention of the hispanic radio stations in the U.S. Later in 1998, Zoé signed a record deal with Sony Music Mexico and began making their first record in 2000; this album, self titled, came out and quickly became a favorite of the audience in Mexico; after that, the band performed songs in soundracks of movies such as 'Amar Te Duele', 'Ladies Night' and 'The Dreamer'.

Fast forward to 2003. Zoé, along with producer Phil Vinall (Placebo, Elastica, Pulp), recorded their second album called 'Rocanlover', which became more successful than the first one thanks to hit songs like 'Peace & Love' and 'Veneno', which aired in several TV countdowns.

In 2005, after three years of working together, Zoé left Sony Music because of the lack of real interest that this record label had in them and signed a new deal with Noiselab; with a newfound belief in record labels, Zoé made an EP called 'The Room', which debuted at the top of the rankings in Mexico. This EP includes, among others, the song 'Dead' (first single); also,are including ""She Comes"" and ""Morning Watts"" as new songs  and also some remixes of ""Dead"" by great electronic artists from Mexico such as Sonido Lasser Drakkar or Los Dynamite, plus a couple of videos.

On July 12th, 2006; Zoé (now wih Rodrigo Guardiola in the drums) presented their more recent production, ""Memo Rex Commander y el Corazón atómico de la Vía Láctea"", a sophisticate, layered production, which tops several magazines' rankings. Both Zoé and producer Phil Vinall worked very hard in Tornillo, Texas, a remote town in the desert, to get ""Memo Rex"" finished.

In fall 2006, Zoé headlined the Rockampeonato Tour, along with other Noiselab signees like Los Dynamite and Los Odio!, which held shows at cities like Mérida, Guadalajara and many others. This is the biggest tour Zoé has been a part of since they were formed.

In 2007 Zoé recorded ""281107"", a live album that celebrates their first 10 years as a band, it was recorded on the Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City, this recording went platinum pretty quickly which is something unusual for live recordings in Mexico. On November 11th 2008 ""Repileptric"" Zoé's seventh studio album was released.

2) An alias of Zoë Pollock (b. in Peckham, London, UK - aka Zoë, Zoe, Hepzibah Broom & Pollack), is a pop / rock / folk singer who began her career in the mid-80s, dated Martin Glover (aka Youth, who produced her early work), released three solo albums (two as Zoë, another as Hepzibah Broom) & several singles. She is now a member of Mama.

Her 1991 début, Scarlet Red And Blue (originally, released as Zoë's Scarlet Red And Blue), contained Sunshine On A Rainy Day & ""Lightning"" (aka Sunshine On A Rainy Day & Lightning, with 'Zoe' spelling), which have been her biggest hits, to date (peaking at #4 & #37, respectively - on the UK chart).

In 1996, Zoë re-emerged - still with M & G Records & bringing a revamped image / style / sound - releasing an americana-styled rock album, Hammer.

Re-emerging again, around 2008, she has released Hepzibah Broom (as Hephzibah Broom) & formed female folk duo 'Mama' (with singer Sarah McQuaid - their début release is Crow Coyote Buffalo).

187,radiohead,7018202,985538001,"Radiohead is an English alternative rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.

Radiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, Pablo Honey, in 1993; their debut single, ""Creep"", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of The Bends in 1995. Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.

Radiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though Kid A divided listeners, it later attracted wide acclaim. It was followed by Amnesiac (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Hail to the Thief (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, was Radiohead's final album for EMI.

Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.

By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: ""Creep"" (1992), ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"" (1996), ""Paranoid Android"" (1997), ""Karma Police"" (1997), ""No Surprises"" (1998), ""Pyramid Song"" (2001), and ""There There"" (2003). ""Creep"" and ""Nude"" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s. Five Radiohead albums have been included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time lists. Radiohead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.

193,claire rosinkranz,558490,8173994,"California native Claire Rosinkranz is best known for her lo-fi pop EP BeVerly Hills BoYfRiEnd, which includes Backyard Boy; her massive viral hit. 

Her overnight success might not come as a surprise to all, as Rosinkranz has been writing songs since she was 8. Filling notebooks and iPads with lyrics, turns of phrase, and poems, the homeschooled artist would spend hours writing lyrics to songs that didn’t exist yet. Sometimes, she’d help her musician father, Ragnar, with melodies and lyrics for songs he’d been tasked to compose for TV shows and ad jingles. 

Claire describes her style as alternative blues-pop, equally as inspired by early influences (like The Beatles’ Help!, Frank Ocean, and the Jack Johnson songs the family would listen to around the house) as it is by the singer-songwriter’s contemporaries, like Benee, Bruno Major, and Still Woozy. 

Claire traffics in lo-fi songs with intricate yet totally relatable lyrics about friendship, crushes, family, and feelings. They plumb the depths of the human condition in very short bursts, exposing the songwriter’s remarkable emotional maturity and strong, singular grasp on her sound. Narratively, tracks like “Tough Guy” and “Seriouslaaay” follow Claire’s stories from start to finish while Ragnar’s clean, crisp production buoys his daughter’s crystal-clear vocals. “He totally captures my vision and if I don’t like something, I’m not afraid to say it,” Claire says of her dad. “Because we’re able to communicate so well, the process happens so quickly.”

The “star of the show,” Claire says of her catalogue, is “Backyard Boy,” the final song she wrote for the EP and one that grew legs of its own shortly after release, achieving massive viral success all on its own. “I was getting DMs from people telling me that ‘Backyard Boy’ was doing really well on TikTok,” she remembers. “Then, friends started texting me. Then more people were texting me. So I opened TikTok and I had 300,000 videos under the song and realized, “Oh, this is a thing!”

Signing to slowplay/Republic Records in 2020, Claire realized the work and dedication she’d been putting into music for half her life was coming to fruition. In August, she shot the “Backyard Boy” music video but kept things close to the family, as she’s done for years (it’s directed by her uncle, the first AD is her cousin, and close family friends star alongside her onscreen). “I think people are connecting to that song because it’s about a feeling you long for, especially during this time,” she says. “Everyone wants to have this experience but it’s something we can’t have right now because of COVID. But ‘Backyard Boy’ makes you feel like you can.”

Claire has spent a few years drilling down on her craft by refining her songwriting and learning to play instruments like the ukulele, the piano, and the jazz electric guitar (“that’s the one I absolutely enjoy the most,” she says), which have helped her turn her lyrics into fully imagined soundscapes. “I consider myself a writer first and foremost,” she’s quick to note. “I’m super fortunate to be able to sing all my songs, and I want to sing them, but writing is my favorite part of the entire process.” <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Claire+Rosinkranz"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

194,grandson,679367,19666359,"Grandson is an alternative artist hailing from Toronto, Canada. Born in the small town of Englewood New Jersey, he relocated to the cultural melting pot of Toronto at a young age, and grew up surrounded by music ranging from jazz to rock and roll to rap, dancehall and r&b. He began playing guitar and piano in high school.

At 17, he relocated to Montreal, QC to attend university, and began working in nightclubs cleaning tables and DJing. He started writing music at this time, incorporating the unique blend of sounds he grew up surrounded by. He started experimenting with music production and rapping in 2013, and dropped out of school to relocate to Los Angeles and pursue music full time.

Adopting the Grandson moniker while living in LA, he dove deeply into rock influences such as Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana, and Led Zeppelin, while also listening to rap/R&B music emerging out of Toronto and alternative acts such as Twenty One Pilots and Hiatus Kaiyote. He found a small community of musicians to work and perform with here in Los Angeles. The live tries to create a frantic, mosh pit-inducing cathartic release of energy for concert-goers, influenced by early punk and grunge music.

Searching for his voice and for meaning in today’s divisive, chaotic world, Grandson confronts the most pressing issues of his generation through his songwriting, such as financial inequality, governmental and environmental accountability, and social justice, giving these topics a soundtrack with a genuine sense of urgency and frustration. The music also touches on adolescence, relationships, and the insecurities and difficulties of growing up through your 20s. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Grandson"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Entrambi arrivano a Milano con lo stesso sguardo spaesato e meravigliato delle matricole universitarie, di chi lascia la cittadina per cercare fortuna nella metropoli. Decidono di raccontarla, di descrivere quello che vedono attraverso le loro lenti colorate da fragili emozioni, da affitti e bollette, da incontri ed esperienze in cui chiunque può identificarsi ma che nessuno ha mai sentito raccontare con toni così originali, freschi.

Tra febbraio e giugno 2017 pubblicano quattro video, nell’autunno dello stesso anno esce Inverno Ticinese, un concept EP di tre brani con relativi video. Il risultato è esplosivo: i Coma_Cose respirano l’aria urbana e riescono a concretizzarla in suono, parole e soprattutto immagine. Diventano una coppia che appaga l’orecchio non meno di quanto faccia con l’occhio, senza staccarsi dal tessuto che ha fatto la loro fortuna, semplicemente colorandolo di sfumature.

La storia che è emersa da quell’incontro inaspettato racconta ora un mondo di piccole cose, che poi sono quelle che riguardano tutti ed è così che il pubblico ha capito la caratura di un duo con cui condividere la quotidianità, raccontata però come solo gli artisti sanno fare. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Coma_Cose"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2)  Heroes of the modern garage revival, the Wombats were born sometime in the late 70s, somewhere in the leafy lanes of Maple Heights, Ohio. Teenage guitar strangler John Zinrich, a.k.a. Johnny Fettish (so called because he had a thing for biting women's knees under tables, hence ""John Knee Fetish""), had previously lived out the punk ideal by dropping out of high school at age 15 to join Public Enemy, noted in Cle 3.0 for doing ""the fastest version ever attempted of 'I Wanna Be Your Dog'."" Striving for a poppier sound, Fettish and his suburban neighbor Vic Halm penned a series of power-punk pop gems and entered the first national ""Battle of the Garages"" competition run by Bomp/Voxx honcho Greg Shaw. The 'Bats contributed a track, ""The Reason Why"" to the first ""Battle"" compilation and played on the national ""Battle"" tour in 1981. Positive public reaction won them a recording contract, and between 1981 and 1984 the 'Bats released two singles and an album, ""Zontar Must Die!"" on Bomp/Voxx. They also played various notable East Coast and local venues, including the first WRUW Studio Arama show and the opening night of the Lakefront (which displayed ""Wombats"" on its curb sign for several years as a result). Their energetic live show was notable for speedy fuzzy guitars pumped through Marshall stacks, unintelligible vocals, and the sight of 5'4"" Fettish leaping two feet in the air, against a backdrop of six-foot-tall John Lennon-lookalike Halm and equally towering bassist Tim Ratley. In 1984 the Wombats played a show with the seminal Columbus band Great Plains, who brought them to the attention of Gerard Cosloy at Homestead Records. The Wombats subsequently recorded one EP for Homestead, ""Mudpuddles"", which came out in 1985. Unfortunately, the band had a falling out with Cosloy over their inability to tour, since drummer Tommy Edwards was busy studying to be a refrigerator repairman. As a result, promotion for ""Mudpuddles"" was almost nil and the 'Bats found themselves once again without a label. In 1986, Fettish and Halm wrote and recorded some excellent demos for a third album which they hoped to place on a major label, but due to lack of interest this project never saw the light of day. Since then, the 'Bats have played sporadically around Cleveland with various lineups. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Wombats"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

 In 2021, Sodikken announced that they would be making their own animated series, ""Blood and Skinny Hedgehog"", which has yet to come out. Sodikken has not released any new songs since 2022, most likely because they are still working on ""Blood and Skinny Hedgehog"".

205,metric,2395022,88153411,"Metric is an indie rock/New Wave band formed in 1998 in Toronto, Canada. The band members are Emily Haines (vocals, synths, guitar, tambourine), James Shaw (guitar, synths, theremin, backing vocals), Josh Winstead (bass, synths, backing vocals) and Joules Scott-Key (drums). The band name was inspired after a sound called ""Metric"" that was programmed by Shaw on his keyboard. They were based at various times at Toronto, Montreal, London, NYC and LA.

So far, Metric has released eight studio albums: Old World Underground, Where Are You Now? (2003), Live It Out (2005), Grow Up and Blow Away (2007), Fantasies (2009), Synthetica (2012), Pagans in Vegas (2015), Art of Doubt (2018), and Formentera (2022).

Besides Metric, Emily Haines and James Shaw also perform with Broken Social Scene. Joules Scott-Key and Joshua Winstead have their own side project, Bang Lime. Emily Haines released her debut album Cut in Half and Also Double in 1996 and two records under the moniker Emily Haines & the Soft Skeleton: the album Knives Don't Have Your Back in 2006 and the 6-track EP What Is Free to a Good Home? in 2007. She also has been a guest on albums by Stars, The Crystal Method, KC Accidental, Delerium, The Stills and Jason Collett.

Emily Haines was born in New Delhi, India and raised since the age of 3 in Peterborough, Ontario. The daughter of poet Paul Haines grew up as a dual citizen of Canada and India. Her father would often make cassettes of rare and eclectic music for his daughter to listen to and her early influences included Carla Bley and Robert Wyatt. By her teens she followed her parents' footsteps by attending the Etobicoke School of the Arts. There she met Amy Millan and Kevin Drew, with whom she would later collaborate in hHead. Haines and Millan briefly formed their first band around 1990 while at ESA and with songs later written and recorded while at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver in 1992–1993, at Toronto in 1995 and at Concordia University in Montreal in 1995–1996, Haines distributed in 1996 an early effort called Cut in Half and Also Double with a limited number of copies.

James Shaw was born in the UK. He was a student at a Boston music school and was friends with Torquil Campbell, a vocalist who would later form Stars and Chris Seligman, the future synthesizer player of Stars. Torquil had plans to move to New York City and on his suggestion Shaw applied to Juilliard Music School and moved to New York with him. In 1998, Shaw and Torquil returned to Toronto, where Haines met Shaw through mutual friends in the local music scene. Shaw moved to Montreal where Haines was still living and the two worked on filling out each other's projects. The first song made by Shaw and Haines was ""Butcher"" and eventually they had completed in 1998 several other tracks in their home studio, gathered on Mainstream EP, a collection of demos with an overall downtempo and electronic feel.

In the fall of 1998, Shaw moved back to New York City, this time accompanied by Haines, Campbell and Seligman. There they shared a loft in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. During their two-year stay at the loft, Haines and Shaw were erstwhile room mates with future members of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Liars and TV on the Radio. 

Haines and Shaw set off to London in early 2000 and signed a publishing deal with Chrysalis Records. With the help of producer Stephen Hague, Metric worked on a new batch of New Wave/electropop drum-machine paced songs that would form the nucleus of their debut album. The effort dubbed Grow Up and Blow Away, revealed a more musically-layered and mature sound than the earlier Mainstream EP. Haines and Shaw completed the album in April 2001 and by this time had found a label for their release, Restless Records. The album was delayed for years by their record label. 

The band performed in New York in early Spring and late Summer 2001, personally circulating handmade CD-R copies of their unreleased music to fans at shows and by mail, eventually giving the music away for free on the internet. Metric at the time was for the most part a studio band and live shows approximated the synthesizer-centered and drum-machine driven sound of the recordings. In the same year they issued a 5-track EP entitled Static Anonymity and two promo singles: ""Grow Up and Blow Away"" and ""Raw Sugar"".

In the winter of 2001, Metric had gained two new bandmates: the drummer Joules Scott-Key (born in Flint, Michigan) and the bass player Joshua Winstead. Joules Scott-Key was attending college in Texas was in town with his friend Joshua Winstead performing in the local music scene. Scott-Key and Winstead had known each other for about a decade and they met Shaw and Haines at the Brooklyn loft and at local performances.

On 2 September 2003, Metric released their first official studio album Old World Underground, Where Are You Now? on Last Gang Records. The album was received with positive reviews and it has gone gold in Canada. They released 2 singles from the album, ""Combat Baby"" and ""Dead Disco"".

On 27 September 2005, the band released their second studio album, Live It Out on Last Gang Records. The album was well received and has since gone twice platinum in Canada, selling over 200,000 units. They issued 4 singles: ""Monster Hospital"", ""Poster of a Girl"", and ""Empty"". The band has toured the world extensively for several years. They also opened for The Rolling Stones in NYC.

On 26 June 2007, Last Gang Records released Metric's 2001 album Grow Up and Blow Away, after purchasing the rights to the album from band's previous label. In 2007 they released a live EP entitled Live at Metropolis followed a year later by a DVD with the same name featuring a concert recorded from Montreal.

On 7 April 2009, Metric released their fourth album Fantasies on their own label, Metric Music International. In the US it debuted at #1 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers and peaked at #76 on the Billboard 200, in Canada it debuted at #13 on the Canadian Albums Chart and peaked at #6 and in Australia, the album debuted at #48. The album received mostly positive reviews and it's their most successful record to date. They released 6 singles: ""Help I'm Alive"", ""Front Row"", ""Gimme Sympathy"", ""Sick Muse"", ""Gold Guns Girls"" and ""Stadium Love"".

Amazon.com listed Fantasies in eleventh in its ""Best Albums of 2009"" list. This album was a shortlisted nominee for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize and also won two Casby Awards, the NXNE favourite new indie release award and favourite new album award. On 18 April 2010, the album won the Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year at the 2010 Awards, as well as the band winning Group of the Year.

On 27 October 2009, Metric released a 5-track EP called Plug In Plug Out containing acoustic versions of five songs from Fantasies. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Metric, along with several other Canadian music acts, came together in Vancouver to re-record K'Naan's song ""Wavin' Flag"" to benefit Haiti in a movement called Young Artists for Haiti. 

In 2010, the band contributed to Twilight: Eclipse movie soundtrack with a song entitled ""Eclipse (All Yours)"". In the same year, a previously unreleased song ""Black Sheep"" was used on the soundtrack of the movie Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. In 2011, Metric issued the live EP iTunes Session.

On 18 September 2015, Metric released their sixth album, Pagans in Vegas.

On September 21, 2018, Metric released their seventh album, Art of Doubt.

209,drama,278181,3196071,"There are many bands/artists called Drama.

As of early 2019, the Drama appearing at the top of this chart is Chicago ""soulful electronic"" duo Na'el Shehade & Via Rosa, who have been active since 2015..

1. A Turkish indie/post-rock/shoegaze band. Their most popular release is ""Yalnız Bir Duygu"".

2. A Russian Black Metal band formed in 2001.
The band was formed in June, 2001 when Vindsarg and Dym left their previous project Blackart (melodic black/death metal) and decided to create something more serious. Zah (Ninzah, ex-Dethroner) joined the band, which took on the name Drama. In November, 2002 the band had its first appearance on stage in native Yeisk. In two months Elymas (keyboards), who added wishful atmosphere, joined the band.

The debut Drama's album ""Silver Brilliance Of Nocticula"" was recorded shortly after demo tape Wintercrown"" in 2003. A short time later Elymas left the band because of a fatal accident. As a result of making a contract with Black Side Productions (Saint-Petersburg) ""Silver Brilliance Of Nocticula"" was released as MC (1000 copies) in December, 2003. Then Drama started working on the stuff for the next album.

In February, 2004 Drama came to Kazan for recording the second album Winds Choir Opera"". The record was being made in Grindsound studio for six days. Afterwards the band started giving concerts steadily. At that time T (keyboards) was taken to Drama as a session musician. Soon she became its full member.

At the turn of 2004 Serg replaced the second guitarist and joined Drama. In April, 2005 there was made a contract with Musica Productions (Moscow) for the releasing of CD ""Winds Choir Opera"". And it was already put up for sale in May! That time Zah left the band because of Drama's removal for permanent residence from Yeysk to Saint-Petersburg.

In May, 2005 Musica Prod. released the album ""Winds Choir Opera"". And on 18 June, 2005 Drama took part in Unholy Storm Festival (Saint-Petersburg) with its new stuff: Vindsarg - guitar / scream, Serg - guitar, Erier - 5 string bass, Dym – drums battery, T - keyboards. There was made an official statement about band's definitive removal to Saint-Petersburg. In the end of 2005 the band makes one more contract with Musica Prod. for releasing the remastered re-release debut album “Silver Brilliance of Nocticula”.

In June, 2006 Erier (bass) left the band. More than six months they were looking for the new bass-guitarist and as the result a lot of plans were frustrated. About 30 candidates were tested. Only in January,2007 Larsson joined the band (founder and ex-leader of Black-metal band Serpents).

3. Drama, born Keith Morgan, a talented rapper from the state of Georgia in the US. His music is described as purely Southern-fried sound, with hyperkinetic beats, operatic electronica backing, and lyrical flows in which every breath seems destined to be his last.   Drama's impassioned, gruff growl lies somewhere between Ja Rule's and that of most of the No Limits posse. His song, ""Left, Right, Left"" was a club and radio hit.

4. Drama, a progressive rock band from france.   In their beginnings they tried unsuccessfully to re-create the spirit of the 70’s but without inspiration is not much what you can accomplish but they improved with the pass f the years..   The band was formed in the mid 90’s in Rouen - France and in 1995 they release their first self titled album with Eric Azhar in the guitars, Jean-François Duboc playing bass, Laurent Guilhot the drummer, Richard Langlois in the keys and Jean-Marc Leclerc adds additional percussion, in track four.

There are a few things this guys should know, not everybody is able to play in the Genesis style and be successful, good instrumental debut but still it was evident something was missing and IMO it was ambition.  For their second release “Flying through the 21st Century” (1998), Jean-Marc Leclerc and Richard Langlois leave the band so Eric Azhar takes the keyboards and they recruit a vocalist named Louis de Fusco. In the first album the main problem is the lack of ambition, well they went to the other extreme, still keeping the main Genesis influence, they add ethnic influences from Africa, Asia and even the opener named “La Magna Carta” with bagpipes, maybe they should stick to one sound and stop wandering, but still musically is a big evolution.  Now the problem is the high pitched vocalist de Fusco, they should have remained as an instrumental band, the guy really wasn’t in the level for the band, the consequence was evident, the critics were devastating but they keep going.  In the year 2000 DRAMA was invited to Baja Prog where along with AFTER CRYING, ECLAT, ISILDURS BANE and PALLAS received the bet critics, surely their sound was already improving more.  In the year 2005, DRAMA surprises us with a their album called “Stigmata of Changes” with a completely different lineup formed by Azhar (Who claims back the guitar) and Duboc from the original formation plus a new keyboardist Ralph Adam and of course a new vocalist named Yvon Lucas.  The change is for good, Lucas is far better than his predecessor, his voice is soft and gentle but serves perfectly for their new material and Adam’s keyboards are pretty decent, heavily influenced by Genesis and Pink Floyd again with some bluesy and Folk influences.  This album is pretty good and makes us believe they can keep improving as they done through their career, hope this time we won’t have to wait 7 years for a new release

5. a Norwegian pop band from Larvik. They became a sensation when debuting on national television with the song ""Daydreamer (Breaking Away)"" as teenagers.

6. Drama was a very short-lived progressive rock band from The Netherlands (1971-1973), which was a bit of a 'supergroup' of sorts. Band members such as Polle Eduard (ex-Tee Set) and Shell Schellekens (ex-The In Crowd and Big Wheel) had previously played in succesful groups. The band recorded just one studio album - and folded shortly after its release. The Dutch hit single, 'Mary's Mamma' (#20 in 1972), is very untypical for the band's musical style.

7. The categorical beat-master McKaras from Lithuania

8. Drama, better known as DJ Drama, is a famous hip-hop DJ. His most featured artist TI tips his cap the same way that DJ Drama does, except drama's cap it toward the back. He's a part of the clique, the Affiliates.

9. Croatian Doom Sludge Metal
Deadweight Loss was founded in 2004 as a trio featuring: Ognjen - drums, Stjepan - bass and Bruno - guitar. The initial idea was to play covers of Crowbar, Down and similar sludgecore bands but from the very begining there was a certain ""creative vibe"" surrounding the band so in just 2 months the band wrote 4 songs. After 8 months, Goran - guitar, joined the band and the band continued to evolve in new directions. After his arrival, the band continued working on their songs with more passion and creativity. Finally, after more than a year, Marko - vocals , joined the band and Deadweight Loss , at last , started to function as a whole unit . The first gig was played in club Mochvara 29.04.2005.

12.04.2006. band recorded their first demo with 9 songs. After the recording process, Ognjen (drums) quit playing in Deadweight Loss. In the summer of 2006, after a long search, Matko joined the band and filled Ognjen's place perfectly. In the meantime, the band created 3 new songs which are conceptually quite different from the first few , so in that vein band changed their name from Deadweight Loss to - (drama). 

10. Drama is fast and political HARDCORE / PUNK band from Barcelona. Strong antiauthoritarian, feminist and antifascist beliefs.

210,flying lotus,1386592,68875896,"Regarded upon his 2006 arrival as a promising beatmaker looming in the shadows of J Dilla, Madlib, and Dabrye, Steven Ellison -- known as Flying Lotus -- nullified all comparisons only two years later with Los Angeles. On that album, his first of five for the Warp label, Ellison distilled a uniquely crisp, spasmodic, and heady sound with elements of hip-hop, avant-garde jazz, IDM, and dubstep. While the abovementioned producers fueled Ellison, he had also been excited as a youngster by the '90s West Coast rap classics that combined programming and live instrumentation. His sound continued to develop as he put his own twist on the approach, recording with a crop of jazz musicians including the indispensable likes of bassist Thundercat and strings master Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. This process began with the turbulent 2010 set Cosmogramma and peaked in terms of acclaim in 2014 with You're Dead!, which crashed the Top 20 of the Billboard 200 and spawned the Kendrick Lamar collaboration ""Never Catch Me,"" a Grammy nominee for Best Dance Recording. Ellison devoted a few years to various forms of film work and the operation of his revered Brainfeeder label, and returned in 2019 with Flamagra, his second consecutive album to top Billboard's Dance/Electronic chart. After he was Grammy-nominated for Producer of the Year, he provided the score for the 2021 anime series Yasuke.

Steven Ellison was born in Los Angeles and raised in the city's Winnetka neighborhood. He is the grandson of Marilyn McLeod, a songwriter and producer known for co-writing hits such as Diana Ross' ""Love Hangover"" and Jermaine Jackson's ""Let Me Tickle Your Fancy."" Additionally, Ellison is the grand-nephew of visionary jazz artists Alice Coltrane (McLeod's sister) and John Coltrane. His cousins include Ravi and Oran Coltrane, the latter of whom introduced him to electronic music production and gave him his first piece of gear, a Roland MC-505 groovebox. Drawn first to filmmaking -- he made stop-motion clips in his youth, using action figures and a camcorder -- Ellison obtained a degree from Los Angeles Film School and continued at the Academy of Art in San Francisco. After a short period in the Bay Area, he returned to L.A. and in 2004 started working as an intern for Peanut Butter Wolf's Stones Throw label, which enabled him to cross paths with inspirations such as J Dilla and Madlib. All the while, Ellison had continued to work on music, particularly taken with the Akai MPC sampler. In response to an open call from Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block, Ellison submitted tracks, and soon had them licensed for use between segments and commercial breaks.

Ellison debuted officially as Flying Lotus in 2006, the year he connected with Plug Research, a crucial outlet of Los Angeles' emerging beat scene. His ""Two Bottom Blues"" appeared beside tracks by established contemporaries such as Daedelus, Sa-Ra, and Georgia Anne Muldrow on Carlos Niño Presents the Sound of L.A. A couple months later, he provided a remix for Mia Doi Todd's La Ninja: Amor and Other Dreams. That October, Plug Research released 1983, Ellison's first album. Titled after his birth year, it was created in solitude with the exception of the cosmic ""Unexpected Delight,"" featuring vocals from Laura Darlington -- a frequent collaborator for years to come. Signal-boosting support came most prominently from BBC DJ Gilles Peterson. The next year, U.K. underground institution Warp Records signed Ellison and issued the Reset EP -- another October delivery -- on which Ellison's sound became more distinct. This time, Andreya Triana joined Ellison on the woozy opener ""Tea Leaf Dancers,"" a signature early track.

Meanwhile, Ellison had become a major catalyst in the activity emanating from Low End Theory, a weekly club night -- and public salon of sorts for aspiring beatmakers and other musicians -- held in L.A.'s Lincoln Heights neighborhood. Local groundswell and an increasing international profile combined to make Ellison's first Warp LP a subcultural event. The definitively titled Los Angeles arrived in June 2008, entered Billboard's Dance/Electronic Albums chart at number 16, and months later was hailed by several music publications as one of the year's best albums. Ellison incorporated vocals from Laura Darlington, Gonjasufi, and Dolly, but he also received co-production input from fellow native Californians and L.A. transplants. Three of them -- Gaslamp Killer, Samiyam, and MatthewDavid -- soon helped build the catalog of Ellison's Brainfeeder label, launched the same year and named after the opening track of Los Angeles. By August 2009, Warp had also dispersed L.A. EP 1 X 3, L.A. EP 2 X 3, and L.A. EP 3 X 3, a trilogy of short-form releases containing previously unreleased cuts and remixes. One of the remixes came from eventual Brainfeeder artist Martyn, affirming Ellison's enthusiastic tracking of pre-commercial dubstep. Around that time, Ellison also remixed a Martyn production and made his first in a handful of appearances on the Hyperdub label.

One of many formative inspirations for Ellison was West Coast rap -- G-funk especially -- that integrated programming and live instrumentation. For the producer's next album, he took the concept to the hilt, albeit with a result that moved him closer to modern electric avant-garde jazz than to lowrider classics. Released in May 2010, Cosmogramma was a turning point for Ellison, made with instrumentalists such as bassist and vocalist Thundercat, violinist and arranger Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, harpist Rebekah Raff, and Ellison's cousin, tenor saxophonist Ravi Coltrane. Darlington, Niki Randa, and Radiohead's Thom Yorke also provided vocals on one track each. Just as significantly, Ellison incorporated sounds from medical equipment recorded in the hospital room of his mother, who died just before the album began to take shape. Even though the placement of those recordings isn't as obvious as, say, a Thundercat bassline, heavy-hearted sentiments were made evident throughout. Cosmogramma reached number three on the Dance/Electronic Albums chart and was the first Flying Lotus LP to hit the Billboard 200, registering at number 88. The supplemental Pattern+Grid World EP was out a few months later.

Until the Quiet Comes, the dreamlike fourth Flying Lotus album, was out in September 2012. Spacier and pared down in relation to Cosmogramma, it still found room for the likes of Thundercat, other Brainfeeder affiliates including keyboardists Austin Peralta and Brandon Coleman, and Atwood-Ferguson. Darlington, Randa, and Yorke likewise added ghostly vocals, as did Erykah Badu. It cracked the Top 40 of the Billboard 200, peaking at number 34, and narrowly missed the top of the Dance/Electronic chart. Ellison then bolted in the opposite direction and reached a new level of acclaim with his next work. You're Dead!, released in October 2014, used many of the players familiar to Flying Lotus sessions -- plus Herbie Hancock, rising Brainfeeder addition Kamasi Washington, and Snoop Dogg, as well as Ellison under his rapping Captain Murphy guise -- and multiplied the intensity. The thrashing LP scraped the Top 20 of the Billboard 200 and topped Dance/Electronic Albums. ""Never Catch Me,"" featuring Kendrick Lamar, was nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Dance Recording. Ellison had co-produced ""Wesley's Theory"" for Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly, a contender for Album of the Year, making him a two-time nominee.

Brainfeeder inevitably branched into film production, beginning with the biological horror-comedy vignette Royal and the 2017 parent feature Kuso, both directed by (and featuring music from) Ellison. Additionally, Flying Lotus was the name credited with the music for the short Blade Runner Black Out 2022, among some other visual projects that reached the public in the mid- to late 2010s. Ellison ended the longest period between Flying Lotus albums in May 2019 with Flamagra. Put together over the intervening years, it threw Brainfeeder signee George Clinton, Solange, Anderson .Paak, Shabazz Palaces, and Tierra Whack, among several other guests, into the mix. A central role was played by director David Lynch, who spun a tale about an inferno threatening to engulf a neighborhood. Flamagra became the second Flying Lotus LP to top the Dance/Electronic Albums chart, and debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 45. He continued to work closely with Thundercat on the bassist's 2020 release It Is What It Is; it won a Grammy for Best Progressive R&B Album, and the same year, Ellison was among the nominees for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical. Returning to film work, Ellison composed the soundtrack to the 2021 Netflix anime series Yasuke, based on a 16th century Black samurai. ""The Room,"" a neo-soul single featuring singer Devin Tracy, appeared in 2022.

211,viagra boys,350977,13054200,"Generating a singular brand of noisy chaos, Swedish post-punk band Viagra Boys fuse pounding hard rock grooves, minimalist melodies, discordant guitar and sax, and howling vocals into an uncompromised volley of sound. Fascinated with drugs, anger, and the evils of male privilege, Viagra Boys became a cult phenomenon in their homeland before word spread throughout Europe, the United Kingdom, and North America about their punishing and articulate approach. After making their recording debut and setting their creative template with the 2016 EP Consistency of Energy, Viagra Boys both refined and sharpened their signature sound on their first full-length album, 2018's Street Worms. The album's strong critical reception helped bolster enthusiasm for their follow-up, Welfare Jazz, which appeared in early 2021.

Viagra Boys formed in 2015 in Stockholm, Sweden. Tattoo artists Henrik Höckert and Sebastian Murphy (the latter born in San Francisco but living in Stockholm) met through a mutual acquaintance and went out for a night of drinking. The two ended up at a karaoke bar, and after hearing Murphy belt out a unique version of Mariah Carey's ""We Belong Together,"" Höckert decided they needed to form a band. With Murphy on lead vocals and Höckert on bass, they recruited guitarist Benjamin Vallé, who had previously worked with Höckert in the group Nitad. With the addition of drummer Sol Tor Sjödén, the core of the group was complete and they began writing songs.

By the time Viagra Boys started playing out in June 2015, they'd added Oskar Karls on sax and producer Martin Ehrencrona on keyboards. By 2016, they decided it was time to document their music, and they cut a four-song EP, Consistency of Energy, issued by Kosmos Recordings. The Push My Buttons label brought out their second record, the 2017 EP Call of the Wild, but for their first full-length album, 2018's Street Worms, they signed with Year0001 Records, putting them on the same label as Swedish rapper Yung Lean. If the band was uncomfortable with the association, they didn't show it, and Street Worms got enthusiastic reviews while the tracks ""Sports"" and ""Just Like You"" earned enough streaming plays and video views to raise their following beyond the underground. Viagra Boys' unpredictable live show was documented on a 2019 concert recording, Shrimp Sessions, that was released only in Japan. In April 2020, Viagra Boys were back with their first studio recordings since Street Worms, a forceful four-song EP titled Common Sense. This was followed in January 2021 by Welfare Jazz, their chaotic and subversively satirical sophomore full-length. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Viagra+Boys"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band's original members are Rachael Price (lead vocals), Mike ""McDuck"" Olson (trumpet, guitar), Bridget Kearney (upright bass), and Mike Calabrese (drums). Akie Bermiss (keyboards) joined the band on tour in 2017 and is on their 2018 album. Lake Street Dive started at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. The band was named after a street with many dive bars in Olson's hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota. 

After meeting as fellow students at the New England Conservatory in Boston, the band was hand picked by Minneapolis trumpet/guitar player Mike Olson and named after an actual neighborhood of seedy bars in his hometown. Vocalist Rachael Price came from outside Nashville, Tennessee, stand-up bassist Bridget Kearney was an Iowa native, while drummer Mike Calabrese called Philadelphia home. “I wasn’t only impressed with their musicianship,” says Olson, who acquired the nickname “McDuck” while at the conservatory for his reclusive ways. “They were also a lot of fun just to hang out with.

215,the snuts,166183,3694672,"The Snuts are a Scottish alternative rock band formed in 2015, originating from West Lothian, Scotland. They have performed across the United Kingdom and Ireland. The band consists of Jack Cochrane (vocals and guitar), Joe McGillveray (guitar), Callum '29' Wilson (bass) and Jordan 'Joko' Mackay (drums) and was formed when the members were in school.

Wilson, McGillveray and McKay went to primary school with each other and they met Cochrane at secondary school.

Wilson has said ""we’ve only ever really played music together so I can’t really imagine it any other way"". They have been influenced by the likes of the Libertines and Arctic Monkeys, and Scottish Ned culture growing up. They have also said that ""one of our biggest inspirations is not to sound exactly like everybody else"". Before going full time as a band, Cochrane was a joiner, Wilson was a slater/roofer, Mackay was a mechanic and McGillveray got qualifications to be a stonemason.

The band's debut single, the demo ""Glasgow"" was described as a 'stunning track with heaps of melody' and quickly lead to an ever since growing fanbase. After releasing several other demo singles in 2016, the Snuts released the self-produced EP The Matador in June 2017.

The Snuts released their first 'proper' single, ""Seasons"" in June 2018, described as 'conventional in a much-needed and refreshing way', a 'total throwback to the last renaissance of alternative music' and 'impeccably pieced together, designed to detonate on impact'. The following month, they then played at Scotland's TRNSMT Festival at the King Tut's Stage. In September, ""Manhattan Project"" was released, produced by Dave McCracken. In November 2018, the band signed with Parlophone Records. In March 2019, the band made their US debut at the South By South West festival in Austin, Texas, and their first single under Parlophone, ""All Your Friends"", was released in May. It was produced by Inflo and was the first single from their second EP Mixtape. It was described as having ""an irresistibly catchy raw edge and a massive chorus"" and Cochrane explained that it was a ""new twist on a familiar social stigma around the drug epidemic that nobody seems to want to talk about"".

In July 2019 they performed again at TRNSMT, this time on the Main Stage; in August they performed at the Reading and Leeds Festivals and also at Victorious Festival. The band's next single ""Maybe California"" was released in September 2019 and was produced by Rich Costey. ""Juan Belmonte"", named after the Spanish bullfighter, and also produced by Costey, was released in October. In January 2020, the Snuts released a cover of Bruno Mars' ""When I Was Your Man"" from sessions at the Firepit Recording Studios in London. Two further singles, ""Fatboy Slim"" (in ""homage of Fatboy Slim's notorious set at Brighton beach"" in 2002) and ""Coffee & Cigarettes"" were released before March, whereupon the EP Mixtape was released. The EP consists of 5 songs which showcase different influences and 4 interludes, which are studio outtakes, giving a kind of informal feel to the EP. The EP peaked at number 14 on the UK Albums Chart and also topped the Scottish Albums Chart, as well as the UK Vinyl Albums Chart. Following the success of Mixtape, the Snuts quickly released their next single, a cover of the Lovin' Spoonful's ""Summer in the City"". Like their previous cover song, this was a Firepit session. It was also featured in an advert for Strongbow cider in August 2020.

The following single ""Elephants"" was released in June 2020 and was produced by Tony Hoffer. It topped the iTunes Singles Chart on the day of its release. Cochrane described it as ""another twist on our ever-growing diverse catalogue"". In August, the band supported the Libertines at a socially-distanced performance at the Virgin Money Unity Arena in Newcastle. ""That's All It Is"" was released in September and features on the soundtrack to the video game FIFA 21. A week later, the Snuts released ""Always"", with Cochrane saying ""the song depicts the message of falling in love with someone who in turn allows you to love yourself"".""Always"" was the final number one single on the Scottish Singles Chart before it was discontinued in December 2020.

In December, the band announced the release of their debut album W.L. on 19 March 2021, later pushed back to 2 April. It includes 10 previously released singles, three of which featured on the EP Mixtape, and three previously unreleased songs. The deluxe edition also includes four previously unreleased bonus tracks. In February 2021, a new single, ""Somebody Loves You"" was released in support of the Scottish Refugee Council, with the band donating the budget for the music video to the charity. Before its release, the Snuts performed the album at Stirling Castle and it was later released as a live album. W.L. debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, making the Snuts the first Scottish band to do so with their debut album since The View in 2007.

Because of COVID-19 restrictions, the band were unable to go on tour until the end of July, whereupon they began a UK tour. In October, they briefly toured the US, before returning to the UK to continue their tour there. Between January and February 2022, the Snuts supported the Kooks as an opening act for their nationwide tour promoting their upcoming album 10 Tracks to Echo in the Dark. In June, they supported Louis Tomlinson along with Californian band Sun Room for a couple performances in Mexico. The Snuts opened for Tomlinson again in 2023 on the North America leg of his Faith in the Future World Tour. From 28 June to 1 July 2022, the Snuts were the opening act for Kings of Leon during the latter's When You See Yourself tour.

In July 2021, the Snuts announced that they had already written their second album. In November, the first single, ""Burn the Empire"", was released. Several other singles were released in 2022, including a collaboration with Rachel Chinouriri entitled ""End of the Road"", and their album Burn the Empire was announced in June 2022 and released on 7 October 2022. However, in early September, following an online campaign by the band to make Parlophone release the album earlier, the release date was brought forward to 30 September. Burn the Empire peaked at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart.

Following the release of Burn the Empire, the Snuts decided not to renew their contract with Parlophone. Instead, they decided to leave and set up their own label, Happy Artist Records, with distributor The Orchard. On leaving Parlophone, Cochrane said that ""throughout the last campaign it was clear our vision as artists and that of the label, had drifted apart significantly"" and that ""The Orchard felt like a safe home we could transition to smoothly. It was clear from the offset they understood the core values of The Snuts and the community that comes with us"". The first release on their new label came in May 2023 with ""Gloria"". In November, they announced their third album Millennials, released on 23 February 2024. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Snuts"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

221,mogwai,1561841,81254029,"Mogwai is a band from Glasgow, Scotland formed in 1995. They compose lengthy, mostly instrumental guitar-based pieces in the style of post-rock, usually focused around the elaboration of a single theme, and are known traditionally for their quiet/loud dynamic, defined bass riffs, and an eminent ambient sound, sometimes dark and sometimes grand. Although frequently referred to as post-rock, the band have revealed in interviews that they despise this categorization, insisting that their sound bears little resemblance to pioneers of the genre, such as Tortoise. 

The band were originally signed to renowned Glasgow indie label Chemikal Underground, but call a number of labels home, being distributed by different labels such as Matador in the United States and Play it again Sam Records in the United Kingdom. They have also developed their own label called Rock Action Records, named after guitarist Ron Asheton of The Stooges, who had his name changed to Rock Action.

Mogwai are named after the creatures from the film Gremlins (the word itself is Cantonese for 'ghost' or 'hunter' dependant on the semi or literal translation), although Braithwaite comments that ""it has no significant meaning and we always intended on getting a better one [name], but like a lot of other things we never got round to it."".

Their style has been influenced by such bands as The Cure, Joy Division, The Jesus & Mary Chain, Pixies, My Bloody Valentine, and post-rock granddaddies Slint. During 2004 the band were handed support slots on the tours of two of their heroes, the Pixies and The Cure. It has easily identifiable connections to genres like shoegaze, math rock, art rock, and occasionally instrumental metal. While Mogwai's sound bears little resemblance to punk rock, the band seems to identify closely with the punk ethic.

Mogwai's influence on the indie rock scene can be heard in the work of Explosions in the Sky, Italians Giardini di Mirò, Qatsi, and most other contemporary post-rock.

The fifth Mogwai album, Mr. Beast, was released in March 2006 and returned to the heavier sounds of 1997's Mogwai Young Team.  Mr. Beast saw Mogwai dropping most of their ""post-rock"" crescendoing with songs developing more like rock, with direct hooks and lyrics.

Mogwai produced the remix track of 'Plans' on the British group Bloc Party's 2005 album Silent Alarm Remixed.

In October 2006 Mogwai returned with a soundtrack to the documentary of global football star Zinedine Zidane called Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait,  released through their own label Rock Action. They have also released a soundtrack to Darren Aronofsky's 'The Fountain' in collaboration with Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet.

The Hawk is Howling was released in September 2008.

In February 2011 the band released their 7th Studio Album Hardcore Will Never Die, But You Will. And, in July 2013, Mogwai performed their soundtrack to Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait for the first time at a number of dates across the UK. Shortly afterwards, on 5 August, the band revealed via Twitter that they were recording a new studio album at Castle of Doom Studios, released in early 2014 called Rave Tapes.

Guitarist John Cummings left the band in 2015.

2016 saw the band take part in two soundtracks. Atomic was released in April for the documentary 'Atomic, Living in Dread and Promise', and was composed entirely by the band. They also contributed to Before the Flood (Music from the Motion Picture), which featured Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross and Gustavo Santaolalla.

In 2017, Mogwai released Every Country's Sun, their ninth studio album, which heralded a return to their earlier sound.

Mogwai appeared on another film soundtrack in 2018.   Helicon 1, from their 1997 album Ten Rapid, was featured on the original motion picture soundtrack of ‘Beautiful Boy’.
