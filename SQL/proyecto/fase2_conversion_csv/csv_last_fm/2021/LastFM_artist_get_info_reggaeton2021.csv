1. David Sánchez Badillo (nacido el 25 de septiembre de 1979 en Ponce, Puerto Rico) mejor conocido como Tempo, es un cantante de rap y reggaeton. Es uno de los artistas más influyentes del genero reggaetón y es considerado para muchos el rey del rap latino.

David Sánchez Badillo es uno de los raperos más activos en producciones musicales dentro del género del “rap”. La trayectoria musical de Tempo se categórico por sus criticas al gobierno, la policía, y temas de índole social.
Tempo se dio a conocer por sus letras y entrega al género. Sin embargo, se ganó el respeto de sus compañeros en la industria. Además, participó en diferentes producciones musicales con: Héctor & Tito, Wisin & Yandel, Mexicano 777, Baby Rasta & Gringo, y Getto & Gastam. En su álbum Game Over, realizó dúos con: MC Ceja y Maicol & Manuel. Su talento lo llevó a crear una canción con Elvis Crespo para la producción discográfica, Bandida.
Una de las características principales que dio paso a la figura de Tempo fue su “tiraera”. La realidad es que Tempo se ganó el reconocimiento y admiración de sus fanáticos con sus líricas controversiales. Sus contagiosas canciones lo llevaron a tener guerras líricales con raperos de la talla de Daddy Yankee, Lito, Master Joe, Nicky Jam, O.G Black, Polaco, entre otros. Aún así, David superó todo lo que a “tiraera” se refiere.
Tempo rompió récord de ventas en Puerto Rico, pues sus discos fueron exitosos. Fue el primer rapero en vender 50 mil copias con su producción, Game Over. También, por primera vez en la historia del “rap” vendió 100 mil copias con sus discos New Game y Los Éxitos. Tempo logró ser el primer rapero en obtener un jugoso contrato con Sony Music por más de 600 mil dólares.
Actualmente, Tempo se encuentra cumpliendo una condena de 24 años en una cárcel federal en Coleman, Florida. Aunque Tempo, no este en la libre comunidad sus fanáticos y seguidores lo mantienen vivo dentro del género. Hoy día su campaña “Free Tempo” ha crecido y sólo desean que el mejor rapero vuelva a revolucionar la industria con sus líricas y su contagioso ritmo musical.
tempo uno de los mejores cantantes de rap y reggaeton que mediante las liricas de sus canciones demuestra lo que siente al ser llevado a la prision.
Ya Es Conocido Como La Leyenda Del Hip Hop Tempo.

24,ryan castro,281921,5187415,"Ryan Castro es una de las nuevas caras del reggaetón y, aunque en sus videos juega con la clásica estética aspiracional de los carros de alta gama y las mansiones, su proyecto nació en el barrio Pedregal, al norte de Medellín. El colegio, las calles y los vecinos del sector pueden dar fe de cómo fue el comienzo de su historia.

Luego de salir del colegio, a los 16 años, se proyectó para hacer música a nivel profesional. Inspirado por las música y las películas que vio de 50 Cent, Eminem o Daddy Yankee, Ryan salió a buscar su primer público: los usuarios del transporte urbano.

“Empecé a cantar en los buses a los 17 años porque empecé a sentir la necesidad de hacer algo y ayudar a la familia. La experiencia fue muy bacana y enriquecedora porque me hizo ganar mucha confianza”, cuenta el paisa.

En los buses hacía covers de Kafu Banton, de Baroni One Time y una que otra composición original. Su segunda gran plataforma fueron las discotecas del Valle de Aburrá, donde también cantó sus propias canciones como Morena, que es un rap romántico, y Mi Styling, un dancehall.

Luego de tocar varias puertas y ver limitadas sus oportunidades tomó la decisión de irse del país para trabajar, ahorrar dinero e invertirlo en su proyecto. Llegó a Curazao y trabajó en hoteles y restaurantes. Cada peso que ganó lo usó para costear sus producciones y los videos musicales.

En Curazao grabó dos canciones y gracias al bendito internet logró que se sonaran en su natal Medallo. Muchos creyeron que Ryan era extranjero.

Esas canciones vincularon a Ryan con la compañía discográfica del caleño Kevin Roldán. Para 2021, su nombre estará dos veces en el nuevo álbum de Kevin Roldán y, además, lanzará su disco debut que lleva por nombre El Cantante Del Guetto, un homenaje a sus raíces y su barrio. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Castro"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

El mayor tiene solo 26 años y el menor 21. Son jóvenes, sí, pero ya son conscientes de su éxito y más que un grupo, ellos se consideran una familia, pues lo más importante, antes de cantar, es la unión y la lealtad a su amistad.

Todo comenzó en junio del año 2007 cuando se conocieron en un asado que organizó un amigo que tenían en común. Conversando se dieron cuenta de que los cuatro eran músicos y terminaron cantando hasta las 6 de la mañana.

Días después El Profe buscó a Dim y al Llanero y les propuso formar un grupo, pero Dim dijo que sí con la condición de que también incluyeran a Pablito, quien estaba de viaje en ese momento en Contadora, Panamá.

Fue tanta la emoción y la ansiedad por crear el grupo que inmediatamente llamaron a Pablito a Panamá y el aceptó sin dudarlo.

Paso a paso
Su segundo encuentro, o mejor dicho su primer ensayo, fue en el club house de un amigo del edificio San Mitchel, en el piso 21, desde donde se podía ver la ciudad d medellin completa. Este se convirtió durante varios meses en su ensayadero oficial y era allí donde pasaban noches enteras montando las canciones.

""Durante esas noches soñábamos con que algún día escucharían nuestras composiciones en todas esas casa que veíamos desde allá"", cuenta Dim.

""Y creo que lo estamos logrando, pero ahora la idea es que también nos escuchen en aquellas de las que solo veíamos la luz, arriba en las montañas"", continúa El Profe.

Su nombre
A la hora de pensar en cómo se llamarían, dieron muchas vueltas y hasta lo consultaron con sus familias y sus profesores.

Al principio le buscaron por el lado de sus iniciales o pensaron en jugar un poco con los nombres de David y Pablo, pero luego de intentarlo por muchos lados, se les ocurrió Piso 21, pues fue a esta altura donde realmente conformaron el grupo.

Pero a este nombre también le han encontrado una metáfora, pues según ellos, indica que para arriba es adonde quieren llegar, dando pasos lentos, pero seguros y muy largos.

Precisamente antes de empezar cada concierto, el grupo se reúne para gritar su frase favorita ""Piso 21, vamos pa'arriba papá"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Piso+21"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

44,natti natasha,305801,4348769,"Natalia Alexandra Gutiérrez, known by her stage name Natti Natasha, is a Dominican reggaeton singer, songwriter, and actress. Hailing from Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Natasha grew up surrounded by endless musical influences and enrolled in Santiago’s School of Fine Arts at the age of seven where she developed her singing abilities, describing her time at the school as “one of the best of her life.” Her studio experience would begin as a teenager when she would record songs as a hobby and later alongside friends.

This all led up to her decision to make the biggest and riskiest move of her life, and that was to move to the United States. She settled in the Bronx, New York, or “the City of the Dreams and Dreamers” for young, aspiring musicians like her at the time. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Natti called the move “one of the craziest moves anyone ever did in her family,” and that she often looks back at the decision and wonders what she was doing. Natti would hop from studio to studio, working without pay, but to her, this was a way to get her name out there. A producer friend from Santiago would soon step in and lend her his New York studio.

Natti’s first-ever break came when icon Don Omar signed her to his record label, the Orfanato Music Group, and the pair would go on to make history for years to come. Their collaborations “Dutty Love,” “Tus Movimientos,” “Perdido en tus Ojos,” and a “Hold Ya” remix with Gyptian made waves across Latin America and introduced the world to future reggaeton royalty. Her debut project, an EP titled “All About Me” was released on March 28, 2012.

Natti would continue to make big career moves throughout the years including her departure from Don Omar’s record label and signing onto Pina Records in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2017 when her big breakout would come once and for all. Not only did she record and release a collaboration titled “Otra Cosa” alongside the legendary Daddy Yankee, but she also released what was arguably the biggest song of 2017. “Criminal” featuring Ozuna became an instant hit upon its release, the music video amassing over 1 billion views in just five months and becoming the most watched music video by a female singer released that year.

2019 saw the release of her much-anticipated debut album, “ilumiNATTI,” on February 15. 15 tracks made up the project with two collaborations in total, “Te Lo Dije'' with Anitta and “Soy Mía” with Kany García. Standout track “La Mejor Version de Mi” would transform into a bachata hit with its remix featuring bachata king Romeo Santos.

Natti’s sophomore album titled “NATTIVIDAD” would be released two years later on September 24, 2021 with 17 tracks featuring several chart-topping collaborators such as Becky G, Maluma, and Prince Royce. The release was followed up by the six-episode docuseries titled “Everybody Loves Natti” which documented her pregnancy and relationship with fiancé Raphy Pina. The series premiered on November 19, 2021 on Amazon Prime Video and was generally well received. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Natti+Natasha"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The young duo, Mau y Ricky, sons of music icon Ricardo Montaner, have released the album's first single, ""Voy Que Quemo,"" a song they decided best represents the music that is coming out in the LP, expected to release in July. ""After writing so many songs, it just seemed natural to start recording an album,"" Ricky, 25, tells Billboard, speaking on behalf of the duo since Mau was on vocal rest. ""We have 10 songs and an 11th that is an instrumental track. 'Voy Que Quemo' seemed like the best song to release first, and we're feeling super excited and nervous.""

Mau y Ricky partnered with Latin Grammy winner Julio Reyes Copello to produce their album and credit him for allowing them to grow artistically and teach them about following their intuition. ""We've grown as producers and songwriters, thanks to him. We also learned that the intuition of an artist is so important and it's something that needs to be respected because your intuition will differentiate you from others. We learned to write for ourselves and put out songs that will represent who we are.""

And that's exactly what Mau y Ricky did. They followed their intuition after listening to their song ""Arte"" which was almost going to be pitched to Wisin, but Ricky says, ""It didn't feel right for another artist to sing this song.""

""We've written songs together, so working with him helps you grow a lot because he's a very hard critic. Every song I've written since I was 8 years old, I'd run it by him and he'd give me feedback.

Ayala was born in Río Piedras, the largest district of San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he became interested in music at a young age. In his youth he was interested in baseball, and aspired to become a Major League Baseball player.

He then became involved in the underground rap movement that was in its early stages in Puerto Rico, later to be called Reggaeton. After receiving lessons from several artists within the genre, he developed an independent career, first recording in a production titled Playero 37. After this he began to produce independent albums. His first solo album was No Mercy in 1995. He subsequently formed a duo with Nicky Jam, and then continued his solo career with the releases of El Cartel and El Cartel II. This led him be one of many pioneers of the reggaeton genre.

In 2002 El Cangri.com became Ayala's first album with international success, receiving coverage in the markets of New York and Miami. Barrio Fino was released in 2004, and the album received numerous awards, including a Premio Lo Nuestro and a Latin Billboard, as well as receiving nominations for the Latin Grammy and MTV Video Music Awards. Barrio Fino performed well in the sales charts of the United States, Latin America, Europe, and Japan. On June 5, 2007, El Cartel Records released El Cartel: The Big Boss, which was ranked as the top-selling album in Latin music genres in 2007. He promoted the album with an international tour which began in the United States and continued through Latin America, breaking attendance records in Ecuador and Bolivia. His performances have appeared on more than 70 albums, including compilations such as Mas Flow 2 and Blin Blin Vol. 1. Outside of his work as a musician, Ayala has also worked as an actor and producer. Throughout his career, he has been generally reticent to discuss his personal life, but has publicly expressed the importance of his wife and children to him. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Daddy+Yankee"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Cazzu es una artista de música urbana que se caracteriza por haber sido siempre muy voluble. Ha trabajado muchos estilos durante toda su carrera, pero encontró en el trap y el reguetón su verdadero lenguaje. El trap es por definición un compendio de géneros aglutinados, y Cazzu conoce perfectamente todos y cada uno de ellos.


La trapera estudió cine, y su conocimiento de la estética visual le ha ayudado mucho a la hora de conformar la suya propia. Su estilo es desinhibición en estado puro. Cargada de energía, para dar caña con cada tema.

Cazzu, con temas suaves que invitan a bailar y a moverse, es conocedora de todos esos géneros tan interesantes que conforman el trap argentino. Por ello, la trapera es sin duda una de las reinas del trap latino e internacional.

Se presentó en el panorama con su primer tema Killa. Una canción que sienta unas bases muy claras, una carta de presentación como mujer empoderada, llena de espíritu underground. La artista se ha ganado el respeto de todos los artistas de trap del panorama latino, llegando a colaborar con muchos de ellos.

Sus colaboracion con Bad Bunny, Duki y Khea en LOCA y LOCA REMIX es un himno del trap mundial.

72,dj nelson,78850,518299,"Nelson Díaz Martinez (born on April 7, 1972 in San Juan, Puerto Rico), known artistically as DJ Nelson is a DJ/producer who played a significant role in the development and popularization of reggaeton.[1] He first made a name for himself as part of the Noise, a club-centered collective that was spawned in 1992. The Noise—composed of DJs, MCs, producers, and club coordinators—hosted a long-lasting series of club nights in San Juan that were vital to the development and popularization of reggaeton. DJ Nelson earned credit as one of the top Noise DJs, and he also served as a producer/arranger for the collective's music.

In 1997 he made his CD debut, Nel-Zone, which was split into respective reggae and rap mixes, and he also was credited on a couple other CD releases that year: Don Chezina's Bien Guillao de Gangster and Ivy Queen's En Mi Imperio (1997). From this point forward, DJ Nelson began focusing on his solo career, primarily as a producer, with notable credits including Ivy Queen's The Original Rude Girl (1998) and Wisin & Yandel's Los Reyes del Nuevo Milenio (2000). His mixtape-style productions continued as well, with Undertrack Collection (2000) and Music (2001), the latter of which marked the advent of his personal brand, Flow Music.
DJ Nelson signed to this label a trio of young, up-and-coming producers: Francisco Saldaña, Víctor Cabrera, Norgie Noriega, the former two of whom are better known as Luny Tunes, of course, while the latter goes by just Noriega. These three producers pooled their talents together for Mas Flow (2003), a mixtape album that was groundbreaking in terms of popularity and influence. Numerous volumes followed, except without Noriega, who went the solo route, debuting with Contra la Corriente (2004). DJ Nelson continued with his own career as well, releasing Flow la Discoteka (2004) and opening a club of the same name, at which he was the resident DJ. In addition, he is credited with having set up The Mix 107.7, a popular Puerto Rican radio station hosted by DJ Coyote, and he even took his brand into the clothing industry, forming Flow Wear. Released in 2007, Flow la Discoteka, Vol. 2 featured his biggest hit single to date, ""Pasarela"", performed by Dalmata. DJ Nelson, Gerardo Cruet and Arcangel, consider themselves as pioneers in the new ""urban movement"", a sub-genre of reggaeton and hip-hop, Electro-Flow. Electro-Flow as Arcangel baptized it, is a blend of Hip-hop, reggaeton, dance-hall, electronica, and other futuristic sounds. Electro-flow can be heard in the songs. ""Chica Virtual"", ""Pa Que la Pases Bien"", ""Te Estoy Buscando"". ""Sexy Movimiento"", ""Siguelo"", ""Dame un Poquito"" by Wisin y Yandel. ""Veo Veo"" by Yaga y Mackie Ranks. Also ""Let's Do It"" ""No te Veo"" all are considered Electro-flow. Some songs lean more towards dance Hip Hop while some lean more towards Reggaeton depending on the song. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Nelson"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He is one of the most well known reggaeton artists in Latin America. His cross over success in the U.S. has given him more exposure to English speaking Reggaeton fans, making him one of the more recognizable faces of Reggaeton along with Daddy Yankee and Tego Calderón. Don Omar's popularity is currently rising and he recently appeared on MTV. Omar is best known for his songs ""Dile"" and ""Dale Don Dale"" from his first album The Last Don and ""Reggaeton Latino"". His songs center around life and love; some examples of these would be ""La Recompenza"" (The Reward), ""Pobre Diabla"" (Poor Devil (fem.)) and ""Aunque te Fuiste"" (Even Though You Left).

His debut album, The Last Don, sold over 350,000 units in South America. Both ""The Last Don"" as the live edition of it have been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Worldwide, The Last Don: Live [CD & DVD] sold over one million copies, according to the official website. His debut single, ""Dale Don Dale"", sold over 100,000 copies in South America. He received the awards for ""Latin Pop Album of the Year"" and ""New Artist & Latin Rap/Hip-Hop Album of the Year"" by the Billboard Latin Music Awards in 2003. The Last Don: Live [CD & DVD] was also nominated for ""Urban Music Album"" at the 2005 Latin Grammy Awards

He started his career after facing many obstacles when Héctor Delgado (from the duo Héctor y Tito) gave him an opportunity to be a backup singer. After that, he sang in a live concert with Héctor and Tito in 2003, which was released later as a CD and DVD, which included the songs that became instant hits, Baila Morena and Amor de Colegio.

In 2005, Don Omar released the reggaeton album ""Da Hitman Presents Reggaeton Latino"", which broke the record for ""Highest First Week Sales for a Reggaeton Album"" by selling over 31,000 units in its first week, resulting a debut of #61 in The Billboard 200. Wisin y Yandel held that record until ""Reggaeton Latino"" was released.

The first single released from Reggaeton Latino, ""Dale Don Dale [Remix]"" , which features rapper Fabolous, debuted at #1 on the crossover chart.

He is currently signed to VI Music through Universal Music Latino.

In early 2006, the Governor of Puerto Rico, Aníbal Acevedo Vilá publicly mentioned interest in having Don Omar participate in a program against School Desertion. However, the Secretary of Education has rejected Don Omar sponsoring it due to his lyrics. The local press has also mentioned that Omar himself did not finish High School.

Currently has his own record label ""El Orfanato"" (The Orphanage) and had a magnificent performance in the 2011 Latin Music Billboard Awards where he received the Award for Latin Rythm Airplay. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Don+Omar"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Con su padre fue siguiendo el mismo paso de la música tempranamente a los 12 años, en los tiempos libres se dedicaba a la vocalización y al piano.

Su padre lo inclinó por la música aunque el escogió el género urbano. Su primer sencillo contó con el apoyo de su amigo Pipe Calderon y su productor Dj Cano quienes realizaron ""En Busca De Ella"".

Se dio a conocer tanto a nivel nacional como internacional con el éxito ""Te Pintaron Pajaritos"" junto a Yandar & Yostin, ​ superando las 100 millones de visitas en YouTube. ​ Teniendo éxito en países como Argentina, Chile, España contando con el apoyo de Juan Magan, Ecuador, Venezuela, Perú y por supuesto Colombia.

Luego de tanto éxito con ""Te Pintaron Pajaritos"" siguió su carrera con ""Por Todo Me Peleas"" ​ una canción muy bien acogida pero sin dudar no tuvo tanto éxito como la anterior, grabó una versión 'remix' con Riko ""El Monumental"", siguió creciendo su carrera lanzando ""Si Me Necesitas"" una canción que no sonó mucho, pero luego cuando grabó el remix con Baby Rasta & Gringo fue todo un éxito. ​

Hizo un salto cuando estrenó dos canciones junto a dos buenos exponentes del género urbano, los puertorriqueños Nicky Jam y Dálmata, primero Los Perros Se Enamoran fue escuchada en una buena parte de país ​ y Espina de Rosa la cual fue mucho más exitosa en todo el país teniendo cerca de 40 millones de reproducciones en YouTube y ocupando los primeros puestos del género urbano en Paraguay, Chile, Ecuador y Colombia. De la mano de Universal Music Spain entró con fuerza a España. ​

Para el 2014 no tuvo éxito en canciones suyas, pero sí ocupó los primeros puesto con canciones como ""Salgamos"" junto a Kevin Roldán y Maluma, a pesar de estrenar ""Hollywood"". Para finales del 2014 estrenó El Que la Hace la Paga junto a su padre Jhonny Rivera ​ y tiene en los primeros lugares ""Mañana"" al lado de la mayor exponente urbana de Colombia Karol G.

En 2015 el tema ""Será lo mejor"" en Colombia ya forma parte del Top Latin Songs de Monitor Latino donde ha escalado de posición durante las dos semanas que lleva presente. ​ El 11 de agosto lanzaría el remix de No Hay Razón Para Odiarte en colaboración a Yelsid y ""El rey del despecho"" Dario Gómez.
