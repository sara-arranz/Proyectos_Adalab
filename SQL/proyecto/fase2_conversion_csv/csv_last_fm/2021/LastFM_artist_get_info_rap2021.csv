2,cano,22232,482073,"CANO is a Franco-Ontarian folk-pop collective which was active from 1975 until 1985. While Wikipedia claims that CANO was ""progressive"", the band itself describes its style as a mix of folk, rock, and jazz (see www.canomusique.com).

The name comes from the Coopérative des artistes du Nouvel Ontario (CANO), an agricultural and artistic commune established in Sudbury, Ontario.

On stage, CANO was able to produce a level of intensity only comparable to a symphonic orchestra. They did not only produce the most European music in America in their era (which may have hurt their success chances in the U.S.), they did so while bridging the tremendous cultural gap between French and English Canada by including members from both parts and singing in both languages.

Members of the band are singer André Paiement (died in 1978), violinist Wasyl Kohut (died in 1981), guitarists Marcel Aymar and David Burt, bassist John Doerr, pianist Michel Kendel, and drummer Michel Dasti.

1) Miguel Duran:
Hearing the sounds of his father's instrumental harmonies and melodic tunes before his birth would only make it natural for Miguel Duran to bear the innate ability to follow in his own father's footsteps as a musician. On September 24th, 1981 in Washington DC, Miguel Duran was born. His father would make it a point to teach Miguel everything he knew about music. He knew it wouldn't be an easy task to raise a kid in a cruel harsh world, but he had faith that music would show him the right path.
Listening to the cling and the clatter of the timbales in salsa and Merengue on a vinyl LP in his living room, is where Miguel would learn who great singers such as Frankie Ruiz, Juan Luis Guerra, Hector Lavo, and others were that had a tremendous impact in his own culture, in Latin music. Outside of his home, Miguel would be known as Fuego. On the streets speakers would fill the air with strong beats and rattle the houses with bass sounds showing a thunderous demonstration of love for hip-hop and rap. He'd learn who Biggie Smalls, Tu-Pac, Bone Thugs, and Big Pun were. He'd listen intensely to their style and the way they would flow with their unforgettable rhymes and cherished hooks. The street was his classroom, and his main subject was hip-hop. Within those two worlds is where Fuego would look within himself and make his distinctive style of music.
In 1998 he formed part of a group called 3MEN2 (Tremendo). The group tried very hard to work together and to take their music to the public. However, times were difficult. Each member had to think about how they were going to sustain themselves before following their true passion, music. Unfortunately, everyone decided to go separate ways. Nevertheless, Fuego didn't let that become a reason to give up. He knew that music was his calling. He began to write song after song and tried to get onto as many recordings around his way. He was then given the chance to perform solo. 
In a college auditorium he had to prove to the audience that he was meant to be a star. On stage he began to astonish his audience, with his mesmerizing lyrics and his incredible hooks. The girls started to chant Fuego's name, and music became his enlightenment. Fuego also discovered that his key to his music would be to romanticize his female audience. Music had become his motivation, his fuel. 
Along his path he met DJ Menace. DJ Menace knew that Fuego had potential and the drive to make it in the music industry. He began to help him gain exposure in the area. Menace would book him on local radio stations and shows around Maryland and DC. Menace didn't just introduce Reggaeton to DC and Maryland but he also introduced Fuego to the area. Fuego began to gain recognition in the area by performing every week. With the help from DJ Menace he was getting the practice he needed to one day perform nationwide. Sadly, DJ Menace was involved in a fatal car accident in 2003. Fuego was struck by the news but was given another reason to keep performing. His luck would soon change with his encounter of a very well known duo in the Reggaeton genre, in which would help Fuego's path in his musical career. 
One evening in one of Fuego's performances, a member of Plan B watched his show. Fuego's undeniable talent amazed Chencho. Chencho knew he had to work with him and introduced him to Boy Wonder a well-known producer in the genre. . Boy Wonder was also highly impressed with his exceptional style, and was convinced Fuego could take the genre to the next step. Fuego felt that he was in the right hands and was able to record his track ""Me Gustan Todas"" featured on ""EL Draft O5"". The track became one of the top five singles of the album. Without hesitation Fuego made a decision to sign with Chosen Few Emerald Entertainment. 
Since then Fuego's been able to do collaborations with some of the heavy weights in Reggaeton and Latin Hip-hop. He's been featured in albums such as El Draft 2005, Bob Marley, and Chosen Few El Documental II. Boy Wonder can best describe him as ""Young, fresh, and multi-creative with a dynamic style of singing, rapping, and flowin. He is and will be like the title of his album ""Untouchable"". Fuego currently is working on his own album, which will be released in 2007. He will also featured on LDA, Reychesta, and Getto's albums, and more of Chosen Few productions. He believes that his purpose is ""Bringing something different to the table. Creating different and innovative sounds. Wanting to really blow up the genre, and bring out the soul in Latin hip hop.""

2) Paul Surugiu:
Fuego is not a traditional Christmas artist, but he does a good job, in my opinion singing carols on winter time. His voice is suited for this style and he has some beautiful carols. He is a pop singer, with folkloric experiences. I could not put my finger on his exact musical style and I don’t even bother to, I just listen…

Ignacio (head of the record label MAGIA) devotes himself to “La Caja” – an old machine for calibrating equipment that he uses to get us into underwater sounds, bubbly atmospheres and melancholic mermaid calls through highly emotional and trance-inducing tunes. His solo orchestral project Fuego has been active in different line-ups (from solo or duo up to quintet) since 2011.

11,drake,5929297,831656803,"Aubrey ""Drake"" Graham (born October 24, 1986) is an Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and businessman. Drake was an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s. Intent on pursuing a career in music, he left the series in 2007 after releasing his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.

Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum. His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same, were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late and collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of which earned platinum certification in the U.S. His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records. The dancehall-influenced album sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over 10 years. The album's second single, ""One Dance"", topped the charts in several countries, and became his first number-one single as a lead artist. That year, Drake led both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts simultaneously for eight weeks.

Views achieved quadruple platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. It became Drake's best-selling album to date. Its lead single ""Hotline Bling"" peaked at number two on the Hot 100 and received Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song, as well as ""One Dance"" which was proclaimed the song of the summer in 2016. In 2017, he released the ""playlist"" More Life. It became his seventh consecutive number one on the Billboard 200, and set multiple streaming records. A year later, he released the double album Scorpion, which also broke several streaming records, and contains the Grammy Award winning number-one single ""God's Plan"", and the bounce-infused number one singles ""Nice for What"" and ""In My Feelings"".

Among the world's best-selling music artists, with over 170 million records sold worldwide, he is ranked by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) as the world's highest-certified digital singles artist. Drake holds several Billboard chart records. He has the most charted songs (205) among solo artists in the history of the Billboard Hot 100, the most simultaneously charted Hot 100 songs in a single week (27), the most time on the Hot 100 (431 weeks) and the most Hot 100 debuts in a week (22). He also has the most number one singles on the Hot Rap Songs, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay and Rhythmic Charts. Drake has also won four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, twenty-seven Billboard Music Awards and three Juno Awards. As an entrepreneur, Drake has founded the OVO Sound record label with longtime collaborator 40 in 2012.

Early life
Drake attended both Forest Hill Collegiate Institute (left) and Vaughan Road Academy (right) during high school.
Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practicing Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Drake's mother, Sandra ""Sandi"" Graham (née Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. His parents met after Dennis performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he first interacted with Sandra, who was in attendance. He is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day school, and formally celebrated becoming a Bar Mitzvah in a religious service.

Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Dennis' limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the United States until Drake's early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, however, Dennis would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer. His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song titled ""Drake's Dad"". Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell records, which Drake vehemently denies.

Drake was raised in two Toronto neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end until grade six, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighborhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move, Drake replied, ""[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement; my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.""

He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school. He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighborhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighborhood, Drake described the school as ""not by any means the easiest school to go to."" Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background, and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school. He later graduated in October 2012.

Career - 2001–2005: Degrassi: The Next Generation
At 15, eager to begin as an actor, a high school friend introduced Drake to his father, who was an acting agent. The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks a basketball star who became physically disabled after a classmate shot him. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, ""My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV"". He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, returning for sporadic appearances until his character graduated from school. Overall, Drake appeared in a total of 145 episodes.

2006–2009: Early mixtapes and So Far Gone
Lil Wayne, the founder of Young Money Entertainment, would sign Drake to the label in 2009.
After becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as ""pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it."" The mixtape was released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies. In 2007, he released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single ""Replacement Girl"", featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever-unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with ""Replacement Girl"" being featured on the channel's ""New Joint of the Day"" segment on April 30, 2007. The song also saw Drake sample ""Man of the Year"" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including ""Ransom"", ""Forever"", and a remix to ""Brand New"". Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.

In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles ""Best I Ever Had"" and ""Successful"", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs ""I'm Goin' In"" and ""Fear"". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.

Due to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as ""one of the biggest bidding wars ever"". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album titled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means.

Drake then joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of ""Best I Ever Had"" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He underwent surgery later that year.

2010–2012: Thank Me Later and Take Care
Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.

On March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single ""Over"", which peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, ""Find Your Love"", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[76] The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, ""]Care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image]."" The third single and fourth singles, ""Miss Me"" and ""Fancy"" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.

Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.

It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire on May 8, and he had also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.

Beginning his second effort in fall 2010, Drake announced his intentions to allow for Noah ""40"" Shebib to handle most of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me Later, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and others. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be Take Care. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, ""I didn't get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed many of the songs and sonically I didn't get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round."" Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.

In January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie, to focus on the album. ""Dreams Money Can Buy"" and ""Marvins Room"" were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track listing, while ""Marvins Room"" gained Gold certification by the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio. Drake would soon release the song's music video on June 28.

""Headlines"" was released on August 9, acting as the lead single for Take Care. It was met with positive critical and commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12. It was eventually certified Platinum in both the United States and Canada. The music video for the single was released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game in January 2012. ""Make Me Proud"" was released as the album's second single, on October 16. It was the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number nine the following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88. ""Make Me Proud"" soon became Drake's fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.

Prior to the album's release, Drake had planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne, however, it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne. He had also begun collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled Y.O.L.O., but the duo decided against the project, in favor of increased concern for their respective studio albums.

Take Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. John McDonnell of NME dubbed it ""an affecting masterpiece"" and commended its ""delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive lyrics."" Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal found Drake's ""technical abilities"" to be improved and stated, ""Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up."" Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice called it ""a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West."" Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented the depth of Drake's ""moral psychodramas"" and stated, ""the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying power."" It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial success, eventually being certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the US.

The album's third and fourth singles, ""The Motto"" and Take Care"", were released on November 29, and February 21, 2012 respectively. Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with ""The Motto"" credited for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States. The music video for ""Take Care"" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, ""None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] - make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it."" The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year. The song was also featured on the channel's ""Pop Songs You Must Hear"" list of 2011. ""HYFR"" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified Gold. It would later win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video in 2012, and the channel also ranked him at number two on their ""Hottest MCs in the Game"" list.

In promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip-hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million. He then returned to acting, starring in Ice Age: Continental Drift as Ethan.

2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and commercial mixtapes
During the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer's influence over his next album. Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics prevalent previously.

In January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off of his third album at the conclusion of the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of his third album. The album's second single, ""Hold On, We're Going Home"", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful single off of the album, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song's music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the video. Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing the album's third single, ""Too Much"", alongside featured artist Sampha.

Nothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favorable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in 808s & Heartbreak. The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further promoted by the ""Would You like a Tour?"" throughout late 2013, to early 2014. It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million. Drake then returned to acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night Live, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what ""kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters"". Drake also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city. In late 2014, Drake announced that he had begun recording sessions for his fourth studio album.

In 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the Romeo Santos song Odio. He also appeared on a remix of Tuesday by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard's Rhythmic chart and number twelve on the ""Hot 100"", and released ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"" as a non-album single. The latter went double platinum in the United States.

On February 12, 2015, Drake released If You're Reading This It's Too Late onto iTunes, with no prior announcement. Despite debate on whether it is an album or a mixtape, its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money Records, a scheme that was rumored to allow Drake to leave the label. However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and If You're Reading This It's Too Late sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall. Drake proceeded If You're Reading This It's Too Late with a collaborative mixtape with Future, which was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week.

What a Time to Be Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Drake the first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the same year since 2004. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units. Drake also appeared on the cover of The Fader for their 100th issue.

2016–2017: Views and More Life
Drake announced in January 2016 that his fourth studio album would be launched during the spring, releasing the promotional single ""Summer Sixteen"" later that month. The album was originally titled Views from the six, but would later be shortened to Views. ""Summer Sixteen"" debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip-hop to more tenured artists. This move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as ""goodly brash"" or ""conventionally disrespectful."" It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake popularizing the term ""The Six"" when referencing Toronto. Drake also crashed a Bat Mitzvah in New York City on February 20, performing at the event.

Drake soon released the album's lead singles, ""Pop Style"" and the dancehall-infused ""One Dance"", on April 5. Both debuted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with ""One Dance"" becoming Drake's first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist. The single also became Drake's first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed the album's release date of April 29, and followed it up with various promotional videos. On October 15, ""One Dance"" became Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016.

Views was previewed in London, before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being made available to various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later to release a short film titled Please Forgive Me, starring frequent collaborators, Swedish twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta. As of 2019, Views remains Drake's best-selling album.

Drake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as the show's musical guest. Later, Drake was named as a member of the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury. During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the music video for ""Child's Play"" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics. On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views. At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Drake received the most nominations, with 10, winning the awards for Album of the Year and Best Hip-Hop Video. Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the course of the tour in Europe. Seven additional dates were added a day later due to overwhelming demands.

Soon after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed he would be releasing a project titled More Life in December, however he later pushed the date back to the new year. The project was described as a ""playlist of original music"", rather than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album. He was later revealed to be Spotify's most streamed artist for the second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion streams for all projects on the service, which is more than double the amount of streams he had in 2015. Drake later secured his second and third Grammy Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony. Despite multiple setbacks, Drake announced More Life would be released on March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials released through Instagram. Upon release, More Life received mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200, earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It also set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever streamed album in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music alone. The album also garnered 61.3 million streams on Spotify, dethroning Ed Sheeran's ÷ as the highest opening on the service in a single day. He later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins in a single show. Billboard also reported Drake had been present on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has the most recorded entries by a solo artist.

He then released the single ""Signs"" on June 24, as well as reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset. The singles marked his first releases since More Life, with ""Signs"" was initially released as a collaboration between Drake and French fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the ""Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2018"" fashion show. The event also had a playlist exclusively from OVO Sound, curated by label co-founder Oliver El-Khatib. Drake later hosted the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of Virginia Black. Drake then appeared in The Carter Effect documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince Carter, who was the first superstar player to appear for the Toronto Raptors since the franchise's inception in 1995. The documentary also featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and LeBron James.

2018: Scorpion and return to television
After rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer Pi'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017. Two songs would later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on January 20, 2018, marking Drake's first solo release since More Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring on a remix of the Jay-Z song ""Family Feud"" with Lil Wayne, as the lead single of the latter's Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape. Scary Hours featured the songs ""Diplomatic Immunity"" and ""God's Plan"", which both debuted within the top-ten, with the latter eventually breaking various streaming records as it debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was Drake's second as a solo artist to reach number one.

Drake earned his 70th top 40 hit after featuring on the Migos song ""Walk It Talk It"", which debuted at number eighteen, and peaked at number ten. He later featured on BlocBoy JB's debut single, ""Look Alive"", which was released on February 9, 2018. The song's entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper with the top 10 hits on the Hot 100, with 23. He then featured on a remix to ""Lemon"", a song originally released as collaboration between band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, Drake announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was releasing a single later that night. On April 6, ""Nice for What"" was released, alongside a music video, which featured several female celebrities.

After ""Nice For What"" replaced his own ""God's Plan"" on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace their former number-one debut, Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion, with a planned release date of June 29, 2018. He then released ""I'm Upset"" on May 26, as the album's third single. Scorpion was then released as a double-album, and marked Drake's longest project, with a run-time of just under 90 minutes. The album broke both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it gained 132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming service, respectively. It eventually sold 749,000 album equivalent units in its first week of sales, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.

Shortly thereafter, Drake collaborated with British hip hop promotion Link Up TV on July 7, releasing a freestyle as a part of the promotion's 'Behind Barz' segment, before releasing another freestyle a week later after featuring on Charlie Sloth's long-running Fire in the Booth program on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Drake then earned his sixth number-one hit with ""In My Feelings"" on July 21, which also spawned the viral ""#InMyFeelingsChallenge"" or ""#KiKiChallenge"". The success of ""In My Feelings"" also made Drake the record holder for most number one hits among rappers. Soon after, he released the music video for ""Nonstop"", which was filmed in London during his surprise performance at the Wireless Festival.

He then appeared on the album Astroworld, featuring uncredited vocals for the song ""Sicko Mode"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Drake announced in July 2018 that he planned to ""take 6 months to a year"" to himself in order to produce television and films, including Euphoria. He then began the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour with co-headliners Migos on August 12. This preceded collaboration with Bad Bunny titled ""Mia"", which featured Drake performing in Spanish. He later received the award for Hot Ticket Performer at the 2018 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 16. During a performance in Edmonton on November 7, Drake announced his intention to begin composing his next project in early 2019.

2019–present: Upcoming album
In February 2019, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rap Song, for ""God's Plan"", at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. During his speech, producers abruptly cut to a commercial break, leading viewers to speculate they were censoring his speech during which he criticized The Recording Academy. A legal representative for the Academy then released a statement stating ""a natural pause [led] the producers [to] assume that he was done and cut to commercial,"" and added the organization offered him an opportunity to return to stage, but he declined.

On February 14, Drake re-released his third mixtape, So Far Gone, onto streaming services for the first time to commemorate its 10-year anniversary, and later collaborated with Summer Walker on a remix of Walker's song ""Girls Need Love"", marking his first release of 2019. On April 10, 2019 during a London performance on his Assassination Vacation Tour, the OVO leader told the crowd he was working on his new album before the show. On June 8, Drake appeared on Chris Brown's single ""No Guidance"". On June 15, Drake released two songs, ""Omertà"" and ""Money in the Grave"", on his EP The Best in the World Pack to celebrate the NBA Championship win of the Toronto Raptors. On August 2, he released the compilation album Care Package, consisting of songs released between 2010 and 2016 that were initially unavailable for purchase or commercial streaming; it debuted at number one.

Artistry - influences
Drake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West, Jay Z, and Lil Wayne, while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah, and Usher. Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his ""biggest inspirations"".

Musical style
Drake has credited Kanye West (left) and Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical influences. Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism. His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as ""ting"", ""touching road"", ""talkin' boasy"" and ""gwanin' wassy"". Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip-hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing. He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.

The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional or boastful. However, Drake is often revered for incorporating ""degrading"" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between ""pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata."" Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as ""hyper-reality rap"", which is characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as being distinct from the ""real world.""

Public image
The Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States, with his single, ""The Motto"", which includes, ""You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO."" Drake later popularized the term ""The Six"" in 2015 in relation his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city. Furthermore, the subject matter of his artistry often revolving around relationships, have had widespread impact on social media through photo captions commonly used to reference emotions or personal situations. However, his lyrical contents have had a negative reception from fans and critics deeming him as sensitive; a trait that is understood as being antithetical to hip hop culture. June 10 was declared ""Drake Day"" in Houston, Texas. In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines, in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance. In 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States. He would also donate $200,000 in order to aid relief efforts in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey. In February 2018, following the single ""God's Plan"" debut at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Drake donated $50,000 to a Miami homeless shelter and giving a University of Miami student $50,000 to help with her tuition. Drake then ""kept up the spending spree"" by donating the rest of the song's video budget, $996,631.90, to several charitable causes and regular people across Miami.

The music video for ""Hotline Bling"" went viral, due to Drake's eccentric choices in dancing. The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake's unconventional nature on the song, causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, spawning several parodies. Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exampled by the video for ""Hotline Bling"". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6"" Classic Boots. This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose, in which various items of clothing were produced. Drake had also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the ""Air Jordan OVOs"". Moreover, his style and dress sense have caused GQ magazine to describe him as ""[one of] the most stylish men alive"".

Controversies - legal issues
In 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on ""Marvins Room"". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties. Despite Drake's legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling ""Jimmy Smith Rap"", a 1982 single by jazz musician, Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who stated Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on ""Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2"", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop. Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement. Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics on when collaborating with YG on the song ""Who Do You Love?"". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year. In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.

In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel ""Chubbs"" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also says the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering. The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu, after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference; the judge ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense.

Feuds
Drake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident and released a song criticizing Drake weeks later. Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute.

In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe magazine. Drake would later respond on ""6 God"" and ""6PM in New York"", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment.

Further controversy arose in July 2015, when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during recording sessions for ""RICO"", one of the lead singles off of Mill's second studio album. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller. Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for ""R.I.C.O."". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for ""R.I.C.O."", ""10 Bands"", and ""Know Yourself"". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, titled ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back"", in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with ""Wanna Know"", before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later. Despite subliminal disses from either artist, the feud has not been officially reignited. Drake would further seek to denounce Funkmaster Flex during his Madison Square Garden shows on the Summer Sixteen Tour. Following Meek Mill's sentencing of two to four years for probation violation, Drake stated ""Free Meek Mill"" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on ""Family Feud"". Pusha T would also use the same rationale to criticize Drake on ""Infrared"" in 2018, prompting Drake to respond with the ""Duppy Freestyle"" diss track on May 25. Pusha T would directly respond to the track through ""The Story of Adidon"" on May 29, which presented several claims, including an accusation of Drake fathering a secret child. The pair is considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, with Drake yet to respond to ""The Story of Adidon"".

In 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through ""4PM in Calabasas"", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on ""No Shopping"" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song. However, French Montana claimed that Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake, he has yet to officially respond to Budden. In the same year, Drake mocked Kid Cudi for his mental health, drug use and suicidal urges on ""Two Birds, One Stone"" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter. Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.

In mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator, Kanye West. In an appearance on the talk show The Shop in October, Drake recounted several business meetings with West, who voiced his desire to ""be Quincy Jones"" and work with him, in order to replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson. West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, which was agreed to as Drake ""felt a genuine vibe"" from West, and after West gifted him the beat to ""Lift Yourself"", which inspired Drake to begin writing to the instrumental. West then requested Drake to travel to Wyoming to continue working, and arrived a day after close friend 40. 40 said West was working on an album; contradictory to his previous aim of just wanting to ""give [Drake] beats"". Drake responded by saying West stated he would release in late 2018, and they should continue on. However, upon his arrival in Wyoming, Drake ""[spent] the majority of time working on [West's] music"", only exploring his own after playing the producer the song ""March 14"", which addresses Drake's relationship with his newborn son and co-parent. This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T. West would also release ""Lift Yourself"", and produce ""Infrared""; actions that greatly displeased Drake. This prompted him to denounce West in several songs and live performances. West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018.

Drake has purported to have been in reported feuds with DMX, Kendrick Lamar, Common, The Weeknd, XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez, and Ludacris, although the latter three have been reported to be resolved.

Business ventures - Endorsements
Prior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient. In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger King and Whataburger. Business magazine Forbes commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships ""combined heavily"" for Drake's reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the highest-paid celebrities during that period.

Main article: OVO Sound
During the composition of Nothing Was the Same, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, and business partner, Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the trio to team up to form OVO Sound. The name is an abbreviation derived from the October's Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects. Warner Bros. Records currently distribute the label.

Drake, 40 and PartyNextDoor were the label's inaugural artists. The label houses artists including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, OB O'Brien, Roy Woods, dvsn, Plaza, and Kash Doll, as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Mike Zombie, Nineteen85, and Future the Prince. OVO Sound has released six albums, with two certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Toronto Raptors
On September 30, 2013, at a press conference with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke, Drake was announced as the new ""global ambassador"" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. This would also be the setting where Drake was given The Key to the City. In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities, beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary. He began by hosting an annual ""Drake Night"" segment with the organization, which began in 2013.

Apple Music
Following the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million. This saw all future solo releases by Drake becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers. Drake had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted More Life. Drake's partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform's sharp success, as it attained 10 million subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists, such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services. Through signing with the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before the smartwatch saw public release.

Virginia Black
Two months prior to the release of Views, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based whiskey. This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring's Restaurant in Toronto. The beverage was created and also distributed alongside Proximo Spirits, as well as with Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008. The company described the partnership as ""fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey.""

The product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically. The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music and various tours, such as being part of the ""Virginia Black VIP Lounge"" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016. The company later aired commercials with Dennis Graham, which featured the tagline of ""The Realest Dude Ever"" (in reference toward ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to various European countries in 2017.

Personal life
Drake lives in Hidden Hills, California, since 2012. He also owns a property in Toronto, which was built from the ground-up in 2017, and a Toronto condo adjacent to the CN Tower. He owns a Boeing 767 airplane.

Drake's paternal uncles are bass guitarist Larry Graham and musician Teenie Hodges. Graham achieved both critical and commercial success as a member of the band Sly and the Family Stone, while Hodges featured as the lead guitarist and songwriter for Al Green, and contributed heavily on much of his work in the 1970s, including the hits ""Take Me to the River"", ""Love and Happiness"", and ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"".

Drake is a father to one son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French artist Sophie Brussaux. Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumors after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017; Drake eventually confirmed his fatherhood on the album Scorpion in 2018.

Drake dated singer Rihanna off-and-on from 2009 to 2016. He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums, and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said ""she's a woman I've been in love with since I was 22 years old."" On becoming a single parent, he mused on the talk show The Shop:

As life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don't have the fairy tale, like, 'Oh, Drake started a family with Rihanna and this is like so perfect.' It looks so good on paper. By the way, I wanted that too at one time.

He received his first record deal through producer D. A. Doman. 24kGoldn got his big break through his 2019 ""high-energy"" single ""Valentino"". However, the rapper said in 2020 that ""those ['Valentino'] were recorded over a year ago and don't exactly reflect the person I have become since then"". Golden released his debut EP Dropped Outta College in November 2019, and he signed a record deal with Records, LLC and Columbia Records. In 2020, Golden gained further attention with single ""City of Angels"", which was officially released to US alternative radio on March 31, 2020; followed up in May 2020 with an official remix of the song by English singer-songwriter Yungblud.

He initially took a leave of absence from school to pursue his rap career. Golden stated that he was not anticipating ""that things were going to happen so fast when I came to USC"", and did not think he would finish University, but he wanted to round off the school year to further develop the relationships he made, stating his love for being on campus, and that being a student kept him ""grounded"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/24kgoldn"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

20,kaze,32253,921397,"There are several artists named Kaze:

1. A Free Jazz Group
2. A Japanese R&B pop vocalist
3. Kevin “Kaze” Thomas
4. A Spanish rapper

1. 
Natsuki Tamura – trumpet
Christian Pruvost - trumpet
Satoko Fujii – piano
Peter Orins– drums

Formed only seven months before their remarkable debut recording Rafale, Kaze brings together trumpeter Natsuki Tamura and pianist Satoko Fujii, two of Japan's foremost improviser-composers, with trumpeter Christian Pruvost and drummer Peter Orins from the French improvisers collective, Muzzix.
The members of this international quartet share an insatiable appetite for sonic experimentation, boundless energy and enthusiasm, and the disciplined intelligence of accomplished spontaneous composers. Melodic, abstract, mysterious, beautiful, and confrontational, Kaze plays free jazz at its most creative and powerful.

2. Kaze debuted as a solo artist from the record label D-topia with the digital single ""Zurukare"" in 2011, in addition to featuring on several compilation albums. 

3. Kevin “Kaze” Thomas is a versatile artist-producer who captures the spirit of groundbreakers like Run-DMC, Snoop Dog, and Wu-Tang Clan to promote an on-going, innovative hip-hop culture. Hailing from northern Virginia and eastern North Carolina, Kaze grew up in the 80’s memorizing his big sister’s mix tapes of hip-hop legends to lift himself out of an oppressive country lifestyle. As a student in communications at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, Kaze helped to create Hip-Hop Nation, an on-campus organization fostering the growth of local emcees, poets, DJs, dancers, and graffiti artists. His mission gained national attention in 2001 when Kaze was tapped to co-create, produce, and host the nationally syndicated television program titled Hip-Hop Nation: Notes from the Underground. The show captured the immensity of the culture’s influence with viewers in over a hundred markets and linked Kaze’s name with a movement of international interest.

Kaze’s production experiences led to the establishment of his own record label, Soul Dojo, Inc. The initial offering under that label is his Spirit of ’94, a tribute to the legends of hip-hop featuring 15 tracks he both wrote and produced. Ingenuity and originality characterize his rhymes, while his words promote political consciousness, address personal trials, and celebrate the passion of hip-hop. The March 2003 release of Spirit of ‘94 set the standard for the label, claiming much critical acclaim and winning fans across the state. After selling thousands of copies independently, both on the streets and through mom and pop record stores, Spirit of ’94 was picked up by BCD Global Distribution in October of 2003 for placement into Transworld operated record stores such as FYE. The single, “50/50 Amp”, has received airplay on college and commercial radio stations across the country, charting with Billboard and with CMJ. Kaze peaked at number 11 on the Rap Network in March of 2004, a chart tabulated by spins from the tastemakers of college radio.

Kaze’s April 2004 sophomore effort, titled Enemy of the State, is a mixtape which features a collection of tracks by North Carolina’s finest hip-hop artists and producers. With notable appearances by Nature and 9th Wonder among others, Kaze uses the album as a platform for voicing his desire to make it to the top of the industry and chronicles his success and struggle thus far. Kaze’s first single from Enemy of the State titled “On” is due to grow on the strength of his debut and aims for an even greater audience.

Kaze has become one of the most talked about and recognizable figures in the North Carolina music scene. With strong personality and a unique style, he reigns as a tested mic battle champion and regularly lights up stages at nationally known venues across the Southeast including the Smith Center, Gusman Theater, Cat’s Cradle, Echo Lounge, Local 506, Apache Cafe, and The Brewery. He has opened for such artists as Nas, Jurassic 5, KRS-One Dead Prez, The Arsonists, Swollen Members, and Camp Lo. He also can be heard working the crowds for Soul Dojo’s premier open mic night, Microphone Mondays, at Rolling Stone Magazine’s favorite Chapel Hill music venue, the Local 506.

4. Cristian, a.k.a Kaze is a rapper from Cartagena, Spain. He released his first album, No Encajes, in 2016.

He began rapping in 2017 as Lil Yeat, and, after a slew of singles, released his first EP, Deep Blue Strips, in late 2018. In 2019, Yeat would gain further publicity after “Stay Up,” the lead single off his second project and first mixtape, Wake Up Call, received a music video on the popular YouTube channel ELEVATOR.

Smith released Different Creature, a collaborative EP with Dutch producer Clibbo, on July 18, 2019, to positive feedback. Yeat garnered further attention after dropping his second mixtape, I’m So Me, at the conclusion of the year, collaborating with popular producers like Wheezy, Brandon Finessin, and 10Fifty, among others. Yeat continued to gain traction throughout 2020, releasing two EPs meant to hold fans over until Different Creature 2. The project was scrapped as he worked through label issues before becoming independent in 2021. 

Fully in control of his output, Yeat began releasing a barrage of music, including twenty-track albums and countless singles. Yeat saw a major jump in support after his song “Sorry Bout That” blew up on TikTok. Subsequent hits like “Money Twerk” and “Get Busy” as well as a shout-out from Drake helped reinforce his newfound success. On August 5, 2021, Yeat released his newest EP, Trëndi.

In late 2021, Yeat would release his most popular album Up 2 Më and then would later drop 2 Älive  and its deluxe, 2 Alivë (Geëk Pack)

On February 16th, 2024, Yeat released 2093 which helped boost his music further. Tracks such as “Breathe"", “Psycho CEO"", and “If We Being Rëal became popular through various edits on TikTok. The album proved to be very popular, as it had a futuristic vibe and was not like some of the prior projects that Yeat had released before. 

Following on the success of 2093, on October 18, 2024, Yeat released his album Lyfestyle which gained a significant amount of attention, as it debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 200, making it his first number one album of his career, although it dropped to number 70 on the Billboard 200 on it's second week of release. Tracks such as “GEEK TIMË, “STFU, and “FOREVER AGAIN are just a few of the songs on the album which gained a lot of attraction.

58,don toliver,1782081,138932580,"Caleb Zackery “Don” Toliver (born June 12, 1994), is a rapper, singer, and songwriter from Houston, Texas. Toliver began his musical career in May 2017, releasing the collaborative mixtape Playa Familia with friend and fellow rapper Yungjosh93.

Don Toliver’s solo debut came just a few months later, with the debut singles “I Gotta” and “Diva” dropping in November and December, respectively. The singles quickly caught the ear of Atlantic Records, which signed Toliver to the label in March 2018. Under Atlantic, he released his major-label debut album, Donny Womack.

While working on the tape, Toliver caught the attention of fellow Houston native Travis Scott, who invited the young rapper to Hawaii to work on a song on his then-upcoming third studio album, ASTROWORLD. Eagerly accepting, the sessions landed Toliver a feature on the album’s thirteenth track, “CAN’T SAY” by Travis Scott, as well as inspiring him to record much of the material for Donny Womack.

On August 3, 2018, the same day as Travis released his album, he gave a major cosign to Toliver on Twitter:
Coincidentally, on August 2, 2018, Toliver dropped his own project Donny Womack the day before ASTROWORLD.

Genius caught up with the rising Houston artist just a few days before ASTROWORLD’s release to discuss his relationship with Travis, going to Hawaii for the ASTROWORLD sessions, and his hopes for Donny Womack, as his profile gets a dramatic boost.

When Genius asked him about how he met Travis and his relationship with him, he replied:

""When I first started linking up with Travis, somebody from my camp reached out to somebody in his camp. I sent them music and videos and it got to Travis and he was feeling it. He came back and we were able to link up and vibe.""

In May 2019, he released his single “No Idea”, the lead single of his March 2020 debut studio album, Heaven Or Hell. “No Idea” got its popularity from the viral social media app, TikTok, on all the lip-sync and dance videos on the app.

In December 2019, JACKBOYS (Cactus Jack Records members) and Travis Scott released their compilation album, JACKBOYS. On the album, Toliver has a track, titled “Had Enough” (also on Heaven Or Hell), featuring Quavo and Offset from the hip-hop trio Migos. He was also featured on another track by JACKBOYS and Travis, titled “WHAT TO DO?” from the album.

Doman, recruited Toliver to record and sing the chorus at the “last minute”.

66,omega,280613,2992663,"The are at least 8 artists called Omega
1. A Hungarian rock band
2. An alias of techno musician Naoki
3. A Lithuanian pop group
4. An American rapper
5. A dubstep artist
6. A British metal band
7. A Greek black/thrash/speed metal band
8. A Dominican mambo singer
9. A Chilean rapper

1. Omega is one of the most successful Hungarian rock bands. Formed in Budapest, Hungary in September, 1962 by the winds player László Benkő on vocal, piano and flute and János Kóbor as a lead singer and rhythm guitarist, they initially performed covers of British and American rock songs, with frequently changing the lineup of members. In 1967 Tamás Mihály came on bass, Gábor Presser joined on keyboards and began writing original music for the band (in 1968 György Molnár became a lead guitarist), releasing three LPs before leaving the band with József Laux, a drummer from 1962, to form Locomotív GT. These first albums were heavily influenced by the music of The Beatles, but they also looked forward to the band's future more progressive, space-rock style. After Presser and Laux's departure, the band found a new drummer (Ferenc Debreceni came from group Neoton Familia) and pointed Benkő as the main keyboardist, creating the current lineup, which has remained the same for over 30 years:

    * János Kóbor (""Mecky""), lead vocals
    * György Molnár (""Elefánt""), guitars
    * László Benkő (""Laci""), keyboards, vocals
    * Tamás Mihály (""Misi""), bass, vocals
    * Ferenc Debreceni (""Ciki""), drums

This lineup of Omega released ten more albums from 1972 to 1987. Many of these were released both in Hungarian and in English, in the hopes of generating wider interest in their music. However, the contents of the English albums often differed from their Hungarian counterparts, sometimes assembling tracks from several different albums and nearly always changing the song order. Following a few years of inactivity, the band reunited in 1994, with former member Gábor Presser joining them at concerts and contributing several tracks to 1995's Trans And Dance.

Omega has achieved modest international success through releases in multiple languages, and tours in England and Germany in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s. Their 1969 song ""Gyöngyhajú lány"" became an international hit, and was later covered by Scorpions on a 1995 live release, with new lyrics and the title ""White Dove"" (the Hungarian title officially was translated as ""Pearls In Her Hair"").

Omega's latest (16th) Hungarian studio release is 2006’s Égi jel (""Celestial Sign""), and their latest English release is 1996's Transcendent. In spring and summer of 2006, they performed their ""EurOmega 2006"" tour, including concerts in Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Germany.

Cazzu es una artista de música urbana que se caracteriza por haber sido siempre muy voluble. Ha trabajado muchos estilos durante toda su carrera, pero encontró en el trap y el reguetón su verdadero lenguaje. El trap es por definición un compendio de géneros aglutinados, y Cazzu conoce perfectamente todos y cada uno de ellos.


La trapera estudió cine, y su conocimiento de la estética visual le ha ayudado mucho a la hora de conformar la suya propia. Su estilo es desinhibición en estado puro. Cargada de energía, para dar caña con cada tema.

Cazzu, con temas suaves que invitan a bailar y a moverse, es conocedora de todos esos géneros tan interesantes que conforman el trap argentino. Por ello, la trapera es sin duda una de las reinas del trap latino e internacional.

Se presentó en el panorama con su primer tema Killa. Una canción que sienta unas bases muy claras, una carta de presentación como mujer empoderada, llena de espíritu underground. La artista se ha ganado el respeto de todos los artistas de trap del panorama latino, llegando a colaborar con muchos de ellos.

Sus colaboracion con Bad Bunny, Duki y Khea en LOCA y LOCA REMIX es un himno del trap mundial.

Born on June 8, 2003, Fuller embarked on his musical journey in 2017, dedicating himself to crafting music as a central pursuit. His passion for music led him to release numerous singles and EPs on platforms such as SoundCloud and YouTube between 2017 and 2019, gradually establishing a modest fanbase from these early recordings. In June 2019, he transitioned his SoundCloud music to mainstream streaming services.

In 2020, Fuller's music achieved heightened visibility through a TikTok video he created for his track ""Demons and Monsters,"" which garnered millions of views on the platform. This viral exposure was a pivotal moment, leading to a surge in popularity for the song and prompting its official release in September 2020. The track garnered significant attention, achieving a million streams within its first week. Around this time, 347aidan's musical style evolved from rap into a dynamic blend of hip-hop, alternative, and grungy bedroom pop anthems. 

His subsequent release, ""Dancing in My Room,"" gathered attention on TikTok before it was even released, due to a creator starting a dance trend to just the snippet of the song, resulting in countless dance videos. When the song was officially released on October 26, 2020, it amassed three million streams within its initial week. The track's rapid rise attracted the attention of Columbia Records, which signed Fuller to their roster shortly thereafter. ""Dancing in My Room"" received widespread recognition, earning a nomination for the 2021 SOCAN Songwriting Prize and achieving Platinum certification by Music Canada and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

In collaboration with prominent hip-hop producer Kenny Beats, known for his work with artists like Freddie Gibbs and Dominic Fike, Fuller released the hit single ""IDWK"" on January 25, 2021.

89,dj khaled,2499029,49288287,"Khaled Mohammed Khaled (/ˈkælɪd/; born November 26, 1975),[3] known professionally as DJ Khaled, is an American DJ, record producer, and record executive. Originally a Miami-based radio personality, Khaled has since become known for enlisting high-profile music industry artists to perform on singles and albums, for which he often serves as hype man. His distinctions are his booming voice presence, ""motivational"" abstractions, and numerous catchphrases. While his musical contribution is often questioned, Khaled's role has been described as ""organization, direction, [and] promotion"".[4][5]

Khaled was born in New Orleans to Palestinian immigrant parents. He first gained recognition as a radio host in the 1990s for the radio station 99 Jamz, and translated his popularity by working with Fat Joe's hip hop collective, Terror Squad, as a DJ for their live performances. Following his production credits on the group's material,[6] Khaled enlisted several hip hop artists associated with the group and his native Miami to perform on his debut studio album, Listennn... the Album (2006). His second album, We the Best (2007), spawned the hit single ""I'm So Hood"" (featuring T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross and Plies). His two subsequent releases—We Global (2008) and Victory (2010)—both peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200; the latter was supported by the single ""All I Do Is Win"" (featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross), which received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

His fifth studio album and major label debut, We the Best Forever (2011), saw continued commercial success and brought Khaled to mainstream prominence by spawning his first Billboard Hot 100-top ten single, ""I'm on One"" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross and Lil Wayne). His following three albums—Kiss the Ring (2012), Suffering from Success (2013), and I Changed a Lot (2015)—were released to moderate critical and commercial reception.[7] Throughout 2015 and 2016, Khaled gained wider recognition as a public figure due to his social media activity. This, along with several Internet memes, foresaw the release of his ninth studio album, Major Key (2016), which was met with further critical and commercial success as it debuted atop the Billboard 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.

His tenth album, Grateful (2017), became his second consecutive number-one album and was preceded by the singles ""I'm the One"" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) and ""Wild Thoughts"" (featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller), which peaked at numbers one and two on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. His eleventh album, Father of Asahd (2019), contained the song ""Higher"" (featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend), which won Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards—Khaled's first Grammy Award win. His eponymous twelfth album (2021) and thirteenth album, God Did (2022), both debuted atop the Billboard 200. The latter's title track (featuring Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend and Fridayy) earned three nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance.

Outside of music, Khaled has gained success as a writer, with his book The Keys featuring on the New York Times Best Seller list. He has also performed as an actor for the films Spies in Disguise (2019) and Bad Boys for Life (2020). His record label, We the Best Music Group has distributed his releases since its formation in 2008, though Khaled signed other artists to the imprint including Ace Hood, Kent Jones, Mavado, Flipp Dinero, and Vado, among others. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Khaled"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1) Hardcore arranger, principal arranger of KINZOK ON from Japan.
Also known as morrrrrro
KINZOK ON bandcamp: https://kinzokon.bandcamp.com/music
MORO on Twitter: https://twitter.com/moro_108


2) Moro is a beast composed of two reasonably-sentient beings: Nolan Thomas and Daniel Lee Ruff Smith, and born in the hills surrounding a village known as Eau Claire, WI. The beast is sometimes called ""M o r o"", or ""M O R O"" by different tribes.

After writhing in front of crowds of jubilant townsfolk a few times, and Lee Ruff taking a brief absence to travel to the Land of Thais, it regurgitated it's first offspring-- ""Embers""-- in a fiery cough. The townsfolk went mad for it, but it was too jittery to stay in one place, so it travelled throughout the globe on the back of the root-god Pando, whom some know as The Interwebs, among other names. The child was aided in it's travels by MJMJ Records and many friends.

Then Lee Ruff heard callings from afar, and split from it's Nolan-half to gain knowledge in the far off land of España for one half an earth cycle. Though less powerful due to their separation, the two beings were able to communicate with the aid of their friend-god Pando, speaking into his roots and sensing the vibrations on the other end. 

With a seed planted in their minds by the ancient tree-and-worker guardians, Simon & Garfunkel, they combined their powers and dreamed into existence their second child, ""Sound of Silence"". This child was requested of them by the Pando-rider Cactus-Mouth, who then took it forth along the roots and raised it as his own. 

It was then that Nolan-half began to feel unsatisfied with his choice to study the ancient and time-honored craft of Illustration, and made leave from the temple of UW-Eau Claire, at least for a time. With his newfound freedom and an approaching 21st birth-festival, his mother, Keli, offered forth the means for Nolan-half to visit the city København, in the realm of Danmark-- close to the Witch Woods of Sverige, where the Old Gods dwell. He sought refuge with his pal-being Mirko, and stayed in the living room of two wonderful she-Danes. 

By some chance of fate, Lee Ruff was also in the region, and the two beings were able to briefly reunite in the north-country of Uppsala, deep within the Witch Woods of Sverige. It was a long and perilous journey for Nolan-half, battling Sex-Trolls and SJ Railways, and his ability to communicate with Pando grew weak, causing many confusions. But through it all, he eventually found the Lee Ruff, and all was merry. Moro stomped as one through the halls of Upsalla by day, and gazed into it's clear pools by night, discussing with reasonable-sentience the nature of The Creator or The Great Unknown. Cats and ducks came to listen in and gain knowledge, but were keen to hide their own sentience. 

Alas, Moro was forced to split once again, returning to Eau Claire and España respectively. Nolan-half used up all his coins on food and travel in Danmark and Sverige, and now really really needs to get a job.

The two halves of Moro have resolved to sleep until June of the earth-cycle 2011, when they can be reunited once more in the village Eau Claire, and writhe for crowds and spew forth new offspring, and send them forth into the world with Pando and alive with Moro's magical instruments, and travel throughout the land with village-friends and make many many anew. The beast will be unstoppable. maybe. It will never stop dreaming.

93,tech n9ne,1037644,23873929,"Aaron Dontez Yates (born November 8, 1971 in Kansas City, Missouri), better known by his stage name Tech N9ne or Tecca Nina is an American rapper, co-owner of Strange Music Records and actor. His career has spanned over 24 years, during which he has released eleven albums. According to the He's a Mental Giant Songfacts, his stage name originated from the TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun, given to him by rapper Black Walt due to his fast rhyming style. (Tech is short for technique and 9 is the number of completion. That's why he says the technique's complete so often.)

His tenth studio album, K.O.D., was released October 27, 2009. He has spent his illustrious career making sure he’s been grinding harder than the average rapper, and is the best selling artist out of his hometown. With nine solo albums and two powerhouse collaboration projects under his belt, the Kansas City MC’s flow is sharper and slicker than it’s ever been.
“This is another roller coaster ride,” explains TECH N9NE about the release.  “When it came time for Sickology 101, I knew I wanted to do a collabo album based on the study of being sick. It’s a beginner’s course for people who don’t know how to be sick lyrically or how to choose sick beats. It all starts with beats because they tell me exactly what to do.” Epic beats from YoungFyre, Wyshmaster, Seven and Matic Lee set the stage for TECH N9NE to weave his introspective and sometimes roguish lyrics around. 

Sickology 101 brims with stellar appearances from lyrical heavyweights. On the opening title track, TECH N9NE slays alongside Chino XL and Crooked I, pulling listeners into the Hip-Hop classroom for a lesson in murdering a beat. It’s a twisted vision forged on undeniable grooves and quixotic wordplay. 

The single, “Nothin,’” is an inspiring, honest anthem that features Messy Marv and Big Scoob. Meanwhile, on “Midwest Choppers 2,” TECH N9NE and Krayzie Bone cruise to the depths of darkness. “Krayzie Bone came through and murdered it,” says TECH N9NE. “I modeled the song after movies. When you do a sequel, there has to be a bigger body count and more people have to die. ‘Midwest Choppers 2’ is Autobahn-style. It makes you want to speed.” 

TECH N9NE’s inimitable flow and rhyming take center stage on solo tracks, including the haunting, hypnotic “Red Nose.” He doesn’t pull any punches on the vitriolic, YoungFyre-produced “Blown Away,” either. It’s an open letter to several prominent urban artists who refused to play before him at radio festivals despite his massive concert draw. 

With hits like “I’m A Playa,” “Caribou Lou” (which boasts 7.2 million MySpace plays), “Riotmaker,” “Like Yeah” and “Everybody Move,” it’s no wonder TECH N9NE counts a total of over 4.5 million YouTube video plays and an average of 40,000 MySpace visitors each day. His success knows no limits. The July 2008 release, Killer, debuted at Number 1 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart and Number 12 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart. He did it all on his own. There was no major label — just TECH N9NE’s own record company, Strange Music. TECH N9NE’s tracks have appeared in films like Gang Related and Alpha Dog as well as various TV shows, and he recently made his motion picture debut in The Life of Lucky Cucumber alongside members of MTV’s “Jackass” crew. 

It hasn’t been an easy road, but TECH N9NE soldiers on and he’ll never stop. “They call me devil worshipper because I’m different. I give you music for my core. They’re the people that put me over the million mark. I raise my middle finger to everybody who judges me because my core audience is there for me. They will always love me, but I’m trying to reach others, too. It’s not over. My music is supposed to be for everybody, but some people just don’t get it. This album is the result; swallow it. It’s middle finger music, all-day and all-night.” 

TECH N9NE never stops bringing that music directly to his fans, constantly reinforcing his status as one of the hardest-touring rap acts in the business.  In 2008, TECH N9NE performed over 200 shows and he doesn’t show any signs of slowing down in 2009.  In April, TECH will head out in support of Sickology 101 and spend two months on the road, performing live for his rabid fans.   

Sickology 101 is prepping the world for TECH N9NE’s next masterpiece, K.O.D. “I want people to know that I’m getting better and better and I’m a machine. I do these collabo albums to give the fans more. This is a bridge record to K.O.D. It’s the farewell to the TECH N9NE you’ve known lately. It’s getting darker. A lot of people might not be able to go to the place I’m going, but this place is my specialty.” 

“I don’t need people to kiss my hand,” assures TECH N9NE. “I’m not trippin’ on status, and I’m not a narcissist when it comes to rap. It’s my heart and soul pouring onto the paper. I write my life and I can’t hold back. This is what I know.”

94,joyner lucas,572488,16714736,"Gary Maurice Lucas Jr. (born August 17, 1988) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, poet, and actor from Worcester, Massachusetts.

Lucas received widespread exposure and critical acclaim after the release of his single ""Ross Capicchioni"" in 2015. In June 2017, he released his fourth mixtape, 508-507-2209, which was his first on a major label. On November 28, 2017, Lucas released his single ""I'm Not Racist"", which quickly went viral, gaining him further attention and praise. The video was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Music Video at the 61st Grammy Awards. Lucas was formerly signed to Atlantic Records, until he announced his departure from the label in December 2018.

Since 2016, Lucas has also become known for remixing popular hip hop songs like ""Gucci Gang"" by Lil Pump, ""Bank Account"" by 21 Savage, ""DNA"" by Kendrick Lamar and many others. In October 2018, he announced his debut studio album ADHD, which was released on March 27, 2020. He began rapping at the age of 10, and attended South High Community School in Worcester.

Gary Maurice Lucas, Jr. was born on August 17, 1988, in Worcester, Massachusetts to a black father and a white mother. He began rapping at the age of 10, and attended South High Community School in Worcester.

Joyner Lucas first started rapping under the name G-Storm, but by 2007 had changed his stage name to Future Joyner and started working with his cousin Cyrus tha Great, forming a group called Film Skool Rejekts. That year they released Workprint: The Greatest Mixtape of All Time. Lucas released his first solo mixtape, titled Listen to Me, in 2011.[citation needed] After rapper Future came to prominence, Lucas dropped the ""Future"" from his name and continued as Joyner Lucas. He released his first mixtape under this new moniker in 2013, titled LFO's (Low Frequency Oscillators). His next mixtape, Along Came Joyner, was released on April 5, 2015. This mixtape contained his critically acclaimed ""Ross Capicchioni"". Following the success of the song, Lucas was featured in the 2015 BET Hip-Hop Awards Cypher. Originally intended to appear in the online-only cypher, he was later promoted to rap as part of the live broadcast cyphers based on the strength of his initial performance.

Lucas signed to Atlantic Records on September 21, 2016. Lucas went on to release a project titled 508-507-2209 on June 16, 2017, with Atlantic Records. The mixtape charted at #7 on the Heatseekers Albums chart on Billboard and contained the singles ""I'm Sorry"", ""Ultrasound"", ""Just Like You"" and ""Winter Blues"". Ever since 2016, Lucas has also become known for remixing popular hip hop songs.

On November 28, 2017, Lucas released the single ""I'm Not Racist"" via his YouTube channel. The music video quickly went viral and gained critical acclaim. The controversial song is about race and society, and race relations from the perspectives of a white man and a black man. The video was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Music Video at the 61st Grammy Awards, but lost to Childish Gambino's ""This Is America"". Lucas and Chris Brown announced a collaborative project titled Angels & Demons on February 25, 2018, with the project's first single ""Stranger Things"" releasing the following day. On April 1, 2018, Lucas released the single ""Frozen"", a song focused on different forms of reckless driving. The second single from the Angels and Demons collaborative mixtape, ""I Don't Die"", was released on May 2.

On July 31, 2018, Lucas announced that he was forced to cancel appearances in the Australian and European legs of his I'm Kind of a Big Deal tour due to hoarseness and laryngitis. A month later, Lucas was featured on ""Lucky You"" from Eminem's tenth album, Kamikaze. The song debuted at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Lucas' first top 10 entry on the chart. On October 12, 2018, Lucas announced that he would be releasing his debut studio album entitled ADHD. He also announced a single from the album that would be released the following Wednesday. The song, entitled ""I Love"", was released as the lead single from ADHD, which was released on March 27, 2020. It was preceded by nine singles from October 2018 to March 2020, the time before release.

On August 17, 2020, Lucas announced the release date of his debut EP, Evolution. It was released on October 23, 2020. It was preceded by two singles, ""Snitch"" and ""Fall Slowly"" featuring Ashanti.

Lucas has cited several artists as influences in his music, but he cites Eminem as his biggest musical influence. He also revealed he was influenced by Will Smith in his song ""Will"", which he would release a remix of featuring Will Smith himself on May 15, 2020. He cites Jay-Z as one of his influences too.

Joyner Lucas shares a son named Joyner Messiah Lucas (born February 20, 2016) with Carmen Julissa Ayala, whom he had an off and on romantic relationship with. Lucas tells the story of his son's conception in his song ""Forever"" on his mixtape 508-507-2209. Joyner Messiah Lucas is loved and adored by his father and referenced in many of his songs. He has also made cameos in his father's music videos. Most recently he played Will Smith's son Jaden Smith in the video of ""Will"".

Lucas has revealed that the title of his album ADHD comes from the fact that he was diagnosed with ADHD as a child. He explained that people surrounding him, including his own parents, made him feel like he was not normal and treated him differently as a result. Eventually, he would act out and get sent to an alternative school after expulsion.

Feuds

Logic

According to Lucas, when he was on Tech N9ne's tour bus, he heard some records from Tech's album The Storm. Lucas expressed interest on collaborating with Logic on the song ""Sriracha"" and felt that he could add to the display of fast-flow rapping, and Tech acquiesced. Logic was originally slated to be the only feature on ""Sriracha"", but when he spent over six months to deliver his verse, Lucas hopped on the track to offer his own. Joyner stated that when they got the record back, he could tell that Logic was not ""too happy"" about him being on the track once he heard it. On his remix of Future's ""Mask Off"", Joyner, unhappy by the work Logic turned in after taking nearly half a year to edit his verse, directly addressed the disappointing display. Both he and Tech N9ne were upset with Logic for not emulating the style of quick flow on the song.

After Logic's hit song ""1-800-273-8255"" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, Joyner Lucas immediately took offense and argued that the track was named in order to bring direct competition to his project, 508-507-2209. In a later interview, he called Logic ""corny"" and in another incident, he said that he thinks that Logic ""can rap"" but feels like ""he tries to prove that he's black too much for me."" With both Logic's single and Lucas' mixtape dealing with the issue of mental health representation and resource allocation, Lucas was careful to not slam the track too hard.

When Logic dropped his song ""Yuck"" from his mixtape Bobby Tarantino II in March 2018, the veiled diss inside the song was quickly spotted by Lucas and his fans, despite Logic saying that there was no diss in the song. Seemingly nonplussed by the insult, Lucas dared Logic to call him out directly on Twitter. That same month, Joyner took aim at Logic's song ""44 More"" and his album Everybody on his remix of BlocBoy JB's ""Look Alive"".

In 2019, the two rappers ended their feud, which was revealed when Logic made a guest appearance on Joyner Lucas' song ""ISIS"", the third single from ADHD. Lucas kept the name of the collaborator a secret until he released the song.

Hopsin

In September 2018, when a fan asked Los Angeles rapper Hopsin on Twitter who would win in a rap battle between him and Joyner Lucas, Hopsin replied, ""That's a dumb question that I'm sure you already know the answer to."" Not long after, Lucas commented, ""Hold up. @Hopsin wtf is that supposed to mean???"" In his response, Hopsin stated that he would ""b[r]eak his soul"" and also dissed Logic in the comment. This dispute would prove to be short-lived, when in less than two days Hopsin shared a screenshot of a FaceTime call with Lucas, indicating that they finally made peace, but still wanted people to consider who would beat the other in a rap battle. While the majority favored Hopsin, Lucas was adamant without arguing.

Tory Lanez

Joyner Lucas' feud with Canadian recording artist Tory Lanez began over matters similar to his beef with Hopsin. On November 19, 2018, Lanez claimed that he was a better rapper than Joyner Lucas on an Instagram Live session. Incredulous, Lucas immediately responded by inviting Lanez to a battle rapping challenge and telling him to let the public decide who is better. The next day, Lanez dropped a freestyle over Eminem's ""Lucky You"", of which Lucas made a guest appearance on. In less than 24 hours, Joyner responded with his freestyle over ""Litty"" by Meek Mill featuring Tory Lanez, also targeting rapper Trippie Redd, who joined Tory's Instagram Live and slandered Joyner's name as well. Shortly after, Lanez retaliated with his own freestyle of ""Litty"", titled ""Litty Again"", taking shots at Joyner's collaboration with Eminem. Lucas' answer song was a freestyle of Kodak Black's ""Zeze"". On the track, he mentions Tory's being accused of plagiarism in 2016, when listeners noticed that the ending of Lanez's song ""4am Flex"" was similar to Kendrick Lamar's ""The Art of Peer Pressure"". Joyner also accuses him of copying rapper Don Q's flow on his 2017 Funkmaster Flex freestyle. On November 23, Tory posted on Instagram a video of him declaring victory in the feud and celebrating. Displeased, Lucas reposted the video with his own comment, with a reference to Lanez as a singer.

The end of this rivalry was made public on August 8, 2019, when Joyner Lucas and Tory Lanez collaborated on their remix of ""Suge"" by DaBaby.

The Grammy Awards are held annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Joyner has two Grammy nominations altogether; one for Best Music Video for “I’m Not Racist” and one for Best Rap Song for “Lucky You” by Eminem.

He was known for his unique flow as well as his ""oddly expressive, poetic word-choices"", leading the Los Angeles Times to call him ""the most original West Coast stylist in decades.""

After recording a handful of mixtapes with much more of a trap influence than the West Coast hip hop he became known for, he was discovered by DJ Mustard, who remixed his song Mr. Get Dough. The song, which premiered on WorldStar in April 2015, became his breakout song, and has amassed over 6.2 million YouTube views (as of August 2019). Six months later, in October, Drakeo release his official debut mixtape, I Am Mr. Mosely, as his first project under Mustard's 10 Summers label.

He released his second project, I Am Mr. Mosely 2, on 21 July 2016, with features which included Mozzy, Skeme, and Philthy Rich.  He followed this up with the release of So Cold I Do Em in December, which included of his most popular songs, Impatient Freestyle. 

After his jail release in November 2017, he recorded a 16-track mixtape, Cold Devil, in 10 days, and released it the following month. Paul A. Thompson of Pitchfork described it as ""the most compelling album of the Los Angeles emcee’s career,"" adding that his ""avant deadpan and impressionistic relationship to the beat"" is ""icy and unforgettable.""Similarly, Grant Rindner of Complex called it ""one of the most impressive California rap projects in years"". He released music videos for Flu Flamming, Big Banc Uchies and Out the Slums within a month, amassing 4.4 million, 3.6 million and 4.0 million YouTube views, respectively. Flu Flamming was also notably remixed by Lil Yachty, and Big Banc Uchies by Shy Glizzy. The music video for Roll Bounce was released in September, with Drakeo in jail awaiting trial.

Caldwell was stabbed backstage at around 8:30 p.m. on December 18, 2021, during the Once Upon a Time in LA festival. Initial eyewitness accounts reported that he was stabbed in the neck during an altercation; later, his mother Darrylene Corniel revealed in an interview with Rolling Stone that Caldwell, his brother, and their entourage were attacked by ""around 40, 60 men"" in masks around the time of YG's arrival to the venue, and that Caldwell had been stabbed in the neck. Paramedics arrived at the scene at around 8:40 p.m. and transported Caldwell to a nearby hospital in critical condition. The event itself was cancelled shortly afterward.

Caldwell was pronounced dead as a result of his stab wounds at around midnight on December 19, 2021, roughly four hours after the initial altercation. As of December 21, 2021, the Los Angeles Police Department is investigating his death as a homicide. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/DRAKEO+The+Ruler"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

98,nf,1065866,74987115,"NF is the stage name of rapper and composer Nate Feuerstein from Gladwin, Michigan. Feuerstein endured a hardship-filled childhood in which his parents divorced, his mother's boyfriend physically abused him, and his mother eventually killed herself. Music was his escape, and he began recording songs on a karaoke machine, with instrumentals on one microphone and his raps in the other. Placing second in a nationwide Fine Arts Festival rap competition in 2008, and first in Michigan the following year, he independently released a debut album, Moments, in 2010. The album attracted the attention of Xist Music, which signed him to a recording deal in 2012, by which time Feuerstein had taken on the stage name NF. The label announced the release of an EP that same year, but it never appeared, and NF and Xist parted ways. NF spent the next two years looking for a label and working with local producer Tommee Profitt in his studio; they came up with the song ""Wake Up,"" which convinced Capitol Christian Music Group to sign him. CMG released a six-song (including a Manny Marroquin remix of ""Wake Up"") self-titled EP late in the summer of 2014. His debut album, Mansion, was released in early 2015 and reached number 62 on the Billboard 200 while topping the Christian Albums chart. The aptly titled Therapy Session followed in 2016 and also topped the Christian Albums chart with its raw emotions and honest lyrics. The following Summer saw the release of the singles ""Outro"" and ""Green Lights"", in anticipation of the arrival of his third studio long player, Perception, which dropped later that October. NF achieved mainstream popularity in 2017 with Perception; the album charted at number one in the United States and was certified platinum, while its third single, ""Let You Down"", reached number twelve on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was a top-ten hit internationally. He achieved similar commercial success with his follow-up The Search (2019).

A childhood fascination with electronic duo  Daft Punk's seminal album Discovery and the musical Cats gave him a keen awareness of the importance of visual presentation. As a teen, he taught himself the drums and started a heavy metal band, playing and writing songs by ear. He was later drawn to b-boying and breakdancing as a form of physical self-expression, skipping class to busk in downtown Sydney and documenting his freestyles on Youtube.
His channel gave him an audience, and it even connected him with his future DPR collaborator and friend Hong Da-Bin (also known as DPR LIVE). After graduating from his performing arts school in 2008, he bought an one-way ticket to Seoul to pursue his dreams as a dancer. He debuted as the leader and rapper of K-Pop group C-Clown in 2012, performing as Rome.
His experience as an Idol was short lived and tumultuous - the unit disbanded in 2015 -but it did give him a better understanding of the industry. So when he synched back with his friend Hong and Scott Kim (DPR REM) to discuss making something together, he knew that he wanted the next stage of his career to be rooted in creative freedom, authenticity, and community.

122,eminem,6916471,454938914,"Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972 in St. Joseph, MO), known professionally as Eminem (stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is credited with popularizing hip-hop in Middle America and is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. His success is considered to have broken racial barriers to the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as influencing many musical artists. His most successful songs on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 include ""The Real Slim Shady"", ""Without Me"", ""Lose Yourself"", ""Not Afraid"", ""Love the Way You Lie"", ""The Monster"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Houdini"".

After the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2002. After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry with the releases of Relapse (2009) and Recovery (2010), the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2010. He then released the U.S. number-one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018), Music to Be Murdered By (2020), and The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) (2024).

Eminem was also a member of the hip-hop groups New Jacks, Soul Intent, Outsidaz, and D12, and has collaborated with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9"" as the duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem starred in the 2002 musical drama film 8 Mile playing a dramatized version of himself. ""Lose Yourself"", a song from its soundtrack, topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 weeks—the most for a solo rap song—and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making him the first hip-hop artist ever to win the award. He also co-founded Shady Records, which helped launch the careers of artists such as D12, 50 Cent, and Obie Trice, and established his own Sirius XM Radio channel, Shade 45.

Eminem is amongst the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States for the 2000s, placing third for the 2010s. He was the first artist to have ten albums consecutively debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and has had five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits (2005), ""Lose Yourself"", ""Love the Way You Lie"", and ""Not Afraid"" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. Billboard named him the ""Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)"", and Rolling Stone named him one of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"" and ""100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time"". In 2022, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Early life

Marshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah ""Debbie"" (née Nelson). His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him. Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before they separated. His father abandoned his family when Eminem was a year and a half old, and Eminem was raised only by his mother, Debbie, in poverty. He wrote letters to his father, but Debbie said that they all came back marked ""return to sender"".

By the age of twelve, Eminem and his mother shuttled between states, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and mostly living with family members, moved several times and lived in St. Joseph, Savannah, Missouri, Kansas City, Warren, Michigan and Roseville, Michigan before settling in Detroit. For much of his youth, Eminem and his mother lived in a working-class, primarily black, Detroit neighborhood. He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten several times by black youths. His mother had a son named Nathan ""Nate"" Kane Samara.

Eminem frequently fought with his mother, whom a social worker described as having a ""very suspicious, almost paranoid personality"". When he was a child, a bully named D'Angelo Bailey severely injured Eminem's head in an assault, an incident which Eminem later recounted (with comic exaggeration) on the song ""Brain Damage"". Debbie filed a lawsuit against the public school for this in 1982. The suit was dismissed the following year by a Macomb County, Michigan, judge, who said the schools were immune from lawsuits.

Eminem was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic book artist before discovering hip-hop. He heard his first rap song (""Reckless"", featuring Ice-T) on the Breakin' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie's half-brother, Ronnie Polkingharn. His uncle was close to the boy and later became a musical mentor to him. Following Polkingharn's suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking publicly for days and did not attend his funeral.

At age 14, Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names ""Manix"" and ""M&M"", the latter evolving into ""Eminem"". Eminem snuck into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles. On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile Road, considered ""ground zero"" for the Detroit rap scene. Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip-hop audiences. When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable. Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes.

In 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Anne ""Kim"" Scott to stay at their home. Several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott. After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades, 17-year-old Eminem dropped out of Lincoln High School. Although interested in English, Eminem never explored literature, preferring comic books, and he disliked math and social studies. He states that he later received a GED.Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills, one of which was at Little Caesar's Pizza in Warren. He later said she often threw him out of the house anyway, often after taking most of his paycheck. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.

Alter egos

Eminem uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter, including Slim Shady and Ken Kaniff, among others.

Slim Shady is the controversial and rebellious alter ego of Eminem, introduced in his 1997 extended play The Slim Shady EP. Conceived during a period of personal and professional struggle, Slim Shady allowed Eminem to express his darker, more aggressive thoughts through exaggerated and often violent lyrical content. This persona embodies the chaotic, satirical side of Eminem's music, pushing boundaries with provocative, sometimes offensive, themes, which blend fiction and reality. The use of Slim Shady is shown in The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Encore, Relapse, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, Kamikaze, Music to Be Murdered By, and The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce).

Slim Shady's influence on Eminem's career is significant. His shock-value content helped skyrocket the rapper to fame, but also attracted criticism and legal challenges, particularly due to songs like ""'97 Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""Kim"", where he addresses deeply personal and often disturbing subjects, such as family conflicts and imagined violence. Despite the controversy, the Slim Shady character is credited with much of Eminem's early success, but over time, the persona also contributed to the rapper's personal struggles, including substance abuse.

Another character is Ken Kaniff, a gay man who pokes fun at Eminem's songs. Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on The Slim Shady LP, where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem. An argument after the album's release prompted Eminem to use the Kaniff character on The Marshall Mathers LP and later albums (except Encore and Recovery). Aristotle, angry with Eminem's use of his character, released a mixtape in his Kaniff persona ridiculing him.

Acting Career

After small roles in the 2001 film The Wash and as an extra in the 1998 Korn music video for ""Got the Life"" (during which he gave the band a demo tape), Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the semi-autobiographical 2002 film 8 Mile. He said it was a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including ""Lose Yourself"" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running No. 1 hip-hop single in history). Eminem was absent from the ceremony and co-composer Luis Resto accepted the award.

Eminem voiced an aging, corrupt, AAVE-speaking police officer in the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof and guested on the Comedy Central television show Crank Yankers and a Web cartoon, The Slim Shady Show He was signed to star in an unmade film version of Have Gun – Will Travel, and was considered for the role of David Rice in the 2008 film Jumper. Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with Ray Romano, in the 2009 film Funny People. In a 2010 interview with Jonathan Ross, he stated ""You know, I love music so much. This is my passion, this is what I want to do. Not saying that I won't do a movie ever again, but this is me.""

He played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale ""Lose Yourself"" with Christina Aguilera. Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because director Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit. Eminem had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2014 film The Interview. During an interview with the main character, Dave Skylark (James Franco), Eminem satirically comes out as gay.

Books and memoirs

On November 21, 2000, Eminem published Angry Blonde, a non-fiction book featuring a commentary of several of his own songs, along with several previously unpublished photographs.

On October 21, 2008, his autobiography The Way I Am was published. The book was first published on October 21, 2008, by Dutton Adult. It is a collection of Eminem's personal stories, reflections, photographs, original artwork, and original lyric sheets from ""Stan"" and ""The Real Slim Shady"". It details his struggles with poverty, drugs, fame, heartbreak, family and depression, along with stories about his rise to fame and commentary on past controversies. The book is illustrated with never before published photos of Eminem's life. It also contains original drawings, previously unpublished lyric sheets, and other rare memorabilia. The autobiography is named after his 2000 song ""The Way I Am"".

An autobiography of Eminem's mother (My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem) was published the following month, in which Debbie Nelson describes her childhood and adolescence, meeting Eminem's father and her son's rise to (and struggles with) fame.

124,$uicideboy$,1268920,338667899,"$uicideboy$ are an American hip-hop duo from New Orleans, Louisiana, founded in 2014 by cousins Ruby da Cherry and $crim. Via the music sharing platform SoundCloud, the duo rose to popularity for their abrasive, self-produced beats, as well as their harsh lyrical content and themes prominently featuring substance use disorder and suicidal ideation. The duo are considered one of the most popular artists in the underground rap scene. They own and operate their own label, G*59 Records, under which all of their music is signed. 

The music of $uicideBoy$ varies between different sub-genres of rap; while some songs have melancholy tones with lyrical content that focuses on subjects such as depression and suicidal ideation (topics not widely exposed in rap music), others are wildly aggressive, with themes of violence and sexual content. Some of their music is based around life growing up in New Orleans; song titles such as Audubon, Tulane, Elysian Fields and St. Bernard reflect streets and neighborhoods that influenced the life of Arceneaux and Petrou. A large portion of their music focuses on depression and its symptoms, an angle not often received in mainstream hip hop; Arceneaux elaborated on this in an interview with Mass Appeal, stating, “A lot of people take it as emo, or depressed music, or negative music... it’s really just connecting. It’s therapy, through music"". Excluding occasional guest producers, the entirety of Suicideboys' discography is self-produced, mainly by Arceneaux under his pseudonym Budd Dwyer (an homage to the former politician of the same name).

$crim was born Scott Arceneaux Jr. on April 11, 1989 in Marrero, Louisiana. Arceneaux originally was inspired by T-Pain and Kanye West to produce music, buying his first laptop which he used to start DJing with money gained from selling drugs. Arceneaux's passion for DJing extended when he started to attend Delgado Community College, where he was hired to DJ parties. He also worked selling used furniture, getting fired for his new hand tattoos after three years.

Ruby da Cherry was born Aristos Petrou (Αρίστος Πέτρου) on April 22, 1990 to an American mother and Greek Cypriot father. Raised in Metairie, Louisiana, Petrou's interest in music began when he was seven, playing violin and then drums when he was ten, eventually joining bands in middle school. He worked at his father's restaurant as a waiter, a job he held until 2015. His experience with the punk rock scene continued as he joined the band Vapo-Rats as its drummer; however, disillusioned with the apathy his bandmates showed towards the future of the band, Petrou left in order to pursue a career in hip-hop with Arceneaux.

Arceneaux and Petrou are cousins, and as such shared a close relationship growing up. Realising that both were interested in taking a musical career seriously, and both dissatisfied with the direction of their lives, the two formed Suicideboys, making a pact that if their musical career didn’t work out, they would both commit suicide. Elaborating on this in an interview with Mass Appeal, Arceneaux states that, “it was pretty much like cutting the hand, bleeding, and making a pact that there’s no plan B, that if this doesn’t happen by the time we’re 30, I’m blowing my head off”.

The duo's first project together, a three-track EP named Kill Yourself Part I: The $uicide $aga, was released in June 2014 on SoundCloud and Bandcamp, attracting attention for their collaboration with notable underground rapper Bones. In the following months, the duo released a further nine iterations of the Kill Yourself series. After a number of collaboration EPs with fellow underground artist Black Smurf, their first full length project titled Gray/Grey was released on March 3, 2015.

Suicideboys' underground breakthrough came with the release of 2015 EP $outh $ide $uicide, a collaboration with established South Florida rapper Pouya, which thrust the duo into the underground rap spotlight.

In late 2018, a rumor arose that the group had broken up following a series of ominous tweets. However, they soon clarified that the tweets were in relation to ""personal issues"" facing Arceneaux, and that they had in fact not broken up. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/$uicideboy$"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Known first as a producer who broke through with and 's ""Fuck a Swisher"" (2017), Dallas native Kankan realized he was a dual threat after he tried his hand at rapping. Since taking the mike for laughs, he has proven to be a quick study, refining his unhurried flow and urgent lyrics with a torrent of output including ""Wokeup,"" his most popular track, and EP and full-length projects such as Kankan (2019) and WAY2GEEKED (2022).

Dallas native Kankan, born Keandrian Qynzel Jones, effectively launched his career through SoundCloud, networking on the platform and becoming part of the loose, short-lived collective known as Slayworld. He gained major ground throughout 2017, producing ""Fuck a Swisher,"" as well as and 's ""Talkin Shit"" and 's ""No Tomorrow."" Within a couple years, he discovered his voice – unintentionally so, after he jokingly asked his Instagram followers if he should ""hop in the booth"" – and enjoyed the challenge so much that he shifted focus. In 2019 alone, he issued numerous tracks and a pair of EP-length projects, Radiant 2 (with Kobe) and Kankan. A slew of additional tracks and another EP, B4 AMGs & SRTS, arrived the next year. The Oxy & Codeine EP and Rr (a full-length featuring a pair of collaborations), along with the particularly well-received single ""Wokeup,"" highlighted his 2021 activities. No less busy in 2022, Kankan was behind another EP, ##B4W2G, and the full-length WAY2GEEKED.

129,mac miller,2953883,326290011,"Malcolm McCormick, also known by his stage name Mac Miller, was an American rapper, singer-songwriter and record producer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was also a noted record producer under the pseudonym Larry Fisherman. Raised Jewish and teaching himself music from a young age, McCormick defied the stereotypes of hip-hop and released his first mixtape under the name EZ Mac, titled ""But My Mackin' Ain't Easy"" in 2007, when McCormick was only fifteen. He released many more in his lifetime, including ""K.I.D.S."" in 2010, which earned Mac widespread attention in the hip-hop scene, and ""Best Day Ever"" in 2011, which featured the hit single ""Donald Trump"". 

He was signed to Pittsburgh-based Rostrum Records and released his debut album Blue Slide Park on November 8, 2011, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 despite being released completely independently. He released five studio albums in his lifetime, which all peaked in the top 5, along with a posthumous album titled ""Circles"" with help from producer Jon Brion and Miller's family.

In 2013, Miller released his second studio album, ""Watching Movies With the Sound Off"". The album featured artists such as Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler, The Creator, Ab-Soul, and long-time friend ScHoolboy Q. The album took a more personal approach compared to his previous works.

In 2014, Miller released the 24-track mixtape ""Faces"". Considered by many to be one of his best works, he explores themes of drug use, employing and featuring collaborators of Mac from his previous album, including ScHoolboy Q and Earl Sweatshirt, but also sees new faces such as Rick Ross. 

In 2015, Mac released his third studio album, ""GO:OD AM"", his first with new label Warner Records. The album featured a more energetic and vibrant theme than ""Faces"" and ""Watching Movies With the Sound Off"", reflecting a more optimistic,  redemptive angle on his personal life, while maintaining elements of his introspective and thought-provoking style from earlier works.

In 2016, Miller released his fourth studio album, titled ""The Divine Feminine"". He explores themes of love and femininity, largely influenced by his relationship with Ariana Grande at the time and featuring appearances from the likes of Kendrick Lamar and Anderson Paak. 

In August 2018, following major events in Miller's life, including his breakup with Ariana Grande, with Miller's drug addiction alleged to be a contributing factor, as well as a car crash incident in which McCormick was charged with a DUI, Miller released his fifth and final studio album during his lifetime titled ""Swimming"". Continuing the dive into his personal life, Miller explores his heartfelt struggles and grief in the past, but remains optimistic for the future. Swimming was nominated for Best Rap Album posthumously at the 2019 Grammy Awards.

Miller had struggled with substance abuse for a long time before his death. On September 7, 2018, he was found dead in his home in Los Angeles, California from an accidental overdose of fentanyl, cocaine, and alcohol, only a little over a month after the release of ""Swimming"".  He was only 26 years old. McCormick was buried in his hometown of Pittsburgh. Miller's passing was largely unexpected and had a large impact on the hip-hop community as a whole, with many paying their respects to Miller.  On October 31, 2018, a tribute concert, titled ""Mac Miller: A Celebration of Life"", featured renowned artists and many longtime collaborators of Miller including Travis Scott, ScHoolboy Q, SZA, Chance the Rapper, and Earl Sweatshirt. The concert was a celebration of the late rapper's life and musical achievements, and all profits were donated to the Mac Miller Circles Fund, which provides young people from underprivileged backgrounds with opportunities to explore arts and music.

 In January 2020, Miller's posthumous album titled ""Circles"", worked on in companionship with his album ""Swimming"", was announced on January 8 along with the single ""Good News"" and released later that month. Every track on the album was accompanied by a video of the same name, often with psychedelic imagery and images of Mac before his passing and throughout his life. With a more melancholic theme compared to his previous works, the album was well-received by fans and critics alike, renowned for the care placed in continuing Mac's artistic vision. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mac+Miller"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Thug grew to prominence in 2013 after releasing his mixtape 1017 Thug to positive critical reception. He has collaborated with artists such as Gucci Mane, Young Scooter, Rich Homie Quan and Waka Flocka Flame.

Thug was born amongst the masses eliminating any doubt that he wouldn’t be special. The second youngest child of 11 children developed a skill for standing out amongst many, early. Young Thug moved to Jonesboro, an impoverished suburb of Georgia where his lifestyle was engrossed by the crime, drug addiction and violence that surrounded him. It was there that he developed an insatiable appetite to succeed his current situation. After discovering and acknowledging his talent and creativity for music in  2010, Thug started a new hustle that would soon mature as one of the most promising music careers in the South. He also founded the record label YSL ( Young Stoner/Slatt Life) in 2010.


Eyeballing the throne of Hip hop royalty, Young Thug began to create a sound and style that would inevitably place him on top. Young Thug’s catchy verses and raw lyrical talent distinguished noise from art, clearly being the latter his creations are the best that remain of Southern hip hop. He is the embodiment of the evolution of Southern hip-hop. Young Thug is the representative for a generation that doesn't see hip-hop as a hobby but a lifestyle.

132,the notorious b.i.g.,3540573,89240361,"Christopher George Latore Wallace (May 21, 1972 – March 9, 1997), known professionally as The Notorious B.I.G., Biggie Smalls, or Biggie, was an American rapper. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time.

Wallace was born and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. His debut album Ready to Die (1994) made him a central figure in East Coast hip hop and increased New York City's visibility in the genre at a time when West Coast hip hop dominated the mainstream. The following year, he led Junior M.A.F.I.A.—a protégé group composed of his childhood friends—to chart success. In 1996, while recording his second album, Wallace was heavily involved in the growing East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud. On March 9, 1997, he was murdered by an unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles. His second album, Life After Death (1997), released two weeks later, rose to No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. In 2000, it became one of the few hip-hop albums to be certified Diamond.

Wallace was noted for his ""loose, easy flow""; dark, semi-autobiographical lyrics; and storytelling abilities, which focused on crime and hardship. Three more albums have been released since his death, and he has certified sales of over 17 million records in the United States, including 13.4 million albums.

Wallace was born at St. Mary's Hospital in the Brooklyn borough of New York City on May 21, 1972, the only child of Jamaican immigrant parents. His mother, Voletta Wallace, was a preschool teacher, while his father, Selwyn George Latore, was a welder and politician. His father left the family when Wallace was two years old, and his mother worked two jobs while raising him. Wallace grew up at 226 St. James Place in Brooklyn's Clinton Hill, near the border with Bedford-Stuyvesant. Wallace excelled at Queen of All Saints Middle School winning several awards as an English student. He was nicknamed ""Big"" because he was overweight by the age of 10. Wallace said he started dealing drugs when he was around the age of 12. His mother, often away at work, did not know of his drug dealing until he was an adult. He began rapping as a teenager, entertaining people on the streets, and performed with local groups the Old Gold Brothers and the Techniques. At his request, Wallace transferred from Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School to George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, where future rappers DMX, Jay-Z, and Busta Rhymes were also attending. According to his mother, Wallace was still a good student but developed a ""smart-ass"" attitude at the new school. At age 17, Wallace dropped out of school and became more involved in crime. In 1989, he was arrested on weapons charges in Brooklyn and sentenced to five years' probation. In 1990, he was arrested on a violation of his probation. A year later, Wallace was arrested in North Carolina for dealing crack cocaine. He spent nine months in jail before making bail.

Wallace's lyrical topics and themes included mafioso tales (""Niggas Bleed""), his drug-dealing past (""10 Crack Commandments""), materialistic bragging (""Hypnotize""), as well as humor (""Just Playing (Dreams)""), and romance (""Me & My Bitch""). Rolling Stone named Wallace in 2004 as ""one of the few young male songwriters in any pop style writing credible love songs"".

Guerilla Black, in the book How to Rap, describes how Wallace was able to both ""glorify the upper echelon"" and ""[make] you feel his struggle"". According to Touré of The New York Times in 1994, Wallace's lyrics "" autobiographical details about crime and violence with emotional honesty"". Marriott of The New York Times (in 1997) believed his lyrics were not strictly autobiographical and wrote he ""had a knack for exaggeration that increased sales"". Wallace described his debut as ""a big pie, with each slice indicating a different point in my life involving bitches and niggaz... from the beginning to the end"".

Ready to Die is described by Rolling Stone as a contrast of ""bleak"" street visions and being ""full of high-spirited fun, bringing the pleasure principle back to hip-hop"". AllMusic write of ""a sense of doom"" in some of his songs and the NY Times note some being ""laced with paranoia""; Wallace described himself as feeling ""broke and depressed"" when he made his debut. The final song on the album, ""Suicidal Thoughts"", featured Wallace contemplating suicide and concluded with him committing the act.

On Life After Death, Wallace's lyrics went ""deeper"". Krims explains how upbeat, dance-oriented tracks (which featured less heavily on his debut) alternate with ""reality rap"" songs on the record and suggests that he was ""going pimp"" through some of the lyrical topics of the former. XXL magazine wrote that Wallace ""revamped his image"" through the portrayal of himself between the albums, going from ""midlevel hustler"" on his debut to ""drug lord"".

AllMusic wrote that the success of Ready to Die is ""mostly due to Wallace's skill as a storyteller""; in 1994, Rolling Stone described Wallace's ability in this technique as painting ""a sonic picture so vibrant that you're transported right to the scene"". On Life After Death, Wallace notably demonstrated this skill on ""I Got a Story to Tell"", creating a story as a rap for the first half of the song and then retelling the same story ""for his boys"" in conversation form.

Considered one of the best rappers of all time, Wallace was described by AllMusic as ""the savior of East Coast hip-hop"". The Source magazine named Wallace the greatest rapper of all time in its 150th issue in 2002. In 2003, when XXL magazine asked several hip hop artists to list their five favorite MCs, Wallace's name appeared on more rappers' lists than anyone else. In 2006, MTV ranked him at No. 3 on their list of The Greatest MCs of All Time, calling him possibly ""the most skillful ever on the mic"". Editors of About.com ranked him No. 3 on their list of the Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987–2007). In 2012, The Source ranked him No. 3 on their list of the Top 50 Lyrical Leaders of all time. Rolling Stone has referred to him as the ""greatest rapper that ever lived"". In 2015, Billboard named Wallace as the greatest rapper of all time.

Since his death, Wallace's lyrics have been sampled and quoted by a variety of hip hop, R&B and pop artists including Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Alicia Keys, Fat Joe, Nelly, Ja Rule, Eminem, Lil Wayne, Game, Clinton Sparks, Michael Jackson and Usher. On August 28, 2005, at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, Sean Combs (then using the rap alias ""P. Diddy"") and Snoop Dogg paid tribute to Wallace: an orchestra played while the vocals from ""Juicy"" and ""Warning"" played on the arena speakers. In September 2005, VH1 held its second annual ""Hip Hop Honors"", with a tribute to Wallace headlining the show.

Wallace had begun to promote a clothing line called Brooklyn Mint, which was to produce plus-sized clothing but fell dormant after he died. In 2004, his managers, Mark Pitts and Wayne Barrow, launched the clothing line, with help from Jay-Z, selling T-shirts with images of Wallace on them. A portion of the proceeds go to the Christopher Wallace Foundation and to Jay-Z's Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation. In 2005, Voletta Wallace hired branding and licensing agency Wicked Cow Entertainment to guide the estate's licensing efforts. Wallace-branded products on the market include action figures, blankets, and cell phone content.

The Christopher Wallace Memorial Foundation holds an annual black-tie dinner (""B.I.G. Night Out"") to raise funds for children's school equipment and to honor Wallace's memory. For this particular event, because it is a children's schools' charity, ""B.I.G."" is also said to stand for ""Books Instead of Guns"".

There is a large portrait mural of Wallace as Mao Zedong on Fulton Street in Brooklyn a half-mile west from Wallace's old block. A fan petitioned to have the corner of Fulton Street and St. James Place, near Wallace's childhood home renamed in his honor, garnering support from local businesses and attracting more than 560 signatures.

A large portrait of Wallace features prominently in the Netflix series Luke Cage, due to the fact that he served as muse for the creation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's version of Marvel Comics character Cornell ""Cottonmouth"" Stokes. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Notorious+B.I.G."">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

134,inkonnu,5663,283558,"Ahmed Allali aléas Inkonnu est un rappeur populaire dans le sens noble du terme. La scène marocaine l’a découvert en 2015 dans A6 Gang, ensuite il a choisi de se lancer une carrière en solo. Son image est construite sur le mystère, il laisse donc son talent parle de lui.

Comme son nom l’indique, il est étranger par son RAP et bien encore il se considère un Alien, un extraterrestre. Pour ses fans, il suffit de prononcer le mot Alien afin que tout le monde se manifeste. Ce mot devient la clé d’appartenance à une communauté des jeunes doués et différents des autres, une jeunesse dont le caractère introvertis mais talentueuse quand même. Ceux qui trouvent de l’art dans les petits détails, ils s’expriment autrement et ils sont se projettent en tant que visionnaires, à vrai dire aussi qu’ils parlent la même langue mais pas avec les mêmes mots.

C’est le cas pour le fils sage de Bourgogne, il produit ses morceaux dans son coin. Chez lui, il n’y a pas de quête de starification. Il n’a fait que quelques interviews dans sa carrière, alors qu’il pourrait propulser son rap à un autre niveau en enchaînant ses sorties médiatiques.

Sa discographie, cumulant un EP Alien, un LP : Arabi et plusieurs d’autres tubes, fait preuve de créativité, dont la pièce maîtresse est KNZ (trésor). Ce dernier représente clairement l’univers de notre artiste, grâce à une bonne direction artistique l’Inko a pu révéler à 100% l’Alien dans ce clip. Toujours dans la discrétion, sa participation dans le projet Safar à travers Mardi à Casablanca en featuring avec Jok’air a marqué l’album collectif.

Un Alien né sur la terre !

Sa sincérité à toute épreuve fait son succès, elle l’aide à se débarrasser d’un entourage de mauvaise foi. Il s’élève par ses flows et ses paroles, on dirait qu’il vient d’une autre planète “Il me trouve un Alien parle en Darija”. Il brille par sa technique, on sent qu’il prend du plaisir à structurer ses textes.

“Tout le monde le sait, tous les rappeurs marocains l’avouent; L’Inko est un phénomène” Le producteur West lors de son passage à binatna sur Medi1 Tv. 7liwa l’a confirmé dans plusieurs occasions (les deux étaient membres de Zawa city en compagnie de Toto, drizzy, 7ari, Wind…). Les rappeurs se sont dits qu’ils devaient enchaîner, parce que l’Inko a mis la barre très haute, notamment au niveau de la création des flows.

Nous vous assurons qu’il est entouré maintenant par une team qui veille sur l’accomplissement de son art. L’album Arabi est programmé pour le mois de Décembre, s’affranchit de tous les codes musicaux, dans ses morceaux, comme dans ses flows et le premier extrait qui porte le même nom de l’album confirme nos paroles. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Inkonnu"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

136,papa roach,3227605,104492551,"Papa Roach is an American rock band from Vacaville, California, formed in 1993. The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist Jacoby Shaddix, guitarist Jerry Horton, drummer Dave Buckner, bassist Will James, and trombonist Ben Luther.

After two EPs, James left and was replaced by Tobin Esperance. The band independently released two more EPs before signing with DreamWorks Records in 1999, subsequently releasing the triple-platinum Infest in 2000, the gold album Lovehatetragedy in 2002 and the platinum album Getting Away with Murder in 2004. A year after The Paramour Sessions, Buckner left in 2007, and was replaced by Tony Palermo. Papa Roach then made Metamorphosis (2009), Time for Annihilation (2010), The Connection (2012), F.E.A.R. (2015), Crooked Teeth (2017) and Who Do You Trust? (2019). The group's eleventh studio album, Ego Trip, was released on April 8, 2022.

Papa Roach's formation began in January 1993, when lead singer Jacoby Shaddix and drummer Dave Buckner met on the Vacaville High School football field. They were later joined by lead guitarist Jerry Horton from nearby Vanden High School, rhythm guitarist Anne Mikolajcik, trombonist Ben Luther and bassist Will James. They decided to enter the school's talent show, performing a version of Jimi Hendrix's song ""Fire"". They ultimately ended up losing the talent show. In March 1993, Ben Luther left the band, and Anne Mikolajcik left as well. At this point, Papa Roach was practicing every day and touring, playing every gig it could get. The band's first tour van was called Moby Dick, from which Shaddix was inspired to come up with his first stage name ""Coby Dick"". Initially, the band was called ""Papa Gato"" as suggested by Buckner but Shaddix changed it to Papa Roach, mixing up the nickname of his grandfather from his mother's side —Herbert Fischer ""Papa""— and ""Roach"" coming from his grandfather from his father's side, John ""Grandpa"" Roatch. Both grandparents were musicians.

Papa Roach has been described as alternative rock, nu metal, alternative metal, rap metal, hard rock, rap rock, punk rock,  pop rock, and rapcore. The band also utilizes elements of pop, electronic, and hip hop. The band started as a hardcore punk band. In their early independent releases and on their first two major label albums, Infest and Lovehatetragedy, the band tended to use nu metal and rap metal. Before Papa Roach released their major label albums, Jacoby Shaddix's singing style was compared to Chino Moreno and Lynn Strait of Snot. Additionally, with their 2009 album, Metamorphosis, as the name expresses, the band felt that their music was going through a transformation to ""stuff that's...harder and faster"". AllMusic has compared the band's recent work to 1980s glam metal, Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote ""At the close of the 2000s, the quartet has shed the rap and the angst, ditching all the alt-metal accoutrements to become a knowing update of an '80s Sunset Strip sleaze rock outfit."" With the release of F.E.A.R., both MetalSucks and Metal Injection noted that the band has acquired some djent influences.

In 2004, frontman Jacoby Shaddix said the following in an interview with the Dallas Music Guide regarding the band no longer using rapping in their music: ""...the rapping's gone! I don't feel like rapping. I'm just over that...I just want to be a rocker. It's what I wanted to be when I was a kid"". Shaddix has added this remark in another interview: ""We're a band that tries to walk that line between metal, hardcore, punk rock and pop music, and we do our best at trying to make it all cool"".

Prior to the release of The Connection, guitarist Jerry Horton said in an interview by VerdamMnis Magazine that ""It's kind of a natural thing for us, we've always been changing throughout the years. Of course, there are some things that stay the same in our sound but we do like to try new things to sort of stretch out a little bit our basis and therefore make it more interesting"". He also said that the band was going to explore ""electronic sounds for the next record"".

The band's influences include Faith No More, Social Distortion, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Wu-Tang Clan, Fugees, Refused, Queen, and Led Zeppelin. Jacoby Shaddix acknowledges Faith No More's Mike Patton and Social Distortion's Mike Ness as major influences, stating that ""the way that I sing, I definitely was inspired by Mike Patton"", ""but I like the storytelling that Mike Ness does so I kind of fused both those two guys together at an early age, and it inspired me to become my own thing.""

In the beginning, Papa Roach's biggest influence was experimental band Mr. Bungle (fronted by Mike Patton from Faith No More), which was reflected in the adventurousness of their 1994 debut release Potatoes for Christmas.

In a 2021 interview, Jacoby Shaddix reflected about the band's long-held association with the nu metal genre, saying ""I love being one of the forefathers of nu metal, that's dope, but we've been able to outlive it and celebrate it at the same time"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Papa+Roach"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

140,1nonly,532974,22967326,"Nathan Scott Fuller (April 6, 2004) known by his stage name 1NONLY is an Korean-American singer, rapper and songwriter born in Las Vegas, Nevada. He is best acknowledged for his hit single ''Stay With Me'' accumulating over 300 million streams on Spotify. His primary genre of music is considered ''Aesthetic Rap'', however his initial start of his musical career started with the production of ""Bedroom Pop"" & ""Lo-Fi"" generating songs such as ""Forever In Love"", ""Sorry, I Like You"", ""I Fell In Love With You One Night In June"" & ""Pretty Girl"". 

Born in Las Vegas, Nevada, 1nonly first dabbled in Garageband in music class, often for fun without any real serious intent. However, 1nonly's first known song, Forever in Love, would be first uploaded to Soundcloud on the 16th of January, 2019. This sparked the production of his Bedroom Pop genre of music. However, his very first song, Clear Skies was published in 2018 and was emo rap. His songs were regarding love and delicate emotions, often ran by a lofi-style hip-hop beat. This genre of music would continue, with small differences such as the addition of stronger bass and percussion until the 18th of June, 2020, as the release of ""Doc Martens"" would be the song that kickstarts his now present day genre of Aesthetic Rap. This new wave of rap, wouldn't have been popularised and formed without 1nonly's own inspirations of Lil Peep, $not and many other artists that helped shaped this new genre. 

After realising the success Doc Martens received, he would later on the 15th of August, release, now a widely recognized song, Bunny Girl. This song was a massive success, receiving over tens of millions of streams across a multitude of platforms, and he would later upload an official music video to part with the song to YouTube. He continued to stick with the Aesthetic Rap genre and would go on to make memorable songs such as ""Shakira!"", ""Lovely"", ""Fuck You!"" etc. On the 11th of October, 2020, 1nonly would go onto to release his new song ""Stay with Me"". This song would reach records he had not achieved, and by date of creation has amassed over 150+ million streams on Spotify, causing it to go platinum. His unique style of lyrics and use of TikTok famous songs as sample truly secures an devoted audience. He would eventually be exclusively signed to Warner Records.

1nonly is known for collaborating with many artists, to name, Lilbubblegum, Shady Moon, Ciscaux and other popular underground artists such as Freddie Dredd and Jasiah. He has also been featured on Softwilly's YouTube channel in their video ""We made a BANGER album on discord"", and sang on ILY BABY - 1NONLY x SHADYMOON x VOID x LARRY and CHROME BERETTA (ft. Satori Zoom, Void, & Lex Pain). He is currently part of the rap collective ""The World Is Yours"". 1nonly's most notable producers are Nategoyard, $UPREME, and Shenrxn.

As of lately, 1nonly has changed his style of making music, focusing on shaping his own sound and moving away from the Aesthetic Rap genre. His other biggest hit, ""Step Back!"" featuring SXMPRA, a Phonk rap type beat that has amassed over 100 million streams, with the song blowing up on Tiktok and a music video published onto Youtube. This goes to show his versatility in his art and the switch up on his sound in which was carried over from his music he made in 2020-2021. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/1NONLY"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

144,limp bizkit,3406597,126698019,"Limp Bizkit is an American nu metal band from Jacksonville, Florida. Their lineup consists of Fred Durst (lead vocals), Sam Rivers (bass, backing vocals), John Otto (drums, percussion), DJ Lethal (turntables), and Wes Borland (guitars, vocals). Their music is marked by Durst's angry vocal delivery and Borland's sonic experimentation. Borland's elaborate visual appearance, which includes face and body paint, masks and uniforms, also plays a large role in the band's live shows. The band has been nominated for three Grammy Awards, have sold 40 million records worldwide and won several other awards.

Formed in 1994, Limp Bizkit became popular playing in the Jacksonville underground music scene in the late 1990s, and signed with Flip Records, a subsidiary of Interscope, which released their debut album, Three Dollar Bill, Yall$ (1997). The band achieved mainstream success with their second and third studio albums, Significant Other (1999) and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000), although this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding their performances at Woodstock '99 and the 2001 Big Day Out festival.

Shortly after the release of Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, Limp Bizkit went on a hiatus while Fred Durst recovered from being crucified by Slipknot. Borland left the group in 2001, but Durst, Rivers, Otto and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist Mike Smith. Following the release of their album, Results May Vary (2003), Borland rejoined the band and recorded The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal and drummer Sammy Siegler before entering a hiatus. In 2009, the band reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album Gold Cobra (2011), after which they left Interscope and later signed with Cash Money Records. In 2014, a sixth studio album, Stampede of the Disco Elephants, was to be released but remained in development hell. Eventually, a new album called Still Sucks was recorded with all of the original band members and released digitally only in October 2021. 

Fred Durst grew up in Jacksonville, where he took an interest in breakdancing, hip hop, punk rock and heavy metal. He began to rap, skate, beatbox and deejay. While mowing lawns and working as a tattoo artist, he developed an idea for a band that combined elements of rock and hip hop. Durst played with three other bands, Split 26, Malachi Sage, which were unsuccessful, and 10 Foot Shindig, which Durst left to form a new band. Durst told Sam Rivers, the bassist for Malachi Sage, ""You need to quit this band and start a band with me that's like this: rappin' and rockin'."" Rivers suggested that his cousin, John Otto, who was studying jazz drumming at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts and playing in local avant garde bands, become their drummer. Durst, Rivers and Otto jammed and wrote three songs together, and Wes Borland later joined as a guitarist.

Durst named the band Limp Bizkit because he wanted a name that would repel listeners. According to Durst, ""The name is there to turn people's heads away. A lot of people pick up the disc and go, 'Limp Bizkit. Oh, they must suck.' Those are the people that we don't even want listening to our music."" Other names that were considered by Durst included Gimp Disco, Split Dickslit, Bitch Piglet, and Blood Fart. Every record label that showed an interest in the band pressured its members to change its name. Limp Bizkit developed a cult following in the underground music scene, particularly at the Milk Bar, an underground punk club in Jacksonville. The band's local popularity was such that Sugar Ray, who had a major label contract, opened for a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit at Velocity with hip hop group Funkdoobiest. Milkbar owner, Danny Wimmer, stated that Limp Bizkit ""had the biggest draw for a local band. They went from playing [for] ten people to eight hundred within months. Fred ... was always marketing the band. He would go to record stores and get people involved, he was in touch with high schools."" However, the band knew that to achieve national success, they would have to distinguish themselves in their live performances. Attracting crowds by word of mouth, the band gave energetic live performances, covering George Michael's ""Faith"" and Paula Abdul's ""Straight Up"", and featuring Borland in bizarre costumes. Borland's theatrical rock style was the primary attraction for many concert attendees. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Limp+Bizkit"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He first got his buzz from ""No Chorus Pt. 3,"" a song and video from his crew Shotta Fam on which Choppa kicks off the song off and steals the show.
Since it's release in early January, NLE Choppa's ""Shotta Flow"" video has amassed more than 12 million views in nearly six weeks. The visual for his breakout record shows a precocious youth who is just as adept at dancing as he is at swinging choppas.

His flows and stylistic choices recall his friend and fellow hometown rapper BlocBoy JB. Yet Choppa is unique. His intensity, voice and dark sense of humor set him apart from the fray. His follow-up record, ""Shotta Flow 2,"" is approaching 2 million views in under a week.

Always business-savvy, Choppa turned down a $3 million dollar deal and opted for a partnership with UnitedMasters, a company that distributes his music while allowing him to keep his masters. With an EP coming in the spring and more videos on the way, the young artist's name is everywhere, even catching the attention of legendary rap mogul Birdman, who he's been spotted sharing studio time with. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/NLE+Choppa"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

152,dada,77617,671936,"There are at least six artists that use the name Dada: a '90s USA rock band, an English dance artist named Matti Schwartz, a '70s Japanese electronic band, and a short-lived Jazz-fusion band in 1970, MC/producer and Lithuanian rapper/

(1) Dada - USA rock band:
 
In 1992, Dada exploded on the scene with their critically acclaimed debut release Puzzle on Miles Copeland’s now defunct IRS Records. The single ""Dizz Knee Land"" set the alternative radio movement - just then hitting its stride - on fire, and quickly migrated to mainstream rock and pop stations. Puzzle sold over a half million copies and made a number of critics' ""best of year"" lists. September 1994 saw the release of American Highway Flower which had a harder feel both musically and lyrically than its predecessor, reflecting the band's evolution from a studio to a touring band. 

Money problems at IRS cut short promotional efforts in February 1995. Dada fared no better commercially with their third release - El Subliminoso in April 1996 - than they had with earlier releases. IRS Records was on its last legs by this time, and folded just as the band was winding up the first leg of the album tour. The exquisite El Subliminoso was perhaps the group's most artistically complex and satisfying offering.

The band signed to MCA Records in 1997, and released their self-titled fourth CD dada. This CD received favorable reviews, as did a 33-city headlining US tour. As the band was in mid-tour to promote the album however, MCA’s parent company was sold, leading to wholesale roster changes at the label. 

From June 1999 until March 2003, Dada was on a self-imposed hiatus. During this time, Michael Gurley and Phil Leavitt went on to form the critically acclaimed Butterfly Jones, Leavitt performed regularly with The Blue Man Group and Joie Calio began working as an A&R scout for MCA, wrote a book & recorded and released his solo debut CD, The Complications of Glitter.

March 2004 brought the release of the band’s fifth studio effort, [i/]How To Be Found. This album is an infectious collection of songs that is classic Dada: smart, sharp lyrics, undeniable melodies and incredible musicianship.

(2) Dada - Matti Schwartz, English dance artist

We’re not sure how many - if any - pre-surrealist art movements from the early 20th century have impacted on the world’s club scene, but the Dada movement’s aesthetic carries through to this cheeky, funk-fuelled slab of prime electro-house. ‘Lollipop’ is the work of Matti Schwartz, formerly of chart-toppers Deepest Blue and The Drill, and the production genius who can count Massive Attack, and many more, as past projects. Super-cool girl Trix, from hotly tipped electro-punk band, LIPS, is joined on vocals by dance legend, Sandy Rivera (of Kings Of Tomorrow fame and the producer of the house anthem, ‘Finally’).

‘Lollipop’ began life as an instrumental. Sandy, who was working next door to Matt’s studio, heard the track by chance: ""It sounded amazing.  It had a really sexy vibe and I thought it could use some dirty, tricky vocals with my style on it. Earlier I was listening to some of Trix's songs and asked Matt if she wanted to do the Lollipop thing with me. So I laid down the lyrics and Trix added her lines in later. There is something about lickin' ice cream that fits me nicely…"" Less than a week later and the new vocal version was on a bike to Radio 1 for it’s first play. The rest, as they say, is about to become history. Remixes come from Jerry Ropero, Nic Fanciulli, Breese & Bad Hand, The Drill & Andy Daniell.

(3) Dada - Kenji Konishi and Mutsuhiko Izumi:

Drawing inspiration from German electronic music, Fripp & Eno and Heldon, Dada (Kenji Konishi and Mutsuhiko Izumi) infused synth and guitar driven sounds with gagaku-inspired drones to achieve a sort of Oriental lyricism. The band subsequently released the album DADA (King '81) before splitting. Meanwhile, Konishi formed 4D, shifting his direction towards techno dance music, while Izumi joined the jazz-rock group Kennedy, and later After Dinner.

(4) Dada - jazz-fusion band

 In 1970 Elkie Brooks was persuaded by husband Pete Gage to join the jazz-fusion rock band Dada, and shared vocals with Paul Korda on their only album, called Dada, released by the Atlantic Records subsidiary label Atco.  Her next step was to join Vinegar Joe.

(5) Dada - MC and producer:

Born in the year 1983 in Novi Sad, but in the year 2000 he moves to Belgrade, where he still lives and works. He started his career in hip hop music in the year '98-'99 with a group called Fantomz,but a year later he starts his own solo career. Dada appeared on several hip hop compilations and rap albums. He also collaborated with many known and unknown names in serbian hip hop as an MC, as well as a producer.

Debut album called ""Dzepovi U Rukama"" (Pockets in hands) is scheduled for november/december 2009/10/11. Debut mixtape called ""Radio Ubica Decijega Lica"" (Radio Killer With Baby Face) is dropped late december 2009.

In 2015, at age 19, Lil Baby went to prison for two years for a probation violation. Upon his release in 2017, he jump-started his rap career with a mixtape called Perfect Timing, released in April of that year. The mixtape featured cameos from friends like Lil Yachty, Young Thug, and Gunna, and strong production from 808 Mafia, Brickz, and many others, highlighted by Lil Baby's woozy flows. The mixtape immediately brought the young rapper fame, in part due to his affiliations with friends in the Quality Control family of artists as well as the 4 Pockets Full clique. As his mixtape attracted more listeners, Lil Baby worked constantly on new music, releasing singles like ""My Dawg"" and the Young Thug collaboration ""Pink Slip"""" in the summer of 2017. Other 2017 releases included Harder Than Hard, 2 the Hard Way (with Marlo), and Too Hard. Lil Baby's debut studio album, Harder Than Ever, appeared in May of 2018.

165,the alchemist,1187139,37919360,"Alan Daniel Maman (born October 25, 1977), better known as The Alchemist, is a hip-hop producer and MC. The Alchemist has been an active producer since 1991. He hails from affluent Beverly Hills, California. After rising to prominence in the late 1990s as a close associate of Dilated Peoples, he went on to produce for many of hip-hop's leading artists in the 2000s.

As a teen, Al began to identify strongly with the rebellious lyrics and urban sounds of hip-hop, and he began writing his own lyrics as a creative outlet. He joined up with other like-minded artists who wrote lyrics and rebelled strongly against their ""uptight"" suburban surroundings, among whom were Shifty Shellshock of Crazy Town, Evidence of Dilated Peoples and Scott Caan, son of James Caan. They would often hang out in urban areas of Los Angeles and participated in typical teenage rebellious activities like partying, smoking marijuana, and general mischief.

Al and Scott decided to become a duo named The Whooliganz. While rhyming at a party in L.A., they attracted the attention of B-Real of Cypress Hill. He invited the teens to join his crew, The Soul Assassins, which also included the groups House of Pain and Funkdoobiest. In 1993, the Whooliganz released their first single, ""Put Your Handz Up."" The song received little radio airplay and their record label, Tommy Boy Records, decided to shelve their album. Rejected, Scott focused his creative energy on acting while Al became interested in process of making hip-hop beats.

DJ Muggs took Al under his wing and taught him how to use a sampler and mixing board. After helping to produce a few tracks for Cypress Hill, Al became the main producer for his childhood friend, Evidence and his group Dilated Peoples. When Dilated debuted in 1998, they were an underground sensation creating a huge buzz about the man behind those incredible beats.

In 1999, Muggs introduced Al to his good friends, the popular hip-hop group Mobb Deep. Al produced two songs for their Murda Muzik album. Impressed by his production skills and street smarts, Mobb Deep took him under their wing, using his beats on all their subsequent albums. As Alchemist's profile increased, he went on to produce for many of hip hop's most successful and prominent artists, such as Nas, Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Ghostface Killah and Snoop Dogg. He has also remixed songs for bands and artists in other genres such as Linkin Park and Morcheeba. Al stayed loyal to his old friends, continuing to produce for Dilated, Cypress Hill, Everlast (formerly of House of Pain) and Crazy Town. He also enjoys producing for lesser-known underground rappers, often giving them some of his best beats. In 2004, 11 years after his rapping career folded, The Alchemist returned with his long-awaited debut album, ""1st Infantry."" The album yielded the hit single ""Hold You Down"" (featuring Prodigy, Illa Ghee, and Nina Sky), which hit number ninety-five on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2005.

Alchemist was the official tour DJ for Eminem on his 2005 Anger Management 3 Tour, replacing the recently-ousted DJ Green Lantern. However on July 13, 2005, the tour bus carrying Eminem's entourage (including rapper Stat Quo as well as Alchemist) swerved off the road and turned over. Alchemist was treated for broken ribs and a collapsed lung.

The Alchemist is one of the music producers behind the video game Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars released by Rockstar Games. He was also on Tim Westwood TV, when Eminem, Royce Da 5'9"" and Mr. Porter freestyled. During an interview with Worldwide Conspiracy Radio, The Alchemist revealed he would be dropping a 2-part project with fellow West Coast producer Oh No entitled Gangrene, the first to be released in July, the second in November, both on Decon. Alchemist was also the DJ for the Eminem set on the BBC1 chat-show Jonathan Ross on June 4, 2010.

Alchemist is Eminem's official DJ, since DJ Green Lantern departed from Shady Records in 2005 because of a dispute related to the feud of 50 Cent and Jadakiss. In 2006, Eminem released a collaboration album with Shady Records called Eminem Presents: The Re-Up. Since the Alchemist is his official DJ, he produced some of the tracks on the mixtape, as well as compiling the album in a mixtape fashion. On December 18, 2013, he was named the runner-up for Producer of the Year by HipHopDX. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Alchemist"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

1.  A Moroccan female Pop/R&B/hip-hop vocalist, originally from Kalaat Sraghna, Manal grew up in Marrakesh where she studied business and finance. Having always wanted to be a musical artist, she posted covers on YouTube and was discovered by Hamza Ait Khali, the partner of Moroccan producer DJ Van.

After a short stint with DJ Van's label Magic Castle Entertainment and the release of her debut single Denia, which earned her the 'Best Female Artist in Northern Africa' award at the Africa Music Awards in 2015, she switched management to Tarik Azzougarh, better known as Cilvaringz, producer and conceptualizer of the world's most expensive musical work ever sold, Wu-Tang Clan's Once Upon A Time in Shaolin.

Manal followed up her debut single with her song Koulchi Ban, the last song she would do with DJ Van. The release of Koulchi Ban received critical acclaim from fans and sparked the interest of Sony Music Middle East. In October 2017, Manal became one of the first Moroccan artists to sign to a major label in the Arab world.

In February 2018, Manal released her third single Taj (Crown). Due to its music video and a significant departure from Manal's signature sound, Taj started a buzz and garnered millions of views quickly. It is one of the most viewed Arabic rap songs performed by a female artist. After Taj, Manal released the song Nah featuring Moroccan rap duo Shayfeen and then had one of her biggest singles to date, Slay, in collaboration with ElGrandeToto.

In November 2019, Manal signed a distribution deal with RCA Records, a division of Sony Music France, through her record company Bench & Guess Entertainment.

Currently, she is under an exclusive license agreement with the same label, and under a music publishing agreement with Universal Music Publishing.

Manal's current management team includes Anissa Jalab, former manager of Belgian rapper Damso, head of Wagram Belgium, and also manager of ElGrandeToto.

In May 2021, Manal released her first album entitled 360, which included the hit single Niya.

Deprived of the stage during the COVID-19 pandemic, she launched, with the help of her husband Moncef Guessous, a streetwear brand called Bari & Soch.

In November 2021, Manal earned the 'Best Female Artist in Northern Africa' award at the 2021 All Africa Music Awards for the second time in her career.

In May 2022, Manal performed ""3ARI"" for COLORS. In October 2022, she was chosen to feature in Light The Sky, a song for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, collaborating with artists, RedOne, Balqees, Rahma Riad and Nora Fatehi.


2. Manal was a blues band from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

195,lil durk,906920,51452219,"Durk Derrick Banks (born October 19, 1992), better known as Lil Durk, is a rapper, singer, and songwriter from Chicago, Illinois. Durk is best known for his involvement in the drill wave that took the music world by storm in the 2010s. He is the founder of his own record label, Only the Family (OTF).

Durk’s early career was, like many drill artists, plagued with legal issues and accusations of violence. These issues eventually led to his shows being canceled.

In 2012, his career took off with the release of “L’s Anthem” and its French Montana-featuring remix. In 2013, he continued his hot streak with “Dis Ain’t What U Want,” a conscious reflection on his perception in the media and throughout his city. In 2015, he released his debut studio album Remember My Name and the viral sensation, “My Beyoncé” with DeJ Loaf.

Between 2016 and 2020, Durk went on to drop several new installments of his series Signed to the Streets and Just Cause Y’all Waited. At the same time, he faced renewed legal challenges stemming from an Atlanta shooting. Regardless of the circumstances, he persisted, gaining yet another viral hit as a feature on Drake’s “Laugh Now Cry Later.” He also gained traction with the Lil Baby and Polo G assisted “3 Headed Goat.”

The scars of violence run deep in Durk’s discography, particularly stemming from the loss of OTF members Nunu (Nuski) and King Von at the hands of gunfire. Both artists are memorialized on his album The Voice, for which a deluxe version was released in 2021. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Durk"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Green's career began in 2018. He released several mixtapes independently prior to signing with Alamo Records. On June 14, 2019, he released his mixtape PTSD, which included the song ""Heart On Ice"".

Blessed with a special singing voice, and the knowledge of how best to use it, Florida's Rod Wave is taking his own path to the top of the game. Coming through with a soulful set of Southern sing-raps, Rod has developed a groundswell of regional support through a prolific output that includes 3 projects in the last 12 months. After generating millions of streams with breakout singles “Heart On Ice” and “Popular Loner,” both off June 2019’s PTSD project, Rod levels up with Ghetto Gospel, his new project. With heavy use of organic instrumentation, including snaking electric guitars and warm organ swells, Ghetto Gospel gives a proper title to Rod's spiritual and nakedly-emotional blend of rap music, defined by Rod's unique singing ability, able to switch from a bluesy croon to rapid-fire triplets at a moments notice. Featuring the popular new single ""Cuban Links,"" which features an appearance from Ghetto Gospel executive producer Kevin Gates, and the ""Heart On Ice"" (Remix), which features an appearance from Lil Durk, Ghetto Gospel is available everywhere.

Recently Rod Wave was arrested and his height was exposed (5'6 and weighing 350lbs/160kg). This means he has a BMI of 58 and puts him in the morbidly obese section of the BMI scale. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Rod+Wave"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

199,meek mill,1549535,39070700,"Robert Williams (born May 6, 1987), better known by his stage name Meek Mill, is an American rapper from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was briefly signed to T.I.'s label Grand Hustle Records and in February 2011 signed to Rick Ross' Maybach Music Group. He adopted the rap name “Meek Mill” after family and friends from his neighborhood kept referencing him by his middle name. Meek is coined as the latest rap phenomenon to come out of the city of Philadelphia.

Raised in the North Philadelphia section of the city with his sister and inspired by his mother and father; who died when he was five, Meek Mill began taking the rap game seriously at the age of 12 after losing a street battle to neighboring rappers. He says his desire to rap grew after watching his uncle Philly hip-hop pioneer Grandmaster Nell. While hanging out in his neighborhood, Meek met three guys and formed the group, “BloodHoundz,” which consisted of Mel Love, Dat Nigga Leel and Young Pooh. The group lasted for fives years and Meek ventured on his own.

With a solo career in tow, Meek became one of Philadelphia’s hottest underground rap artists on an independent label. In 2007, Meek debuted his Flamerz series, which stands for hottest songs and released his first mix tape, Flamerz 1, which featured the hit single, “In My Bag.”

In 2008, Meek debuted the highly anticipated Flamerz 2 –“Hottest In Da City,” which showcased more of his lyrical abilities with the singles, “So Fly,” “Prolli,” and “Hottest In Da City.” Upon release of Flamerz 2, it caught the attention of founder and President of 215Aphillyated Records, Charlie Mack. Mack was immediately impressed with Meek that he signed him to his management company. During the same year, he met the founder and owner of Grand Hustle, TI. TI was impressed with his lyrical ability that he offered him an opportunity to travel to Los Angeles to meet with him along with the Warner Brothers Records, within one week both record companies offered him a deal. Meek was overwhelmed by the offers; however, he felt collaborating with TI was an opportunity of a lifetime and chose his label. An ecstatic Meek was on top of the world; a record deal and the chance to work with one of hip hop’s greatest rappers and then a set back occurred. He was arrested, charged with a crime and order to serve seven months in jail.

Meek pre-released three singles from his third mix tape Flamerz 2.5 – “The Preview” in August of 2009, which featured the chart topping hits, “Make ‘Em Say,” “Imma Da Ish,” featuring Ms. Jade and “Starting Something,” in honor Michael Jackson. Within the first two weeks of its release, Clear Channel added it to their play list, which is an anomaly in the music business. In June of 2009, Meek began immediately working on his freshman album – Flamerz 3, “Hottest In America – Gangster Grill Edition,” hosted by DJ Drama and featuring the songs: “Baby Girl,” “Hottest In America,” and “I’m Killinem.” The highly anticipated cd is set to be released on January 19, 2010. Despite his stint in jail, Meek’s fans remained loyal, he currently boasts of 13 million hits on My Space and 20 million viewers on You Tube. Meek Mill has recently just signed to Rick Ross's Maybach Music Group.

In the future, Meek plans to establish the Meek Mill Foundation, which will mentor young males between the ages of 12-24 on the importance of “Education over Incarceration.” He gives a shoutout to the next artist coming up named shizz.. He also plans to collaborate with United Community Action Network and the Lifers of Graterford Prison to address the violence plaguing our cities.

2015 - BEEF WITH DRAKE
In July 2015 Meek attempted to air out Drake for ""not writing his own raps"" via popular social media site Twitter. These tweets resulted in a huge reaction from the hip hop community, however, the stunt went awry when Drake (Aubrey Graham) decided to respond. Drake released the diss track ""Charged Up"" during an Apple Music stream and an immediate response from Meek was demanded. Funkmaster Flex announced he would debut Meek's response live on Hot97. However, the track never came. After four days there was still no sign of a response from Meek, prompting Drake to release a second diss track ""Back To Back."" The response to this was huge and a harsh blow to Meek's career. Two days later Meek finally released ""Wanna Know."" This track received largely negative reviews and it was clear to most that Drake had won the beef. On August 2nd at the annual OVOfest, Drake truly roasted Meek Mill; performing ""Back To Back"" in front of various memes poking fun at Meek to a raucous Toronto crowd. Many fans believed this to be the nail in the coffin spelling the end for Meek's career.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Meek+Mill"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
