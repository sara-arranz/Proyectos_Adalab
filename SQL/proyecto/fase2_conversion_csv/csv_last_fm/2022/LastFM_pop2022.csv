10,harry styles,2679748,331057273,"Harry Edward Styles (born 1 February 1994 in Redditch, Worcestershire, England) is a three-time GRAMMY award-winning, British singer, songwriter, and actor. As a member of the British/Irish boy band One Direction, singer Harry Styles topped the charts, toured the world, and sold millions of albums before going solo in 2016. Styles was raised in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, and he made his first foray into music with a high-school band named White Eskimo. In 2010, he left home and joined the seventh season of The X Factor, where fate and Simon Cowell would eventually lead him toward a life-changing opportunity with four other young men. As One Direction, Styles and his group mates Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, and Liam Payne would release five albums from 2011 to 2015, hitting number one across the globe and selling millions of records to an adoring and rabid fan base that drew comparisons to the fervor at the height of Beatlemania. In early 2016, after Malik had already parted ways with 1D, the remaining foursome announced their indefinite hiatus.

Months later, Styles signed a solo deal with Columbia Records. Reflecting the influence of childhood favorites like Queen, Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, The Rolling Stones, Freddy Mercury, and The Beatles, Styles' solo material took a more serious and rock-based approach, while still delivering the pop sound his faithful 1D fans desired. With the help of Grammy-winning producer Jeff Bhasker (who had worked with Kanye West and Bruno Mars), Styles put together a small band and, after rehearsing the songs, headed to Jamaica for two months to record an album. ""Sign of the Times"", a plaintive ballad, was released as its first single in April 2017. The self-titled full-length album Harry Styles followed in May and debuted at the top of the Billboard 200. After two world tours, Harry set to write his sophomore album Fine Line, releasing the hit songs ""Lights Up"",  ""Watermelon Sugar"" and ""Adore You"" as the singles.

Fine Line was released on 13 December 2019 by Columbia and Erskine Records. On March 14, 2021, Harry received the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance for ""Watermelon Sugar"" at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. He was also nominated for Best Music Video with ""Adore You"" and for Best Pop Vocal Album for his ""Fine Line"" album. In May of the same year, Styles also won the Brit Award for British Single for ""Watermelon Sugar"". 

On May 20, 2022, Styles released his third studio album, titled  Harry’s House.

14,sebastian yatra,531346,11586069,"Sebastián Obando Giraldo (born 15 October 1994), known professionally as Sebastián Yatra, is a Colombian singer and songwriter. He began as a Latin pop artist and has recorded many ballads, but has released several successful reggaeton singles. Yatra is noted for his romantic lyrics, melding traditional lyricism with modern reggaeton influences. He rose to prominence in Latin America in 2016 when he released the hit ""Traicionera"". He has released three studio albums and recorded with artists from a diverse range of musical genres throughout his career.

Born in Medellín and raised primarily in Miami, Yatra began singing at a young age and returned to Colombia to begin his musical career. He achieved breakout success with ""Traicionera"" followed by ""Robarte un Beso"" featuring Carlos Vives. ""Traicionera"" served as the lead single for his 2018 debut album, Mantra, which also featured the single ""Sutra"", featuring Puerto Rican rapper Dalmata. He then released the album Fantasia including the lead single ""Un Año"" featuring Mexican band Reik. He received continued success collaborating with Daddy Yankee, Natti Natasha, and the Jonas Brothers on the bilingual single ""Runaway"".

Yatra's music has been classified as Latin pop, reggaeton, and ballads. According to The Fader, Yatras music lands ""somewhere in between the olden times’ sappy romantics and the new wave’s sensuous vibras.""He is influenced by Latin pop and reggaeton artists Ricky Martin, J Balvin, Juanes, and Reik. In an interview with Billboard, he expressed a desire to collaborate with Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli. Yatra believes that contemporary musicians commit an ""error in associating ballads with boring and slow and old"", and hopes to rejuvenate intererest in ballads for a younger audience.However, his music contains elements of other genres; Desire Thompson of Vibe described his song ""Traicionera"" as a ""trap-EDM blend"".

Despite growing up in Florida and being fluent in English, Yatra sings almost exclusively in Spanish. Yatra explains, “My goal was always to be a singer in Spanish. And I really wanted to understand where I come from and live it. A lot of times I went to Colombia and, even though I spoke Spanish and was always speaking Spanish with my parents, I still felt like an outsider. I wasn’t 100 percent part of it. I wanted to give my roots the importance they deserve. ”His June 2019 song ""Runaway"" was his first foray into bilingual songwriting. In December 2019, he collaborated with South Korean boy group Monsta X for the song ""Magnetic"", which features verses from Yatra in Spanish and a bridge from Monsta X in Spanglish.

Alborán is the son of Spanish architect Salvador Moreno de Alborán Peralta and French Elena Ferrándiz Martínez. He is also the great-grandson of Francisco Moreno Fernández, 1st Marquess of Alborán, and has two siblings: Casilda and Salvador.

From a very young age, he was interested in learning to play various musical instruments such as piano, classical guitar, flamenco guitar, and acoustic guitar, and attended singing lessons with professional artists in Málaga and Madrid. In 2002, at the age of 12, he composed his first songs, ""Amor de Barrio"" (Neighbourhood Love) and ""Desencuentro"" (Disagreement) which would be featured 10 years later on his debut album.

In Málaga he performed for the first time with a Flamenco band in a restaurant, and he was nicknamed El Blanco Moreno (The White Moreno), because he ""was very pale-skinned and Moreno was my family name"", as he stated in an interview in early 2011. Later, Pablo met producer Manuel Illán and recorded a demo, which included a cover of ""Deja de Volverme Loca"" (Stop Driving Me Crazy) by Diana Navarro. Upon hearing this recording, Navarro expressed great interest in Alborán and became his musical mentor.

In preparation for his first album, Alborán composed a total of 40 songs from which the playlist would be selected. During the recording of this studio album, Pablo Alborán, he uploaded a few songs on YouTube, which gained the attention of many, including singer Kelly Rowland who was amazed by his voice, as far as saying ""I'm in love with Pablo Alboran!"". His videos have since received millions of views.

""Solamente Tú"" (Only You) was digitally released in Spain in October 2010 as the first single of his debut album, which was released in February 2011. Both the single and the album were a huge success, managing to top the Spanish music charts for several consecutive weeks. The album won multiple awards, including 2011 RTVE's Album of the Year, and became Spain's best-selling album in 2011.

Alborán began his first world tour on May 27, 2011 in Madrid at the Palacio Vistalegre, and has since performed in many Latin American countries, among which are Argentina, Chile and Mexico. Following his success, he released his first live album, En Acústico, in November of the same year. It included acoustic versions of most of the tracks in his debut album, as well as two new songs and four bonus tracks. The song ""Perdóname"" (Forgive Me) was re-recorded featuring Portuguese singer Carminho, and was released as the first single of the album, peaking at number one on the Spanish singles chart on November 13, 2011, thus helping En Acústico to debut also at number one on the albums chart one week later, on November 20, 2011, and to top the Portuguese Albums Chart in January 2012.

In December 19, 2011, Alborán received the 2011 Best New Act award in Los Premios 40 Principales. Both his albums Pablo Alborán and En Acústico were featured in Spain's official list of top-selling albums of 2011, in numbers 1 and 6 respectively, and singles ""Solamente Tú"" and ""Perdóname"" were the third and nineteenth best-selling songs in Spain in 2011. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Pablo+Albor%C3%A1n"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

27,imagine dragons,3536673,209252811,"Imagine Dragons is a pop rock band which formed in 2008 in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. The band consists of Dan Reynolds (vocals), Wayne Sermon (guitar), Ben McKee (bass) and Daniel Platzman (drums). The band released four EPs - ""Imagine Dragons"" (2009), ""Hell and Silence"" (2010), ""It's Time"" (2011) and ""Continued Silence"" (2012) - before releasing their debut full length album ""Night Visions"" on 4 September 2012.

The band's single ""It's Time"", which previously appeared on the ""It's Time"" and ""Continued Silence"" EPs in addition to appearing on ""Night Visions"", is the group's biggest hit, reaching #33 on the Billboard Hot 100.

In a dark kitchen in the middle of a sweaty night in Las Vegas, all 6’4” of Dan Reynolds is hunched over a laptop, slapping beats on the table and crooning lyrics into a tiny microphone.  Before long, he and the other three members of pop rock band Imagine Dragons would be playing “It’s Time,” that same laptop-demo-turned-supersized-anthem, from the roof of a parking garage to a wave of thousands of screaming fans.  This song title to the single from their 2012 debut KidInaKorner/Interscope release “Continued Silence EP” is an all too apt descriptor of the band’s hard-earned success—but it’s also emblematic of the deep-seated anxiety Reynolds and the rest of the band experienced leaving behind any realistic expectation of a normal job to do the thing they love most. 

A third-generation Las Vegas native, Reynolds is no stranger to the adage “the house always wins,” choosing to pave his musical career with a near obsessive work ethic and hundreds of unused demos rather than roll the dice with the first songs that sprung from his mouth.  It’s no surprise, then, that he was drawn to guitarist Wayne Sermon, another founding member of Imagine Dragons.  Having practically grown up in a recording studio and graduated Berklee College of Music, Wayne had been practicing his guitar through meals and other socially inappropriate situations as long as he could remember; he challenged Dan in a way that was both uncomfortable and exactly what they both needed.  When they began writing songs together and recognized something special was happening, Wayne called up his Berklee friend Ben McKee, who promptly dropped out of school with only a few credits left, moving across the country to play bass for the band.  This sort of reckless/genius behavior is typical for Ben, who has an uncanny penchant for spicy food and a suitcase full of unbelievable road stories.  More recently, the band was joined by drummer Daniel Platzman, another Bostonian schoolmate who seems way too nice to be playing rock and roll until you actually see him in action.

Several tours and three self-released EPs later, Imagine Dragons had made a serious name for itself, particularly in the west coast circuit.  Although their songs vary from nearly whimsical and light to brooding and powerful, listeners are drawn to the inherent honesty in the music.  The only rule of thumb for the band, it seems, is to write from a true place; the result is songs that literally run the spectrum of human emotion.  Attend a concert, and it becomes clear that the live performance of deeply personal songs has a real effect on people.  And the band itself is not immune, as demonstrated when Dan literally passed out into the drum set during a finale song, sending cymbals and drum stands crashing while the rest of the band played on until the close.

Great songwriting is bound to be noticed eventually.  As proof that the harder you work, the luckier you get, one of those people who noticed was Grammy winning producer Alex da Kid (Eminem, Rihanna).  Alex and Dan began collaborating on projects, and soon the band had developed a relationship with Alex and his team.  The alchemy resulting from Alex’s hip hop sensibilities and Imagine Dragons’ anthemic rock is nothing short of explosive.  The byproduct of this creative collision is “Continued Silence,” a six song in-your-face sonic grenade that breaks musical boundaries and yet is strangely relatable by its improbably diverse audience. 

Despite it all, on any given day when they aren’t on the road playing shows, you can still find Imagine Dragons huddled away in a rehearsal room somewhere, banging out song after song in search of the next perfect track.  Like most things in Vegas, the band is angled at going big or going bust.  For the sake of those who love great music, we hope it’s the former. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Imagine+Dragons"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Trainor rose to prominence with her 2014 debut single ""All About That Bass"", which topped the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 for eight consecutive weeks and topped the charts in other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

At age 17, Trainor won the worldwide Sonicbids 2011 Tennessee Concerts Song Contest with her song ""You're Good With Me."" She also attended the Durango Songwriter's Expo and Big Al Anderson of NRBQ introduced her to Carla Wallace of Big Yellow Dog Music. Trainor signed as a songwriter with Big Yellow Dog Music shortly after her 18th birthday, while she was still in high school. In 2011, Trainor wrote and self-released two albums, I'll Sing With You and Only 17. She went on several writing trips to Los Angeles, New York City, and Nashville. She settled in Nashville full-time when she was 19. She has had songwriting cuts with Rascal Flatts, Sabrina Carpenter, R5, and many others.

On one of Trainor's writing trips, she met and wrote with Grammy-nominated producer Kevin Kadish.

In late 2002, after OneRepublic played shows throughout the Los Angeles area, several record labels approached the band with interest, but the band signed with Velvet Hammer, an imprint of Columbia Records. They made their first album with producer Greg Wells during the summer and fall of 2005 at his studio, Rocket Carousel, in Culver City, California. The album was scheduled for release on June 6, 2006, but the group was dropped by Columbia two months before the album was released. The lead single of that album, ""Apologize"", was released on April 30, 2006, on Myspace, eventually reaching number one on the Myspace charts.

In 2007, OneRepublic released their debut album, Dreaming Out Loud. Their lead single, ""Apologize"", was remixed by Timbaland, becoming a huge international success, reaching number one in sixteen countries and subsequently earning them a Grammy Award nomination. The second single, ""Stop and Stare"", mirrored its predecessor's success. The album was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The band's second album, Waking Up (2009), produced the singles ""All the Right Moves"", ""Secrets"", ""Marchin On"", and ""Good Life"", with the last reaching the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100.

OneRepublic's third album, Native (2013), became the band's first top ten album on the Billboard 200, and highest-charting album to date, charting at number four. The lead single, ""If I Lose Myself"", charted within the top ten in several countries, while the album's third single, ""Counting Stars"", became the band's most successful single in recent years, obtaining top-five placements in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, the US, and the UK. This marks their highest-charting single in the United Kingdom to date. It also peaked at number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, matching the group's highest peak of ""Apologize"" in 2007.

On October 7, 2016, OneRepublic released Oh My My, their fourth studio album, featuring several collaborators, including Cassius, Peter Gabriel, and Santigold. Preceded by the singles ""Wherever I Go"", released on May 13, 2016, and ""Kids"", released on August 12, 2016, it was recognized as a change in their sound from previous albums by critics and by the band. In 2017, the band released the singles ""No Vacancy"", ""Truth to Power"", ""Stranger Things"" with Kygo and ""Rich Love"" with Seeb. Their fifth studio album, Human, was released in 2021. The band has sold approximately over 16 million records worldwide.

On November 1, 2021, OneRepublic released the song ""Sunshine"". The song is used as the theme song to the 2021 film Clifford the Big Red Dog.

In February 2022, OneRepublic released the song ""West Coast"". The song is the lead single from OneRepublic’s upcoming sixth studio album. The song is an ode to the American state of California and evokes classic 1960s California sounds, stemming from groups such as The Beach Boys and The Mamas and the Papas, along with inspiration from Gorillaz. It has been both a band favorite and a fan favorite for a long time, and it ultimately became a tone-setter for their sixth studio effort. They first started working on “West Coast” during the production process of their 2016 album, Oh My My, but ended up shelving it for later. An earlier version of the song was used for U2’s 2017 hit, “Summer of Love,” which actually turned the original demo into an anti-war track.

After years of anticipation and re-tooling, the final version of “West Coast” was officially made public on February 25, 2022.

On April 1, 2022, OneRepublic released ""You Were Loved"" as a single with DJ and producer Gryffin. On May 13, 2022, the band released ""I Ain't Worried"", the second single from the soundtrack for the film Top Gun: Maverick. It will also be featured on their upcoming sixth studio album which is rumored to be released by the end of the summer. On January 31, 2023, Ryan Tedder confirmed in The Great Creators with Guy Raz that he will upload song teasers on social media, and let the public choose the next single.

OneRepublic's varied style of music has been described by Ryan Tedder: ""We're no respecter of genre. If it's a good song or a good artist whether rock, pop, indie or hip hop, they've probably influenced us on some level... nothing's new under the sun, we're a sum of a bunch of parts."" Specific artists whom OneRepublic has cited as influences include Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the Beatles, U2, M83, and Prince.

OneRepublic has won several music awards and landed many nominations, including for American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, World Music Awards, and Grammy Awards. Separately, lead singer Ryan Tedder has won three Grammy Awards due to his songwriting credits for Adele and Taylor Swift. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/OneRepublic"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

43,taylor swift,5041759,2866235756,"Taylor Alison Swift is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise.

Swift rose to mainstream prominence with her sophomore studio album, Fearless (2008), a country pop record with crossover appeal. Aided by the top-five singles “Love Story” and “You Belong with Me”, Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Swift's third studio album, Speak Now (2010), blended country pop with elements of rock and featured the top-ten singles “Mine” and “Back to December”.

Drawing inspiration from various pop, rock, and electronic genres, Swift's fourth studio album Red (2012) saw her transcending her country roots. She completely moved to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), and expanded the electropop sound on her next two studio albums, reputation (2017) and Lover (2019), which respectively embraced urban and retro styles. The four albums spawned a string of international top-five singles, including “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”, “I Knew You Were Trouble”, “Shake It Off”, “Blank Space”, “Bad Blood”, “Look What You Made Me Do”, “ME! (feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco)”, “You Need to Calm Down”, and “Lover”.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift experimented with folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums, folklore and evermore (both 2020), whose lead singles “cardigan” and “willow” topped charts around the world. She also released the critically acclaimed documentaries Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions that year. Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights (2022), marked her triumphant return to pop after two folk albums. The album set the record for biggest first day and first week ever on Spotify, spawned the hits Anti-Hero and Lavender Haze, and sold over 1.5 million copies in its first week becoming not only the biggest debut of the decade but also Swift's biggest debut ever. She would make history by becoming the first artist to occupy the entire top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 with tracks from Midnights.

Red (Taylor's Version) was a critical and commercial hit, and proved that Swift's ambitious, yet ongoing plan to re-record her first 6 albums was well worth it.

Along with the release of Red (Taylor's Version) came All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), Swift's filmmaking debut. The 15 minute romantic drama was based on the lyrical content from Swift's 2012 fan favorite “All Too Well” starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien.

44,camila cabello,1962458,102902552,"Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao (born March 3, 1997), known by her stage name Camila Cabello, is a Cuban-Mexican-American singer and songwriter. She is a Latin-influenced pop performer who first came to prominence as a founding member of the girl group Fifth Harmony. Born in Cojimar, Cuba, Cabello moved to Miami, Florida at the age of six. Growing up in a Spanish-speaking environment (born to a Cuban mother and Mexican father), she fostered her love of music by listening to Celia Cruz and Alejandro Fernández. At the age of 15, she auditioned for The X Factor in Greensboro, North Carolina. Even though she was eliminated (along with her four future groupmates), Simon Cowell recognized her talent and combined the girls to form the quintet girl group Fifth Harmony.

Despite finishing in third place, they went on to be the most successful contestants from that season. The group's debut EP, Better Together, was released in October 2013, with acoustic reworkings, Spanish versions (Juntos and Juntos Acoustic), and a remix album following a month later. Their debut single, ""Miss Movin' On,"" was the highest-charting U.S. X Factor single at the time, a feat beaten only by each successive Fifth Harmony single.

The group's debut LP, Reflection, was released in early 2015, featuring the hits ""Sledgehammer"" (written by Meghan Trainor) and ""Worth It,"" featuring rapper Kid Ink. While backstage on Taylor Swift's 1989 world tour, Cabello wrote a duet with Canadian singer/songwriter Shawn Mendes. ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was released in November 2015 and immediately hit the Billboard Top 20. Fifth Harmony's sophomore set, 7/27, was issued in 2016, supported by a world tour and the hit single ""Work from Home.""

Inspired to pursue her own creative endeavors, Cabello paired with rapper Machine Gun Kelly for the October 2016 single ""Bad Things."" Well received, the track made a slow climb toward the top of the Billboard singles chart, and ultimately garnered the singer her first Top Ten song as a solo artist. That December, Cabello announced her departure from Fifth Harmony. Following her exit, Cabello collaborated with Cashmere Cat on ""Love Incredible"" and Pitbull and J Balvin on ""Hey Ma"" from The Fate of the Furious soundtrack.

In May 2017, Cabello released her debut (non-album) solo single, the Sia Furler co-written ""Crying in the Club,"" which peaked in the Top 40 of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The promotional (non-album) single,""I Have Questions,"" was released a few days later. She also joined Bruno Mars as the opening act on his 24K Magic World Tour. New writing and recording sessions for her album were influenced by the success of her single ""Havana"" featuring Young Thug, which postponed its original release date and influenced the change of the record name from “The Hurting, The Healing, The Loving.” to “Camila.”

In early 2018, she returned with her debut full-length solo album, Camila, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. It featured production by Frank Dukes, Jarami, and others. Buoyed by the number one single ""Havana,"" featuring Young Thug, and ""Never Be the Same,"" the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.

In April 2018, Cabello embarked on the Never Be the Same Tour, her first as a solo artist. She was featured in ""Sangria Wine"", a song she recorded with Pharrell Williams. Cabello released the song live during her headlining tour. In May 2018, Cabello made a cameo appearance in Maroon 5's music video for ""Girls Like You"" featuring Cardi B.

Cabello was featured in the remix version of ""Beautiful"", a song from American singer Bazzi. The song was released on August 2. On October 9, 2018, Cabello released the video single, ""Consequences"", having first surprised 12 of her biggest fans in advance, with a ""Most Amazing Mystery Gift & Personal Letter"".

On June 21, 2019, Cabello released ""Señorita"" with Canadian singer Shawn Mendes, along with the music video.

49,the weeknd,4470383,825716775,"Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, popularly known as The Weeknd (born February 16, 1990 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), is a Canadian R&B/hip-hop musician, singer-songwriter and record producer. He chose his stage name in tribute to when he was 17 years old, when, along with his friend La Mar Taylor, he dropped out of high school, took his mattress, and ""left one weekend and never came home"". However, his estranged former producer Jeremy Rose claims the name was his idea. The letter E was excluded to avoid trademark problems with the Canadian band The Weekend.

The Weeknd gained widespread critical acclaim for his three mixtapes: House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence, which he later compiled to make a remastered, three-disc album titled Trilogy after signing his record deal with Republic. In 2013, he released Kiss Land, which was considered to be his debut studio album.

In 2014, he dropped “Often,” a remix of Beyonce’s “Drunk In Love,” and “King of the Fall.” The Weeknd released two songs in collaboration with the film Fifty Shades of Grey, with Earned It becoming his solo breakout hit.

His second studio album became highly-anticipated, with riveting singles like  The Hills and Can’t Feel My Face leaving fans hungry for more. Beauty Behind the Madness was released on August 28, 2015.

His third studio album, Starboy, was released on November 25, 2016. The Daft Punk-assisted title track led the project as its first official single, released on Wednesday, September 21, 2016, before becoming his third number one track in the United States, as also his home country, Canada. The effort was a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 albums chart with over 348,000 copies sold in its first week, all eighteen tracks debuting on the Billboard Hot 100, receiving a GRAMMY Award for the Best Urban Contemporary Album, category at the 60th annual ceremony, overall for the second time in his music career and being ranked as the third most popular album of 2017 in the U.S.

Next came the My Dear Melancholy EP, released on March 30, 2018 and revolving around his breakups with Bella Hadid during summer of 2016 and Selena Gomez in October 2017. With the lead single, Call Out My Name, the Canadian singer earned the largest first-day Spotify stream count of any song released in 2018 at that time and his eighth Top 10 entry on Hot 100.

Tesfaye’s fourth studio album (and his first in three years), After Hours was officially released on March 20, 2020, and is named after a 1985 movie directed by his idol, Martin Scorsese. It was primarily supported by November 2019-released singles Heartless and Blinding Lights, with the pair becoming his fourth and fifth #1 singles in the US and the latter his first #1 single in the UK. The title track and In Your Eyes were also released as singles.

Although widely expected to receive multiple nominations for After Hours, Tesfaye failed to receive any nominations for the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021). Tesfaye took to his social media to criticize the Recording Academy, claiming corruption. Speculation arose that the announcement of his then-upcoming Super Bowl performance as well as the discrepancy of being nominated as pop music versus R&B contributed to the snubs. On February 5, 2021 The Highlights was released, as his second greatest hits album. Tesfaye performed at the Super Bowl LV halftime show on February 7, 2021 after announcing he would perform in November 2020. He reportedly spent $7 million on his performance at the show. Despite having a mixed response, the show resulted in a surge in streaming and downloads for Tesfaye's After Hours album as well as for the seven other songs he performed.

His fifth album, Dawn FM was released on January 7, 2022, continuing the writing and production work with Swedish pop svengalis Max Martin and Oscar Holter. The album was preceded by the single Take My Breath in August 2021, with Sacrifice announced as the second single. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.

Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum. His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same, were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late and collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of which earned platinum certification in the U.S. His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records.

Early life
Drake attended both Forest Hill Collegiate Institute (left) and Vaughan Road Academy (right) during high school.
Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practicing Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Drake's mother, Sandra ""Sandi"" Graham (née Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. His parents met after Dennis performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he first interacted with Sandra, who was in attendance. He is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day school, and formally celebrated becoming a Bar Mitzvah in a religious service.

Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Dennis' limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the United States until Drake's early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, however, Dennis would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer. His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song titled ""Drake's Dad"". Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell records, which Drake vehemently denies.

Drake was raised in two Toronto neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end until grade six, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighborhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move, Drake replied, ""[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement; my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.""

He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school. He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighborhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighborhood, Drake described the school as ""not by any means the easiest school to go to."" Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background, and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school. He later graduated in October 2012.

Career - 2001–2005: Degrassi: The Next Generation
At 15, eager to begin as an actor, a high school friend introduced Drake to his father, who was an acting agent. The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks a basketball star who became physically disabled after a classmate shot him. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, ""My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV"". He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, returning for sporadic appearances until his character graduated from school. Overall, Drake appeared in a total of 145 episodes.

2006–2009: Early mixtapes and So Far Gone
Lil Wayne, the founder of Young Money Entertainment, would sign Drake to the label in 2009.
After becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as ""pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it."" The mixtape was released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies. In 2007, he released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single ""Replacement Girl"", featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever-unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with ""Replacement Girl"" being featured on the channel's ""New Joint of the Day"" segment on April 30, 2007. The song also saw Drake sample ""Man of the Year"" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including ""Ransom"", ""Forever"", and a remix to ""Brand New"". Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.

In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles ""Best I Ever Had"" and ""Successful"", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs ""I'm Goin' In"" and ""Fear"". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.

Due to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as ""one of the biggest bidding wars ever"". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album titled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means.

Drake then joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of ""Best I Ever Had"" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He underwent surgery later that year.

2010–2012: Thank Me Later and Take Care
Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.

On March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single ""Over"", which peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, ""Find Your Love"", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[76] The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, ""]Care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image]."" The third single and fourth singles, ""Miss Me"" and ""Fancy"" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.

Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.

It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire on May 8, and he had also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.

Beginning his second effort in fall 2010, Drake announced his intentions to allow for Noah ""40"" Shebib to handle most of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me Later, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and others. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be Take Care. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, ""I didn't get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed many of the songs and sonically I didn't get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round."" Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.

In January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie, to focus on the album. ""Dreams Money Can Buy"" and ""Marvins Room"" were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track listing, while ""Marvins Room"" gained Gold certification by the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio. Drake would soon release the song's music video on June 28.

""Headlines"" was released on August 9, acting as the lead single for Take Care. It was met with positive critical and commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12. It was eventually certified Platinum in both the United States and Canada. The music video for the single was released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game in January 2012. ""Make Me Proud"" was released as the album's second single, on October 16. It was the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number nine the following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88. ""Make Me Proud"" soon became Drake's fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.

Prior to the album's release, Drake had planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne, however, it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne. He had also begun collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled Y.O.L.O., but the duo decided against the project, in favor of increased concern for their respective studio albums.

Take Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. John McDonnell of NME dubbed it ""an affecting masterpiece"" and commended its ""delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive lyrics."" Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal found Drake's ""technical abilities"" to be improved and stated, ""Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up."" Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice called it ""a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West."" Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented the depth of Drake's ""moral psychodramas"" and stated, ""the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying power."" It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial success, eventually being certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the US.

The album's third and fourth singles, ""The Motto"" and Take Care"", were released on November 29, and February 21, 2012 respectively. Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with ""The Motto"" credited for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States. The music video for ""Take Care"" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, ""None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] - make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it."" The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year. The song was also featured on the channel's ""Pop Songs You Must Hear"" list of 2011. ""HYFR"" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified Gold. It would later win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video in 2012, and the channel also ranked him at number two on their ""Hottest MCs in the Game"" list.

In promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip-hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million. He then returned to acting, starring in Ice Age: Continental Drift as Ethan.

2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and commercial mixtapes
During the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer's influence over his next album. Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics prevalent previously.

In January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off of his third album at the conclusion of the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of his third album. The album's second single, ""Hold On, We're Going Home"", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful single off of the album, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song's music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the video. Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing the album's third single, ""Too Much"", alongside featured artist Sampha.

Nothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favorable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in 808s & Heartbreak. The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further promoted by the ""Would You like a Tour?"" throughout late 2013, to early 2014. It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million. Drake then returned to acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night Live, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what ""kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters"". Drake also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city. In late 2014, Drake announced that he had begun recording sessions for his fourth studio album.

In 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the Romeo Santos song Odio. He also appeared on a remix of Tuesday by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard's Rhythmic chart and number twelve on the ""Hot 100"", and released ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"" as a non-album single. The latter went double platinum in the United States.

On February 12, 2015, Drake released If You're Reading This It's Too Late onto iTunes, with no prior announcement. Despite debate on whether it is an album or a mixtape, its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money Records, a scheme that was rumored to allow Drake to leave the label. However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and If You're Reading This It's Too Late sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall. Drake proceeded If You're Reading This It's Too Late with a collaborative mixtape with Future, which was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week.

What a Time to Be Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Drake the first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the same year since 2004. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units. Drake also appeared on the cover of The Fader for their 100th issue.

2016–2017: Views and More Life
Drake announced in January 2016 that his fourth studio album would be launched during the spring, releasing the promotional single ""Summer Sixteen"" later that month. The album was originally titled Views from the six, but would later be shortened to Views. ""Summer Sixteen"" debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip-hop to more tenured artists. This move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as ""goodly brash"" or ""conventionally disrespectful."" It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake popularizing the term ""The Six"" when referencing Toronto. Drake also crashed a Bat Mitzvah in New York City on February 20, performing at the event.

Drake soon released the album's lead singles, ""Pop Style"" and the dancehall-infused ""One Dance"", on April 5. Both debuted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with ""One Dance"" becoming Drake's first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist. The single also became Drake's first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed the album's release date of April 29, and followed it up with various promotional videos. On October 15, ""One Dance"" became Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016.

Views was previewed in London, before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being made available to various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later to release a short film titled Please Forgive Me, starring frequent collaborators, Swedish twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta. As of 2019, Views remains Drake's best-selling album.

Drake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as the show's musical guest. Later, Drake was named as a member of the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury. During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the music video for ""Child's Play"" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics. On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views. At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Drake received the most nominations, with 10, winning the awards for Album of the Year and Best Hip-Hop Video. Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the course of the tour in Europe. Seven additional dates were added a day later due to overwhelming demands.

Soon after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed he would be releasing a project titled More Life in December, however he later pushed the date back to the new year. The project was described as a ""playlist of original music"", rather than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album. He was later revealed to be Spotify's most streamed artist for the second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion streams for all projects on the service, which is more than double the amount of streams he had in 2015. Drake later secured his second and third Grammy Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony. Despite multiple setbacks, Drake announced More Life would be released on March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials released through Instagram. Upon release, More Life received mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200, earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It also set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever streamed album in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music alone. The album also garnered 61.3 million streams on Spotify, dethroning Ed Sheeran's ÷ as the highest opening on the service in a single day. He later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins in a single show. Billboard also reported Drake had been present on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has the most recorded entries by a solo artist.

He then released the single ""Signs"" on June 24, as well as reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset. The singles marked his first releases since More Life, with ""Signs"" was initially released as a collaboration between Drake and French fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the ""Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2018"" fashion show. The event also had a playlist exclusively from OVO Sound, curated by label co-founder Oliver El-Khatib. Drake later hosted the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of Virginia Black. Drake then appeared in The Carter Effect documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince Carter, who was the first superstar player to appear for the Toronto Raptors since the franchise's inception in 1995. The documentary also featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and LeBron James.

2018: Scorpion and return to television
After rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer Pi'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017. Two songs would later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on January 20, 2018, marking Drake's first solo release since More Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring on a remix of the Jay-Z song ""Family Feud"" with Lil Wayne, as the lead single of the latter's Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape. Scary Hours featured the songs ""Diplomatic Immunity"" and ""God's Plan"", which both debuted within the top-ten, with the latter eventually breaking various streaming records as it debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was Drake's second as a solo artist to reach number one.

Drake earned his 70th top 40 hit after featuring on the Migos song ""Walk It Talk It"", which debuted at number eighteen, and peaked at number ten. He later featured on BlocBoy JB's debut single, ""Look Alive"", which was released on February 9, 2018. The song's entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper with the top 10 hits on the Hot 100, with 23. He then featured on a remix to ""Lemon"", a song originally released as collaboration between band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, Drake announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was releasing a single later that night. On April 6, ""Nice for What"" was released, alongside a music video, which featured several female celebrities.

After ""Nice For What"" replaced his own ""God's Plan"" on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace their former number-one debut, Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion, with a planned release date of June 29, 2018. He then released ""I'm Upset"" on May 26, as the album's third single. Scorpion was then released as a double-album, and marked Drake's longest project, with a run-time of just under 90 minutes. The album broke both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it gained 132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming service, respectively. It eventually sold 749,000 album equivalent units in its first week of sales, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.

Shortly thereafter, Drake collaborated with British hip hop promotion Link Up TV on July 7, releasing a freestyle as a part of the promotion's 'Behind Barz' segment, before releasing another freestyle a week later after featuring on Charlie Sloth's long-running Fire in the Booth program on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Drake then earned his sixth number-one hit with ""In My Feelings"" on July 21, which also spawned the viral ""#InMyFeelingsChallenge"" or ""#KiKiChallenge"". The success of ""In My Feelings"" also made Drake the record holder for most number one hits among rappers. Soon after, he released the music video for ""Nonstop"", which was filmed in London during his surprise performance at the Wireless Festival.

He then appeared on the album Astroworld, featuring uncredited vocals for the song ""Sicko Mode"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Drake announced in July 2018 that he planned to ""take 6 months to a year"" to himself in order to produce television and films, including Euphoria. He then began the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour with co-headliners Migos on August 12. This preceded collaboration with Bad Bunny titled ""Mia"", which featured Drake performing in Spanish. He later received the award for Hot Ticket Performer at the 2018 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 16. During a performance in Edmonton on November 7, Drake announced his intention to begin composing his next project in early 2019.

2019–present: Upcoming album
In February 2019, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rap Song, for ""God's Plan"", at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. During his speech, producers abruptly cut to a commercial break, leading viewers to speculate they were censoring his speech during which he criticized The Recording Academy. A legal representative for the Academy then released a statement stating ""a natural pause [led] the producers [to] assume that he was done and cut to commercial,"" and added the organization offered him an opportunity to return to stage, but he declined.

On February 14, Drake re-released his third mixtape, So Far Gone, onto streaming services for the first time to commemorate its 10-year anniversary, and later collaborated with Summer Walker on a remix of Walker's song ""Girls Need Love"", marking his first release of 2019. On April 10, 2019 during a London performance on his Assassination Vacation Tour, the OVO leader told the crowd he was working on his new album before the show. On June 8, Drake appeared on Chris Brown's single ""No Guidance"". On June 15, Drake released two songs, ""Omertà"" and ""Money in the Grave"", on his EP The Best in the World Pack to celebrate the NBA Championship win of the Toronto Raptors. On August 2, he released the compilation album Care Package, consisting of songs released between 2010 and 2016 that were initially unavailable for purchase or commercial streaming; it debuted at number one.

Artistry - influences
Drake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West, Jay Z, and Lil Wayne, while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah, and Usher. Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his ""biggest inspirations"".

Musical style
Drake has credited Kanye West (left) and Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical influences. Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism. His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as ""ting"", ""touching road"", ""talkin' boasy"" and ""gwanin' wassy"". Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip-hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing. He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.

The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional or boastful. However, Drake is often revered for incorporating ""degrading"" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between ""pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata."" Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as ""hyper-reality rap"", which is characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as being distinct from the ""real world.""

Public image
The Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States, with his single, ""The Motto"", which includes, ""You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO."" Drake later popularized the term ""The Six"" in 2015 in relation his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city. Furthermore, the subject matter of his artistry often revolving around relationships, have had widespread impact on social media through photo captions commonly used to reference emotions or personal situations. However, his lyrical contents have had a negative reception from fans and critics deeming him as sensitive; a trait that is understood as being antithetical to hip hop culture. June 10 was declared ""Drake Day"" in Houston, Texas. In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines, in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance. In 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States. He would also donate $200,000 in order to aid relief efforts in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey. In February 2018, following the single ""God's Plan"" debut at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Drake donated $50,000 to a Miami homeless shelter and giving a University of Miami student $50,000 to help with her tuition. Drake then ""kept up the spending spree"" by donating the rest of the song's video budget, $996,631.90, to several charitable causes and regular people across Miami.

The music video for ""Hotline Bling"" went viral, due to Drake's eccentric choices in dancing. The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake's unconventional nature on the song, causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, spawning several parodies. Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exampled by the video for ""Hotline Bling"". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6"" Classic Boots. This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose, in which various items of clothing were produced. Drake had also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the ""Air Jordan OVOs"". Moreover, his style and dress sense have caused GQ magazine to describe him as ""[one of] the most stylish men alive"".

Controversies - legal issues
In 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on ""Marvins Room"". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties. Despite Drake's legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling ""Jimmy Smith Rap"", a 1982 single by jazz musician, Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who stated Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on ""Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2"", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop. Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement. Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics on when collaborating with YG on the song ""Who Do You Love?"". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year. In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.

In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel ""Chubbs"" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also says the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering. The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu, after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference; the judge ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense.

Feuds
Drake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident and released a song criticizing Drake weeks later. Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute.

In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe magazine. Drake would later respond on ""6 God"" and ""6PM in New York"", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment.

Further controversy arose in July 2015, when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during recording sessions for ""RICO"", one of the lead singles off of Mill's second studio album. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller. Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for ""R.I.C.O."". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for ""R.I.C.O."", ""10 Bands"", and ""Know Yourself"". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, titled ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back"", in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with ""Wanna Know"", before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later. Despite subliminal disses from either artist, the feud has not been officially reignited. Drake would further seek to denounce Funkmaster Flex during his Madison Square Garden shows on the Summer Sixteen Tour. Following Meek Mill's sentencing of two to four years for probation violation, Drake stated ""Free Meek Mill"" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on ""Family Feud"". Pusha T would also use the same rationale to criticize Drake on ""Infrared"" in 2018, prompting Drake to respond with the ""Duppy Freestyle"" diss track on May 25. Pusha T would directly respond to the track through ""The Story of Adidon"" on May 29, which presented several claims, including an accusation of Drake fathering a secret child. The pair is considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, with Drake yet to respond to ""The Story of Adidon"".

In 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through ""4PM in Calabasas"", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on ""No Shopping"" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song. However, French Montana claimed that Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake, he has yet to officially respond to Budden. In the same year, Drake mocked Kid Cudi for his mental health, drug use and suicidal urges on ""Two Birds, One Stone"" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter. Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.

In mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator, Kanye West. In an appearance on the talk show The Shop in October, Drake recounted several business meetings with West, who voiced his desire to ""be Quincy Jones"" and work with him, in order to replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson. West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, which was agreed to as Drake ""felt a genuine vibe"" from West, and after West gifted him the beat to ""Lift Yourself"", which inspired Drake to begin writing to the instrumental. West then requested Drake to travel to Wyoming to continue working, and arrived a day after close friend 40. 40 said West was working on an album; contradictory to his previous aim of just wanting to ""give [Drake] beats"". Drake responded by saying West stated he would release in late 2018, and they should continue on. However, upon his arrival in Wyoming, Drake ""[spent] the majority of time working on [West's] music"", only exploring his own after playing the producer the song ""March 14"", which addresses Drake's relationship with his newborn son and co-parent. This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T. West would also release ""Lift Yourself"", and produce ""Infrared""; actions that greatly displeased Drake. This prompted him to denounce West in several songs and live performances. West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018.

Drake has purported to have been in reported feuds with DMX, Kendrick Lamar, Common, The Weeknd, XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez, and Ludacris, although the latter three have been reported to be resolved.

Business ventures - Endorsements
Prior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient. In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger King and Whataburger. Business magazine Forbes commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships ""combined heavily"" for Drake's reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the highest-paid celebrities during that period.

Main article: OVO Sound
During the composition of Nothing Was the Same, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, and business partner, Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the trio to team up to form OVO Sound. The name is an abbreviation derived from the October's Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects. Warner Bros. Records currently distribute the label.

Drake, 40 and PartyNextDoor were the label's inaugural artists. The label houses artists including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, OB O'Brien, Roy Woods, dvsn, Plaza, and Kash Doll, as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Mike Zombie, Nineteen85, and Future the Prince. OVO Sound has released six albums, with two certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Toronto Raptors
On September 30, 2013, at a press conference with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke, Drake was announced as the new ""global ambassador"" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. This would also be the setting where Drake was given The Key to the City. In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities, beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary. He began by hosting an annual ""Drake Night"" segment with the organization, which began in 2013.

Apple Music
Following the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million. This saw all future solo releases by Drake becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers. Drake had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted More Life. Drake's partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform's sharp success, as it attained 10 million subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists, such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services. Through signing with the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before the smartwatch saw public release.

Virginia Black
Two months prior to the release of Views, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based whiskey. This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring's Restaurant in Toronto. The beverage was created and also distributed alongside Proximo Spirits, as well as with Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008. The company described the partnership as ""fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey.""

The product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically. The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music and various tours, such as being part of the ""Virginia Black VIP Lounge"" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016. The company later aired commercials with Dennis Graham, which featured the tagline of ""The Realest Dude Ever"" (in reference toward ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to various European countries in 2017.

Personal life
Drake lives in Hidden Hills, California, since 2012. He also owns a property in Toronto, which was built from the ground-up in 2017, and a Toronto condo adjacent to the CN Tower. He owns a Boeing 767 airplane.

Drake's paternal uncles are bass guitarist Larry Graham and musician Teenie Hodges. Graham achieved both critical and commercial success as a member of the band Sly and the Family Stone, while Hodges featured as the lead guitarist and songwriter for Al Green, and contributed heavily on much of his work in the 1970s, including the hits ""Take Me to the River"", ""Love and Happiness"", and ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"".

Drake is a father to one son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French artist Sophie Brussaux. Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumors after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017; Drake eventually confirmed his fatherhood on the album Scorpion in 2018.

Drake dated singer Rihanna off-and-on from 2009 to 2016. He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums, and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said ""she's a woman I've been in love with since I was 22 years old."" On becoming a single parent, he mused on the talk show The Shop:

As life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don't have the fairy tale, like, 'Oh, Drake started a family with Rihanna and this is like so perfect.' It looks so good on paper. By the way, I wanted that too at one time.

Le rap français, il le découvre au collège, lorsque l’un de ses amis d’enfance lui fait découvrir l’album Ouest Side de Booba.   Puis, le DUC le prend sous son aile et lui propose de signer sur son label 92i ; « Booba m’a fait un honneur. Je n’aurais jamais imaginé ça dans ma vie », confie l’artiste.   Leur alliance est créée et se matérialise très vite avec le titre de SDM feat. BOOBA « La Zone ». 

Les portes du succès sont grandes ouvertes : puissance vocale, froideur « lyricale » et flow chirurgical, SDM offre aussi bien des couplets forts que des refrains entêtants.   Après nous avoir fait danser le « Yakalelo » tout l’été, SDM est désormais sous le feu des projecteurs du rap français : nouveau challenger du game, SDM affirme son ambition haut et fort avec « Titulaires », son banger surpuissant avec Koba LaD. 
La rue, il l’aime et la connaît, son nouveau titre « Prince de la Calle » lui rend hommage.   Sur une mélodie brûlante et entêtante, SDM enchaîne les punchlines et confirme sa puissance.

72,lizzo,1511710,48327017,"Melissa Jefferson (born April 27, 1988 in Detroit, Michigan, U.S.), known professionally as Lizzo, is an American rapper and singer. She is a founding member of indie hip hop groups The Chalice, Grrrl Prty, The Clerb, Ellypseas, and Absynthe. Her debut album, Lizzobangers, was released in 2013. In 2015, she released her sophomore album, Big Grrrl Small World.

Born in Detroit in the late 80’s, Lizzo spent much of her formative years in the church, where she was raised on the gospel sounds of The Winans, The Clark Sisters, and Fred Hammond, along with mainstay secular artists such as Stevie Wonder and Elton John. At the age of 10 her family moved to Houston, TX, and Lizzo was exposed to a wide array of emerging Southern musical styles, from the trademark chopped and screwed rap tracks of the underground, to the progressive and polished R&B sounds of groups like Destiny’s Child that were raising the city’s national profile to new heights. In fact, it was after she stumbled across a Destiny’s Child performance at Wal-Mart that Lizzo—then a 5th grader-- was inspired to start writing music on her own. Over the next decade that decision would take her through the trenches of some of the most varied musical genres: R&B girl groups (I.N.I.T.I.A.L.S., Cornrow Clique), progressive rock bands (Elypseas), solo rap ventures, and electro-pop duos (Lizzo & The Larva Ink).

In 2011 she made the move to Minneapolis with Larva Ink in order to be a part of that city’s blossoming and collaborative musical community. Lizzo & The Larva Ink was well received there, and the group earned a few encouraging nods from the press. Lizzo was soon introduced to Sophia Eris and Claire de Lune, with whom she would form The Chalice, the three-piece all-female rap/R&B group that would elevate Lizzo’s profile and reputation. In 2012 The Chalice released We Are The Chalice, an album that would gain them instant local success amongst fans and critics alike, garnering City Pages’ prestigious Best New Band and Picked To Click accolades in the same year. 

The success brought setbacks, though, and a falling out soon led to the demise of Lizzo & The Larva Ink. Feeling discontent with the loss of one group and the hurried blur of success of another, Lizzo was creatively drained from writing We Are The Chalice in two short months. She found herself in the throes of her first full-blown case of writer’s block. Unable to create music for herself, she began listening to several different local albums in hopes of finding inspiration. It was LAVA BANGERS, a 20-track instrumental mixtape from Doomtree producer and Minneapolis music vet Lazerbeak, that ultimately caught her ear. Beaks’ beats proved the fix for Lizzo’s problem. “I sat at home and listened to LAVA BANGERS, and when “Lift Every Voice” came on, my writer’s block was cured,” says Lizzo. “I think it revived my gospel roots. I wrote pages and pages of songs, and finally reached out to Lazerbeak, not thinking anything would come of it.” 

Her timing could not have been better. Beak, impressed with Lizzo’s output with The Chalice, as well as her guest appearances on several other local releases, was looking for a change of pace from his daily Doomtree production and business responsibilities. He immediately signed on to work on some demos. Beat tapes were exchanged, songs were written, and mutual friend and musical collaborator Ryan Olson (Totally Gross National Product founder, Gayngs/Marijuana Deathsquads mastermind) was brought on board to creatively oversee the project. Olson recorded and edited all 15 tracks in his bedroom studio, bringing in laid back hype-man Cliff Rhymes along the way to add even more layers to Lizzo’s dynamic vocals.

LIZZOBANGERS is the culmination of that four-way collaboration, an album that manages to capture all of the varied musical influences of Lizzo’s upbringing and combine them with the forward-thinking experimental production style of Beak and Olson. The end result is a brave new project that encapsulates the best parts of both the familiar and the future.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lizzo"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

78,cults,2045213,43190062,"The duo of Madeline Follin and Brian Oblivion, Cults' twinkling experimental pop combines gauzy sounds with moods that hit surprisingly hard. On their 2010 breakthrough ""Go Outside,"" dream pop haze and '60s girl group harmonies provided the perfect backdrop for Follin's sweetly empathetic vocals, creating the template for Cults' sound. On the albums that followed, the duo gave different nuances to this style. They added Technicolor vibrancy to 2011's Cults; darkness that echoed the end of their romantic relationship on 2013's Static; and a streamlined approach that reflected the electro-pop purveyors that sprang up in their wake on 2017's Offering. On this album and 2020's Host, Follin's growing creative input reinforced the delicate yet enduring appeal of Cults' music.

Cults formed in 2010, when native San Franciscans Follin and Oblivion were attending school in New York City (Oblivion was a documentary film student at NYU; Follin was studying at the New School). A couple at the time, they wrote and recorded songs in Oblivion's apartment using a computer and a cheap midi keyboard, and before the year was over, they released their self-titled debut EP on Forest Family Records. One of the EP's songs, ""Go Outside,"" which Cults recorded with Paul Kostabi at Thunderdome Studios, became a viral hit, earning acclaim from publications including Pitchfork and NME.

Cults built on the success of ""Go Outside"" by touring with Richie Follin's Band (the project of Madeline's older brother) for six months. They then signed to In the Name Of, an imprint of Columbia Records founded by Lily Allen. Produced by Shane Stoneback, Cults' June 2011 self-titled album delivered more of their atmospheric, retro-futuristic indie pop and charted in the U.K., Canada, and the U.S., reaching number 52 on Billboard's Top 200 Albums Chart. That year, the duo also appeared on the AIDS/HIV research benefit album Red Hot+Rio 2, collaborating with Superhuman Happiness on a cover of ""Um Canto de Afoxé para o Bloco Do Ilê."" Along with touring in support of the album, Cults also appeared at the Portishead-curated ATP I'll Be Your Mirror festival that September and at ATP's Nightmare Before Christmas festival, which was curated by Battles, that December.

In October 2013, Cults returned with their second album, Static. Recorded with Stoneback in the wake of Follin and Oblivion's breakup, it won strong reviews for its emotive songwriting and peaked at number 114 on the Billboard Top 200. That month, the duo also appeared with Amber Coffman on J. Cole's ""She Knows"" from his album Born Sinner; the song hit number 90 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart. Following the 2014 single ""Being It,"" Cults took some time off. In 2016, Follin formed the group Follin with her brother Richie, and released the single ""Roxy"" that February.

For their next album, Cults took a more collaborative approach, with Follin playing drums and keyboards as well as singing. After working with Stoneback in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco studios, Cults emerged in October 2017 with Offering, which borrowed from influences as wide-ranging as Pink Floyd, Gary Numan, and the Motels, whose music they'd fallen in love with while touring with Total Control in Australia. They explored their passion for the Motels further in 2018 with a track-by-track cover of the band's 1979 self-titled debut that was part of Turntable Kitchen's Sounds Delicious series. The following year saw the release of Offering B Sides & Remixes, which featured reworkings of the album's tracks by Mike Simonetti, Etienne de Crecy, and John Fryer.

Cults began work on their next album in early 2019, teaming with Stoneback on songs that, for the first time, featured live instrumentation and included lyrics by Follin.

79,bts,1890587,2231387939,"BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band formed in Seoul in 2013. The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several world tours.

The group initially formed as teenagers under Big Hit Entertainment and released their debut single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. Billboard 200 entries The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 (2015), The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016), and Wings (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. Wings became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) with their single ""Mic Drop"". The band is the first Korean act to top the U.S. Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums Love Yourself: Answer (2018) and Map of the Soul: Persona (2019), making BTS the first group since The Beatles to earn three number one albums in less than a year, and the fastest to earn three number one albums since The Monkees in 1967. Love Yourself: Answer also broke South Korea's Gaon Album Chart's all-time monthly record previously set by Love Yourself: Tear and became the first Korean album certified Gold in the United States.

According to Gaon Music Chart, BTS has sold fifteen million albums domestically and is the best-selling artist to debut in the 2010s. They hold the best-selling album in Korean history with Map of the Soul: Persona. BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the IFPI's Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. The group has won Top Social Artist three years in a row and Top Duo/Group at the 26th Billboard Music Awards. Featured on Time's international cover as ""Next Generation Leaders"", BTS has appeared in the magazine's 25 most influential people on the internet (2017–2019) and Time's 100 most influential people in the world (2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname 'Princes of Pop'. Forbes Korea named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018, and BTS ranked 43rd in the Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities. During their 2019 Love Yourself World Tour, BTS became the first Asian artist ever to headline and sell out Wembley Stadium and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in Rose Bowl Stadium history. BTS are worth more than $4.65 billion to South Korea's economy each year, attracting one in every 13 foreign tourists that visit the country, and are cited as one of the key acts boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018, a figure not seen since 2006 after digital purchases gained momentum.

Following the establishment of their Love Myself anti-violence campaign in partnership with UNICEF, BTS addressed the United Nations 73rd General Assembly and became the youngest ever recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit from the President of South Korea due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/BTS"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

91,jid,1125894,74551018,"Destin Route (b. October 31, 1990), better known by the stage name JID, is an American rapper from Zone 6, Atlanta, Georgia. He describes himself as “a soft-spoken but intricate lyricist with a cocky side.” His stage name originates from “jittery,” his grandmother’s nickname for him due to his sporadic behavior as a child.

He first appeared on the Atlanta hip-hop scene with his debut EP, DiCaprio, in 2015. Growing up, JID's first connection with music was through his parents' collection of classic funk and soul LPs. After a stint at Hampton University playing football, JID also hooked up with fellow MCs as part of the Spillage Village collective. By 2012, he had dropped out of college to focus on music, and in 2014 he headed out on what would be a productive tour with EarthGang, Bas, and Ab-Soul. Touring allowed JID to craft his skills, and a year later he recorded and dropped the DiCaprio EP, which saw him team up with a host of producers, as well as EarthGang. While keen to distance himself from the generic abrasive trap sound that had dominated the Atlanta scene, JID wanted to deliver something that was more than just about a beat, and instead focused his time and effort on lyrics as well. In 2016, JID, alongside the rest of the Spillage Village crew, released the album Bears Like This Too Much, which saw the rapper honing his unique delivery and inspired lyrics. In 2017, he announced that he had signed to J. Cole's Dreamville label (a connection made with the rapper via JID's part in the 2014 tour with Bas and Cole's friend and producer Cedric Brown), which released the single Never and full-length The Never Story at the beginning of the year. In September of 2018, he issued the single ""151 Rum,"" the first offering from DiCaprio 2, his sophomore full-length and sequel to his 2015 EP. Later that year he released the album ""Dicaprio 2"". JID released his most recent album, ""The Forever Story"" on August 26th, 2022, the two singles on the album, ""Surround Sound (feat. 21 Savage & Baby Tate)"" and ""Dance Now"" were released on January 14th 2022, and August 9th 2022 respectively. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Jid"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Austin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York. He was raised by his father, Richard Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip-hop, country, and rock. When Malone was nine years old, he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys. Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition.

Malone has always had a love for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event. According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band. He says soon afterward he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip-hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.

According to Malone, he chose ""Post Malone"" as his stage name when he was 14 or 15.

98,topic,476517,5352594,"There are several artists with the name Topic.

1. Tobias Topic (born March 23, 1992) is a Croatian-German DJ, producer and musician. In 2008, he started using Logic Studio, a digital audio workstation, to produce music with the guidance of a teacher. He started his musical career on social media with the assistance of YouTube musicians who contacted him.

Topic's first release, a house song called ""Light It Up"", was released at the end of 2014 and reached more than one million views on his YouTube channel. In summer 2015, he released his debut album Miles. In 2019, he released his single ""Breaking Me"", featuring Swedish singer A7S. The single reached the top 10 positions in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, and Ireland. With ""Breaking Me"", Topic also reached the British single charts for the first time and got his first number one in Portugal. In the US, he dominated the Dance chart for three weeks. In October 2020, the single reached 500 million streams on Spotify and over one billion streams overall.



2. Life for ‘Topic’ began in West LA and evolved in West Covina throughout his adolescent years. The Yin and Yang lifestyle of religious based principles instilled by his mother and hard knock life experiences learned from his father laid the foundation on which this universal rap artist was formed.

Extremely confident in his ability to write or rap about anything, hence the evolution of the epithet “Topic’. No literary form of expression can exist without a ‘Topic’. Having a true love for music since the early days of his youth, Topic began singing and writing his own lyrics in grade school. By the summer of 8th grade writing his first rhyme created a natural euphoria for the lyricist, and an addiction for which there is no cure, only temporary relief. In 1993, Topic had his first experience in a professional recording studio. He took advantage of the opportunity and learned all he could about the mechanics behind the development of a song.

An innate passion for writing combined with being outspoken and a natural leader, this lyricist is certain to accomplish what he wants. What he wants is to share his truth on different points of discussion by expressing them in his lyrics. There is truly no fear emanating from this man when a pen is in hand. In love with the lyrics that flow from his soul he stirs up the game on a mental level while stimulating your desire to move to the beat.

Along with staying modest, balancing confidence with humility and driven by a passion to spit the truth, Topic began performing in local clubs, competitions and underground spots throughout LA, the Inland Empire, and West Covina. The development of his own company BOSS (Business Over Stupid Shit) Life World Inc. is a testament to the prodigious potential the artist possesses.

Topic has endured a series of tribulations synonymous with the testing of Job. His lyrical schemes reflect the influence of his life experiences as well as those around him. Marrying his strengths, insecurities and weaknesses with the melodic element of hip-hop, it is ingenious the way he brings the truth so uninhibited it exposes the very soul of the man.

The Boss of it all with a canvas of soul felt, epic beats of street life and hard-core hustle make it difficult for you to ignore the formidable hip-hop rap artist. Possessing all attributes of a West Coast gangster but the demeanor of a true businessman, this prolific rapper honed his skills and landed a record deal with SRC Universal through the independent label Drama Family.

Previously working with “WC” of Westside Connection, Knocturnal, and Shanta formerly of Aftermath, also alongside producers such as; Johnathan “JR” Rotem, Cool and Dre, Jelly Roll, and Neff-u who has production credits for almost every music genre, and artist from Dr. Dre to U2. Now label mates with such artists as the world renowned multi-platinum selling Akon and David Banner, Topic will soon accomplish his mission to make a predominant impact in the Industry.

‘Topic’ can be defined as complex but not complicated, simplistic but by no means simple. Ardently motivated by success and God’s timing the intimate, hard-hitting songs written by this artist are sure to induce an encore. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Topic"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

99,yuridia,173979,2815799,"Yuridia Francisca Gaxiola Flores (born October 4, 1986, in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico) was one of the 5 finalists of the 4th emission of the popular Mexican reality singing show ""La Academia"". Although she was the first runner up, she has clearly been the most successful singer from those who participated in the 4th emission, which is thought by many to be comparable to Clay Aiken's accomplishment in the second season of American Idol.

Only 20, Yuridia has become one of the highest selling artists in Mexico. Her debut album (consisting of songs that she interpreted during the contest) has reached the diamond selling category (for over 700,000 copies sold), a feat only achieved in the last 10 years by solo artist Luis Miguel, as well as the music group RBD. Not only has she become the highest selling artist to come out of the reality-tv talent show, but her powerful strong chest and head voice, along with her wide mezzosoprano vocal range, have earned her the nickname Voz de un Angel (Voice of an Angel). She is considered to be among the best female voices in Mexico since the 80s (when brilliant artists such as Lupita D'alessio, Dulce and Yuri were top stars in the Mexican scene).

In late September of 2006, her record company, Sony BMG, announced the release of Yuridia's new Album, titled Habla El Corazon, which will feature English covers of well-known artists such as Bonnie Tyler and the The Police. ""Como yo"", and ""Habla el corazón"" (covers from Bon Jovi and Roxette) were among the singles released from the CD. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Yuridia"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

103,mau y ricky,164789,2213714,"For the past few years, Mauricio and Ricky Montaner had been busy writing songs for other artists like Thalía, Miguel Bosé, Diego Boneta, Yuridia, Leslie Grace, to name a few, until recently when they decided the songs they were composing would be for their EP titled Arte under the label of Sony Music.

The young duo, Mau y Ricky, sons of music icon Ricardo Montaner, have released the album's first single, ""Voy Que Quemo,"" a song they decided best represents the music that is coming out in the LP, expected to release in July. ""After writing so many songs, it just seemed natural to start recording an album,"" Ricky, 25, tells Billboard, speaking on behalf of the duo since Mau was on vocal rest. ""We have 10 songs and an 11th that is an instrumental track. 'Voy Que Quemo' seemed like the best song to release first, and we're feeling super excited and nervous.""

Mau y Ricky partnered with Latin Grammy winner Julio Reyes Copello to produce their album and credit him for allowing them to grow artistically and teach them about following their intuition. ""We've grown as producers and songwriters, thanks to him. We also learned that the intuition of an artist is so important and it's something that needs to be respected because your intuition will differentiate you from others. We learned to write for ourselves and put out songs that will represent who we are.""

And that's exactly what Mau y Ricky did. They followed their intuition after listening to their song ""Arte"" which was almost going to be pitched to Wisin, but Ricky says, ""It didn't feel right for another artist to sing this song."" Another man they have to thank for guiding them since they started composing at a very young age is their father, who has written hit singles like ""La Cima del Cielo,"" ""Déjame Llorar"" and ""Me Va a Extrañar.""

""We've written songs together, so working with him helps you grow a lot because he's a very hard critic. Every song I've written since I was 8 years old, I'd run it by him and he'd give me feedback. He actually just heard the final product of our album and he loved it, thank God. But the best thing is that he's a fan of ours and we're huge fans of him. Yeah, he's my dad, but I'm a huge Ricardo Montaner fan.""

Besides a new album, Mau y Ricky fans can expect to see them onstage soon as they go out on tour. ""We haven't toured in such a long time because we were busy writing for others then started working on this album, but the stage is our natural habitat and where we feel most comfortable."" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mau+y+Ricky"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

""I talk about a lot of things my generation is struggling with on this album.""

Punctuated by her grit-glam marvel, Barrett's music has intrinsically always been about empowering people who feel isolated. ""Growing up, I was very ashamed of my struggles, so the second I got a platform, I knew what I had to do with it because I didn't want anyone to feel the way I felt - alone.""

Since the age of 10, she's been writing her own music, slowly developing all the time to become the artist she is today. Along the way, RAYE has become confidently adept at various different instruments including the cello, flute, and piano, alongside honing her production skills (and learning  to play the guitar). Music has always been a huge part of RAYE’s life. Brought up on the classic soul/jazz maestros of the 40's and 50's like Nina Simone, Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole etc - this is where her love for songwriting and melody began. Since then her influences, have aligned with the times, citing Drake, and her all time hero Lauryn Hill as huge sources of inspiration. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Raye"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

112,damas gratis,71356,1112662,"Damas Gratis es un grupo musical de cumbia villera. Desde su salida, obtienen un éxito con su primer CD, al que titularon ""Para los pibes"", llevándolos a los mejores rankins de la cumbia en Argentina, Paraguay y Chile y popularizando el estilo de ""cumbia villera"" con el tema ""Se te ve la tanga"". Recientemente ya llegaron a presentarse en Mexico especialmente en Monterrey donde realizaron bailes masivos logrando en el auditorio coca cola un lleno impresionante de alrrededor de 20,000 personas y en el lugar de origen de la cumbia, Colombia, siendo el primer grupo argentino del genero de cumbia villera en trascender tanto internacionalmente.

La banda fue creada por Pablo Lescano. Anteriormente Pablo había integrado la prestigiosa banda Amar Azul en calidad de teclista. También fue el creador, el compositor y el alma del primer grupo de ""cumbia villera"" de Argentina Flor de Piedra, aunque no participó como músico en ella. Quién si lo hizo fue Romina Lescano, su hermana, que luego lo acompañó en Damas Gratis.

El estilo que empezó a asomar con Flor de Piedra alcanzó el máximo de profesionalismo con Damas Gratis. Hizo explosión y se consolidó en un indiscutible éxito relegando decenas de imitaciones a rol secundario.

Damas Gratis, sin letras románticas, melodías melosas ni carilindos colocó nuevamente a nuestra música tropical en los más variados sectores sociales, logro alcanzado por muy pocos grupos en la historia de la movida tropical.

La música y el ritmo de Damas Gratis continuó avanzando hasta trascender los límites de la música tropical, así lo reflejan diversos artículos publicados en diarios líderes en sus respectivos países como ser: Clarín, La Nación, El País, Buenos Aires Herald y revistas como Noticias o Rolling Stone, que también se ocuparon de este fenómeno que revolucionó la movida tropical y a la vez ubicó en los canales de televisión un rico debate alrededor de la cultura de las villas.


 Música de películas  [editar]Las melodías de Pablo Lescano siguen rompiendo fronteras culturales, ya que el filme del argentino Pablo Trapero ""El Bonaerense"", llegó a Francia al ""Festival de Cine de Cannes"" y su banda de sonido es de Pablo Lescano con ""Damas Gratis"". Este material es un símbolo además de la integración: una rareza para el “culto” como para el cumbiambero (banda de sonido ""El Bonaerense"").

113,ado,454915,39849142,"There are several artists with this name:

1) Ado (born October 24, 2002 in Tokyo, Japan) is a Japanese singer and Utaite and is often considered to be one of the most promising and popular young singers in Japan. 

In 2014, Ado took an interest in music after the video-sharing website Niconico was released on the Nintendo 3DS. She began watching videos on the small screen of said handheld game console, and was impressed by the cover singers on Niconico who sang without showing their faces. In 2017, she began singing as an utaite on Niconico after uploading a video of herself singing a cover of ""Kimi no taion"" (Your Heat) on January 10, 2017.

In 2020, at the age of 17, she made her debut with the digital single titled Usseewa. The song peaked at number 1 on Billboard Japan Hot 100, Oricon Digital Singles Chart, Oricon Streaming Chart, and Spotify Viral 50 Japan. The music video of the song on her YouTube channel reached 100 million views in 148 days after its release. Reaching 100 million plays on Billboard Japan after 17 weeks from charting-in was the sixth fastest in history and the youngest for a solo singer.

Despite the popularity of her debut song and singles shortly after it, she has always remained anonymous in public and still to this day, her face is still mostly unknown. She has been an Utaite (mostly anonymous cover artists) and a fan of Hatsune Miku and other Vocaloids throughout her life which could be assumed to be a reason why alongside simple privacy reasons. 

2022 is regarded as a very significant year in her career. She released her first two Albums: Kyougen (January 2022) and the album dedicated to One Piece: Film Red (August 2022 / More info down below), getting to create two theme songs for the Live Action Movie, ""Karada Sagashi"" as well as having live performances and other collaborations and events throughout the year. 

In the Summer of 2022, She played a major role in the movie One Piece: Film Red for the very popular anime series One Piece as she released an album dedicated to the movie. The album was a big success and appeared everywhere on domestic musical charts and broke numerous records throughout the process. Notably, every song in the album all individually placed very highly on every Japanese musical chart including Spotify, Billboard and Apple Music. the very latter of which saw her have seven songs take up the top seven spots on August 14th. Impressively, she is the only Japanese Artist in history to occupy all the top 5 spots on a musical chart with songs from the same album. 

In 2023, Ado continued releasing singles, released her third album as well as  the announcement of her first world tour. Notable singles this year include ""Show"" and ""Kura Kura"". The former quickly solidifying itself as one of her most popular songs with the latter being used as the opening song for the anime ""Spy x Family"", becoming her first TV anime opening. 

Her third album, ""Ado's Utattemita Album"" was released in December of 2023 which is a cover album featuring various Vocaloid and J-pop songs, which fans voted on for her to cover.

On April 20, 2024, Ado announced her second studio album, ""Zanmu"". The album released on July 10, 2024, alongside a live CD from her first world tour ""Wish"" recorded at Peacock Theater, California.

2) Adolfo Makuntima Makwiza (aka Ado and  Ado Makuntima) contributed to the African music scene in Toronto for over ten years. In fact, he was the first African-Canadian to found an African musical group there. Although he admitted that it's challenging to live as an artist in Canada, he had won support across the country, mostly from African music lovers seeking another opportunity to put on their dancing shoes.

Despite social, political and economic difficulties in the Democratic Republic of Congo, dance and celebration are central to emotional expression. Thus, it comes as no surprise that Ado knew how to enjoy life and that his music is a reflection of it. The hip-swinging rhythms and electrifying guitar of African rumba and Soukous define his classic Congolese style.

He died on Dec 29th, 2017 of a heart attack.

After his judges’ houses performance of «I Can’t Make You Love Me», he was picked by his mentor Nicole Scherzinger as one of the 12 contestants for the live shows, and one of just three in the «Boys» category. After the second live show, Arthur suffered from an anxiety attack backstage. Whilst being treated at the studio, paramedics determined he did not need to go to hospital, and he was ordered back to his hotel to rest. He later returned for the results show the following. Arthur was in the bottom two in week 7 after performing «Can’t Take My Eyes Off You». He sang «Fallin’» for survival against Ella Henderson, with the judges going to deadlock after their vote was evenly split 2-2 (mentor Scherzinger and Gary Barlow voting to keep him, while Contostavlos and Louis Walsh voted in favour of Henderson). Arthur was then saved by the public vote. On 8 December, he made it through to the second night of the live finals.
Arthur won The X Factor on 9 December 2012, with 53.7% of the vote, against Jahméne Douglas who received 38.9% of the vote. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/James+Arthur"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

124,omar apollo,1220973,52014433,"Omar Apolonio Velasco (born May 20, 1997), known professionally as Omar Apollo, is a Mexican-American singer-songwriter from Hobart, Indiana. Apollo sings in both English and Spanish.

He started his career by creating and uploading his songs to the DIY streaming platform SoundCloud. During this time, he worked at Jimmy John's and Guitar Center and lived in an attic. In 2017, using $30 borrowed from a friend, he uploaded his song ""Ugotme"" to Spotify, where it was soon playlisted on the platform's Fresh Finds and racked up 20,000 streams in a day. A year later, the song would cross more than 15 million streams. He released his first EP, Stereo in 2018, which was similarly well received. 

In 2018 and 2019 he went on two tours, the ""Want Tour"" and the ""Voyager Tour"". During the 32-date ""Voyager Tour"" he released his second EP, Friends, in April 2019. He went on his first European tour in 2019 as well, and played at Lollapalooza in August.
 In late 2019, Apollo released the singles ""Frío"" and ""Hit Me Up"", both collaborations with producer Kenny Beats. In April 2020, Apollo released the single ""Imagine U"", another collaboration with Kenny Beats, and on August 7, he released ""Stayback"", the lead single from what would come to be his first mixtape, Apolonio,. On September 10, he released the second single ""Kamikaze"". 
On September 25, Apollo appeared on alternative R&B Japanese-Australian singer Joji’s second album Nectar on the track ""High Hopes"". 
Apollo released ""Dos Uno Nueve (219)"" and ""Want U Around"" (with the last one featuring Ruel) before releasing Apolonio on October 16. 

In 2021, Omar released ""Go Away"" and ""Bad Life"", the first two singles from his debut studio album, Ivory. ""Bad Life"", which features Kali Uchis, marked the second time the singers collaborated together, with the first being ""Hey Boy"", from Apollo's first mixtape, Apolonio.
In February 2022, Apollo released Invincible, the third single from Ivory, featuring Daniel Caesar, and announced the release date for his album. On the following months, he'd go to release ""Killing Me"" and ""Tamagotchi"", with the latter one being co-written and produced by The Neptunes.

Ivory received mostly positive reviews with praises going towards Apollo's musical growth and vocal performance. The album entered the Billboard 200 chart, marking his first-ever entry on the chart.
In September 2022, the track ""Evergreen"" went viral on TikTok which helped boost the song to enter the Spotify and Apple Music charts and eventually debut on Billboard Hot 100 at number 62 for the week ending of October 1, 2022, earning Apollo his first-ever entry on the chart. In response to the rising success, the song was chosen as the album's next single and was later sent to contemporary hit radios on October 4, 2022, making it his first-ever radio single.

In 2022, Apollo also performed at Coachella and in early 2023, opened for SZA on her SOS Tour.
In September 2023, Omar was honored with the Inspira Award at the 2023 Hispanic Heritage Awards.

In October 6th, 2023, Omar released his third EP, Live For Me, which contains the single ""Ice Slippin"".

Apollo is openly gay and has denied queerbaiting allegations, stating, 'It's not a choice, it's just what I am. (...) I'm totally aware of the privilege we have now to be ourselves and still have a career (...) people thought I was queerbaiting before. I wasn't super open about my sexuality, but people were hearing things. (...) It had a lot to do with me growing up in Indiana which is very conservative. I stopped putting pronouns in my music for a couple of years then I just realized, I can't let other people's opinions influence and dictate my life"".
In an interview in 2022, Apollo discussed the labeling of his sexuality, saying ""I feel like in the beginning, (...) I was trying to keep the mystique. But I don't even care anymore (...) now I'm just like, I'm very gay"".

Growing up, he listened to his parents' favorite musicians such as Pedro Infante, Los Panchos and The Beatles. His own influences include diverse musicians such as Neil Young, John Mayer, Prince, Bootsy Collins, and The Internet. 
His parents gifted him a guitar when he was 12, but, unfortunately, it was an eletric guitar without an amp. He traded it for an acoustic guitar at a pawn shop and eventually learned how to play it by watching and mimicking YouTube cover videos. A newer guitar he’d bought later on got stolen when he was 15 and it took him a couple years to get a new one and get back into playing. He then also learned how to sing on YouTube, after receiving criticism on his voice from his dad and friends.
Omar attended Indiana University Northwest, but dropped out two weeks in because he felt like he was supposed to be doing something else and wanted to focus on music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/omar+apollo"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

125,radwimps,543308,29955588,"Radwimps is a Japanese rock band that formed in their first year of highschool in 2001 in Kanagawa, Japan. They play an eccentric mix of rock, punk, funk and jazz. The band achieved great commercial success in 2006 with their album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, and are best known for their later singles ""Order Made"" (2008) and ""Dada"" (2011), both of which hit number one on Oricon's single charts.

The five original members had been friends since middle school. Vocalist Yojiro Noda first became interested in music after hearing Oasis in middle school, when he would try to remember the guitar chords and sing to Oasis songs. He was asked to become the vocalist by a friend, and originally band activities were balanced with basketball. The band's name was formed from two English language slang terms, rad and wimp. According to the band, the coined word had several meanings, including ""excellent weakling"" and ""superlative coward.""

The band's activities began centred around Yokohama, with the band performing their first live at live house BB Street in Yokohama's Kannai district on February 5, 2002. At this point, guitarist Akira Kuwahara dropped out of high school in order to focus on the band. In September and August 2002, the band partook in the Yokohama High School Music Festival, and eventually won the grand prize for the competition with the song ""Moshi mo."" ""Moshi mo"" was released as the band's debut single in May 2003, with 10,000 copies pressed and sold for 100 yen each. Following this single, the band toured the Yokohama area, including a performance as the sole act at Yokohama's Club 24West. The band released their debut album Radwimps in July through independent label Newtraxx, featuring songs written by the band in middle school. The following August, after a guest appearance at the Yokohama High School Music Festival, the band went on hiatus for Noda and other members to focus on their school exams.

Radwimps returned from hiatus in March 2004, however members Kei Asō, Yūsuke Saiki and Akio Shibafumi did not decide to resume band activities. An audition was not held for new members, instead, acquaintances to the band members, drummer Satoshi Yamaguchi and bassist Yusuke Takeda, were added to the group without the members even having their skills trialled. Takeda met the band members in August 2003 as a member of a different band performing in the Yokohama High School Music Festival. The band immediately began recording songs, and by July released a second single, ""Kiseki,"" and performed a three month Japan-wide tour. Immediately after the end of the tour, the band started work on their second album, Radwimps 2: Hatten Tojō, which was finalized by the end of the year and released in March.

Directly after the release, the band departed on a five month tour, Radwimps Haruna Tour (はるなっTOUR?), and also performed at high profile summer music festivals, such as Setstock, Rock in Japan and Summer Sonic. During this time, the band released a third single, ""Hexun / Kanashi,"" which was the band's first charting release.

In November, the band made their major debut single under Toshiba EMI with the single ""Nijūgoko-me no Senshokutai,"" followed by ""EDP (Tonde Hi ni Iru Natsu no Kimi)"" in January, both top 50 singles. In shifting to a major label, Noda explained that the band took the same stance as they had as an independent band, and that ""If we thought we were bigger on a major label, that would have been a big mistake."" The band's third and first major label album, Radwimps 3: Mujintō ni Motte Ikiwasureta Ichimai in March 2006, was a landmark in establishing their popularity, debuting at number 13 on Oricon's album charts. Radwimps 3 saw a change in the band's musical style, allowing the band to be more experimental in their sound.

By the end of 2006 the band's popularity had exponentially grown: the band's album Radwimps 4: Okazu no Gohan, lead with the top 20 singles ""Futarigoto"" and ""Yūshinron"" and top five ""Setsuna Rensa,"" debuted at number five and had an initial shipment of more than 100,000 copies. In this time, the band's older releases, such as Radwimps, Radwimps 2 and ""Kiseki"" began charting for the first time and continued to for extended periods, Radwimps even eventually being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. In the next three years, both Radwimps and Radwimps 2 charted for approximately 100 weeks, and as of early 2011, Radwimps 3 and Radwimps 4 still continue to chart.

In 2008, the band received their first number one single, with ""Order Made"", on the Oricon charts. Their 2009 album Altocolony no Teiri sold around 213,000 copies in its first week, debuting at number 2 on the Oricon charts. The band received their second Oricon number one single ""Dada"" in 2011.

The band gained renewed notoriety in 2016 when they provided the soundtrack for the Makoto Shinkai film ""Kimi no Na wa. (Your Name.)"", which went on to become the highest-grossing anime film in history. One of the four vocal tracks, ""Zenzenzense"", was a #1 hit in Japan. The partnership continued when Radwimps provided the soundtrack for Shinkai's 2019 film ""Weathering With You"".

129,doja cat,2914613,344947758,"Doja Cat rose from viral novelty track buzz to mainstream superstar with her smooth, hypnotic, R&B-flecked pop songs of sexuality, friendship, and personal power. She gained some significant attention with her early releases, but it was her 2019 sophomore effort, Hot Pink, that took her to the top of the Hot 100. Subsequent charting singles and collaborations with SZA and Saweetie further solidified her star power, and made the arrival of her 2021 album Planet Her all the more hotly anticipated. A number two Billboard 200 hit, Planet Her also earned several Grammy nominations. Singles followed, including her savvy 2022 cover of Hole's ""Celebrity Skin"" 2022's ""Vegas"" off the Elvis soundtrack, and 2023's trip-hop-inflected ""Attention"" all of which spotlighted Doja's adventurous, genre-crossing sensibilities. The latter track and ""Paint the Town Red"" appeared on her fourth album, 2023's Scarlet, which found her digging deep into her rap and hip-hop roots and became her third consecutive album to hit the Top Ten of the Billboard 200. Doja Cat was born Amala Zandile Dlamini in 1995 in Tarzana, California, the daughter of South African actor Dumisani Dlamini and painter Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer. After moving to New York for a few years, she returned to California with her mother. As a child, she studied piano and took tap, ballet, and jazz dance lessons. She also discovered surfing and breakdancing. By her teens, she was teaching herself to sing and listening to an eclectic mix of hip-hop, indie rock, R&B, and electronic music. Doja also began recording songs on her computer and in 2014 released her debut EP, Purrr! She quickly found herself with a viral hit with the track ""So High"" More singles followed, including the languid ""Nunchucks"" and ""No Police"" each one grabbing attention online. Another single, ""Mooo!"" arrived in 2018 and quickly went viral. On the heels of that success, Doja Cat issued her full-length debut album, Amala, which found her expanding upon her dreamy, meme-friendly sound with more hip-hop-, pop-, and R&B-infused tracks, including ""Candy"" and ""Roll with Us"" In 2019, she issued an expanded version of Amala that added the singles ""Juicy"" and ""Tia Tamera"" featuring Rico Nasty. Her sophomore album, Hot Pink, was quick to follow; with features from Smino, Gucci Mane, and Tyga, the 2019 LP leaned more into the sexually wry aspects of her ever-shifting persona. A Top Ten hit on the Billboard 200, the album's fifth single, ""Say So"" pushed her even further up the charts. After making a steady rise in the Hot 100 at the start of 2020, the multi-platinum track finally hit number one in May, boosted by a Nicki Minaj remix. After picking up a couple of American Music Awards, Doja carried the momentum from her breakout year into 2021. She began appearing alongside established celebrities more frequently, adding a guest feature to Saweetie's single ""Best Friend"" contributing to an Ariana Grande remix with Megan Thee Stallion, and releasing the SZA-assisted single ""Kiss Me More"" All of this led up to the June 2021 release of her third full-length studio album, Planet Her. It featured guest spots from Young Thug, The Weeknd, JID, and others, and its cover art was shot by photographer David LaChapelle. The album, which reached number two on the Billboard 200 and topped the R&B albums chart, also garnered Grammy nominations for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album. In February 2022, Doja hit number 18 on the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart with a cover of Hole's ""Celebrity Skin"" which featured lyrics reworked by her and Courtney Love. That same year, she reached the Top Ten of the Hot 100 with ""Vegas"" her contribution to the soundtrack to director Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic. In June 2023, she debuted the '90s trip-hop-inspired ""Attention"" as the first track released off her fourth studio album, Scarlet. Another song, ""Paint the Town Red"" followed that August as the official first single. Arriving that September, the album found Doja balancing her pop-R&B style with tracks that embraced her rap and hip-hop roots. It featured production by a handful of artists, including Earl on the Beat, D.A. Got That Dope, and Y2K, among others. A Top Five album on both the Billboard 200 and Rap Albums charts, Scarlet also earned several Grammy nominations, including Best Pop Solo Performance for ""Paint the Town Red"" and Best Rap Song for ""Attention"" <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Doja+Cat"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

143,ellie goulding,3346543,125561969,"Ellie Goulding (born Elena Jane Goulding, 30 December 1986 in Hereford, England) is an English singer-songwriter. Having caught the public's attention in 2010 with her singles ""Starry Eyed"" and ""Guns and Horses,"" British vocalist Ellie Goulding quickly rose to the top of the charts with her infectious electronic pop sound. Although she started out writing songs in a folk-inflected style, she eventually grew into a more electronic-influenced artist, touching upon dance music and ambient synth pop. With her unique soprano warble and knack for writing catchy yet emotionally earnest songs, Goulding, much like her predecessors Kate Bush and Imogen Heap, stands at the forefront of contemporary mainstream music and arty, independent-minded pop.

Born in Hereford, England, she later moved to the country's east coast to study drama at the University of Kent. Goulding had developed a love for folk music as a teenager, and her time at university also exposed her to electronica. After two years, she took a break from her studies and moved to West London, where she pursued a career as an alternative singer/songwriter and befriended producers like Starsmith and Frankmusik, who gave her songs an electro-pop twist. In 2009, Goulding began building an audience via the Internet, where early tracks like ""Starry Eyed"" and a cover of Sam Sparro's ""Black & Gold"" were posted on tastemaking MP3 blogs such as Discodust. Goulding soon graduated from the blogosphere to print media, gaining praise from mainstream publications like The Guardian and fielding offers from record labels. She ultimately signed a major-label deal with Polydor Records and began making preparations to release her debut album. In the meantime, she penned songs for Diana Vickers, Gabriella Climi, and others.

During the final weeks of 2009, Goulding topped the BBC's Sound of 2010, a poll conducted by British music critics and industry insiders to identify new talent. Building on that momentum, she released Lights -- a sparkling debut album that splashed Goulding's vocal flutter across a landscape of acoustic and synthesized instruments -- in March 2010. Lights topped the U.K. charts during its first week and spun off ""Starry Eyed"" as a Top Five single (it also charted well in Ireland and New Zealand). Later that year, the album was re-released as Bright Lights, featuring seven new recordings (including a cover of Elton John's ""Your Song,"" which peaked at number two).

In 2012, Goulding returned with her sophomore album, Halcyon, which showcased an even more sonically adventurous, electro-pop-infused sound. In 2013, a deluxe reissue featuring ten extra songs was released; entitled Halcyon Days, it acted as a supplement to the original release. Two of its new songs, ""Burn"" and ""How Long Will I Love You,"" were among her biggest hits. The following year, she was featured on Calvin Harris' Top Ten U.K. hit ""Outside,"" participated in Band Aid 30's update of ""Do They Know It's Christmas?,"" and entered the U.K. Top Ten once more with ""Beating Heart,"" a song released on the soundtrack for Divergent. Another soundtrack single, ""Love Me Like You Do,"" added to the success of Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015.

That same year, Goulding released her third studio album, Delirium, which featured collaborations with Max Martin, Greg Kurstin, and others. The pop-leaning Delirium included the single ""On My Mind"" and peaked at number three on the U.S. and U.K. charts. Goulding returned in 2017 on ""First Time,"" a collaboration with electronic producer Kygo.

In 2018, Goulding joined Tap Management after almost a decade with First Access Management.[107] She appeared on a collaboration with Sean Paul on his Mad Love the Prequel EP titled ""Bad Love"", released on 29 June 2018.[108]

Goulding collaborated with Diplo and Swae Lee on the single ""Close to Me"", which was released on 24 October 2018.[109] On 1 January 2019, The Guardian reported that she has been working on her fourth album, set to release in the same year.[110] On 1 March, she released the next single ""Flux"".[111] She said regarding the album, ""It's very much written by me"".[112]

On 12 April 2019, Goulding released the single ""Sixteen"".[113] Goulding said of the single, ""...That age was such a pivotal year for me in many ways and this song is so close to my heart. It takes me back to the reckless days of being a teenager and I hope it reminds us all about the innocence of youth.""[114]

Goulding released ""Hate Me"" with American rapper Juice Wrld on 26 June 2019.[115][116] It was premiered by Zane Lowe as his 'World Record' on Beats 1.[117] In July, Goulding stated that her next material to be released would be the songs ""Woman I Am"" and ""Start"".[118] In November, she released her rendition of Joni Mitchell's Christmas song ""River"", which topped the UK Singles Chart, becoming her third UK number one single and the last UK number one song of the 2010s.[119]

On 13 March 2020, Goulding released the new single ""Worry About Me"" which was created in-collaboration with Blackbear.[120] In a radio interview with Heart the same month, she revealed that the album ""kind of comes in two parts"", adding that ""the first side is something written entirely by me which was fun and I wrote most of it in New York when I was living there a few years back. I play the guitar and I play the bass and piano and then I'm singing a lot of vocals. It's very classically influenced because I love classical music. There's a lot going on, it's a big soundscape and one big film. The second half is my kind of alter ego songs.""[121] On 21 May she released single ""Power"" and on 30 June single ""Slow Grenade"" with Lauv.

Goulding released her fourth studio album, Brightest Blue, on 17 July 2020. Originally scheduled for 5 June 2020, the album's release was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album debuted at the top of the UK Album Chart, becoming Goulding's third album to do so,[122] as well as at No. 2 in Scotland.[123] It reached the top 10 in Ireland[124] as well as the top 40 in over ten countries including Australia, Germany and the United States.

Goulding announced on an Instagram Q&A that she would be releasing new music which was not part of the Brightest Blue era at the end of January 2021.[125] On 21 January, she released a collaboration with electronic duo Silk City, titled ""New Love"".[126] On 30 September, Goulding performed ""Anything Could Happen"" as part of the opening ceremony for Expo 2020, held in Dubai.[127]

On 19 June 2022, Goulding performed at Rock in Rio in Lisbon, Portugal. After the concert, she announced that she would be releasing new music in July. The following day, she blacked out all her social media profiles.[128] Back in July 2021, during an interview with Joe Wicks, she described the forthcoming album as ""a dance record. It's electronic pop, a dance thing from outer space"".[129] On 4 July 2022, she announced the release of ""Easy Lover"" featuring Big Sean, which was released on 15 July.[130] The single did not enter the UK Singles Top 100, but peaked at number 31 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart Top 100.[131] It was followed by ""All by Myself"", a collaboration between Goulding and producers Alok and Sigala, on 7 October.[132] Goulding released the single ""Let It Die"" along with its video on 19 October and announced the same day that her fifth studio album Higher Than Heaven would be released on 3 February 2023.[133][134]

147,macabre plaza,926947,14478562,"Macabre Plaza is an anonymously produced instrumental project out of Tucson, AZ.

Little is known about Macabre Plaza, as they've kept a low profile outside of distributing music. The only known source of communication the creator of the project has is a Twitter account (@MacabrePlaza) in which they randomly will tweet out once a new album is uploaded to Spotify and nothing else.  Many were quick to speculate that the project may have been created/led by Wyatt Shears, one halve of infamous band ""The Garden"" due to instances of Wyatt playing and advocating their music, and Macabre Plaza's direct affiliation with their label ""Vada Vada"".

This theory, unbeknownst to many, was false. Wyatt himself stated on twitter that Macabre Plaza is ""based in Tucson"" and that ""They are their own entity."" back in 2019 before people had even begun spreading this theory. This, although, leads us further to indulge in new possibilities about the anonymity, in which Macabre Plaza may be numerous persons instead of a singular being. That possibility though is again a shaky one, being that in the description of the YouTube version of their song ""Abandoned Plaza"" posted by the Vada Vada label, it is stated that the song had been written/composed by someone named Oreole, which can easily be interpreted as ""Oreole"" being the hidden figure behind the project all along. 

Until then, little is known about the acclaimed Macabre Plaza, and with it's swift uprise in popularity as of 2023, there is plenty of fun to be had divulging into the rabbit hole of music commonly labelled as ""elevator music"" that is produced under this moniker. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Macabre+Plaza"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

153,twice,1323055,367055960,"There are numerous artists who have performed under the name Twice:

1. TWICE (Korean: 트와이스; Japanese: トゥワイス)  is a nine-member South Korean girl group formed by JYP Entertainment through the 2015 reality show SIXTEEN. The group is composed of: Nayeon (나연), Jeongyeon (정연), Momo (모모), Sana (사나), Jihyo (지효), Mina (미나), Dahyun (다현), Chaeyoung (채영) and Tzuyu (쯔위). 

On February 11, 2015, Park Jin-young announced that the lineup of JYP Entertainment's upcoming seven-member girl group would be decided through SIXTEEN, a competition survival show that would air on Mnet later that year. The show began on May 5 and ended with Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung as the winners. Park then announced that he would be increasing the size of the group from seven members to nine by adding Tzuyu, who was the ""audience's pick"" since she was the most popular contestant by the show's end, and Momo, who was added by Park himself since he felt the group needed someone with her performance abilities. The decision was controversial at the time with many people complaining about eliminated contestants being able to join the group.

The group debuted on October 20, 2015 with the extended play The Story Begins and title track ""OOH-AHH하게"". TWICE rose to fame in 2016 with their single ""CHEER UP"" from their second mini Page Two; the song charted at number 1 on the Gaon Digital Chart and became the best-performing single of the year. It also won the title of ""Song of the Year"" at two major music awards shows: Melon Music Awards and Mnet Asian Music Awards. Their subsequent single ""TT"" from their third extended play TWICEcoaster : LANE 1 claimed the top spot for four consecutive weeks. The album was the highest selling K-pop girl group album of 2016, which sold 350,852 copies by the end of the year. Within 19 months after debut, Twice has sold over 1.2 million units of their four extended plays and special albums.

On January 3, 2017, the music video for ""TT"" hit 100 million views, becoming the fastest K-pop group music video to do so and breaking Twice's own record previously set by ""Cheer Up"". Later in that same year, ""TT"" would also become the first video by a K-pop female act to surpass 200 million views. On January 10, JYP Entertainment announced Twice's first solo concert tour within just a year and four months after debuting in October 2015. The three-day sold-out concert titled Twice 1st Tour: Twiceland – The Opening was held on February 17–19 at the SK Olympic Handball Gymnasium. A tour across Thailand and Singapore was also scheduled after the first stop in Seoul. After the Korean leg of the concert tour, Twice released a reissue of their third mini on February 20 titled TWICEcoaster: Lane 2 along with its lead single, ""Knock Knock"". The album sold 266,645 units in February 2017 alone. The title track was regarded as one of the best songs of 2017 by many critics at the end of the year.

In April, JYP Entertainment announced that Twice would be releasing a new Korean album in May before heading to Japan. On May 15, Twice released their fifth extended play SIGNAL. The title track ""Signal"" was produced by Park Jin-young, the founder of their entertainment label. This marks their first collaboration with Park. The mini contained six tracks, including ""Eye Eye Eyes""--co-written by members Jihyo and Chaeyoung—and ""Only 너 (Only You)"" written by former Wonder Girls' member HA:TFELT.

The group officially debuted in Japan on June 28, 2017 under Warner Music Japan with the release of their first compilation album titled #TWICE. The album debuted at number two on the Oricon Albums Chart, which sold 136,157 copies within seven days, the highest first week album sales of a K-pop artist in Japan in two years. In less than two months, it sold over 260,000 copies, earning it a Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of Japan.

Twice released their first full-length Korean album twicetagram on October 30, along with the music video for title track ""LIKEY"". ""LIKEY"" was composed by Black Eyed Pilseung and Jeon Gun. The album had heavy contributions from the members of Twice, who helped in composing and writing lyrics for the album's tracks. The album and its lead single debuted atop both Billboard's World Albums and World Digital Song Sales respectively—the group's first number 1, making Twice the first female K-pop act to lead on both charts. They also rose on the Heatseekers Albums as the album debuted at number 10, one position higher than Signal's peak at number 11.

170,rex orange county,1705039,101335274,"Alexander James O'Connor (born 4 May 1998), known professionally as Rex Orange County, is an English singer, multi-instrumentalist, and songwriter. O'Connor rose to prominence in 2017 following multiple features on Tyler, the Creator's Grammy-nominated album Flower Boy, including the single ""Boredom"". NPR Music journalist Zoë Jones has described O'Connor's music as ""a bright blend of hip-hop, jazz, and bedroom pop”.

Under the Rex Orange County moniker, O'Connor has released one mixtape, bcos u will never b free, and three studio albums: Apricot Princess, Pony, and Who Cares?. Both Pony and Who Cares? made the top 5 in the UK and US, and the latter topped the UK Albums Chart. O'Connor also released a live album, entitled Live at Radio City Music Hall, in 2020.

Alexander James O'Connor was born on 4 May 1998, to Nina and Phil O'Connor, a professional sports photographer. He grew up in the village of Grayshott, Hampshire near Haslemere. O'Connor's interest in music began at a young age. At age 5, O'Connor joined the choir at the school where his mother worked. He became a drummer and later taught himself piano. The name Rex Orange County is based on a teacher-given nickname, ""The OC"", after his surname O'Connor.

At age 16, O'Connor began playing the guitar and started to produce his own music using Apple's Logic software. At this age, he also began attending the BRIT School where he studied drumming and was one of four percussionists in his year; the relative rareness of his primary instrument provided him with wide exposure to various projects of others in his school which he credits with exposing him to new music.

On 4 September 2015, O'Connor self-released his debut album bcos u will never b free on SoundCloud and Bandcamp. Upon listening to the album, fellow English musician and producer Two Inch Punch got in touch with him, providing him with a management team. The two have continued to collaborate throughout O'Connor's career in the form of the tracks ""UNO"", ""Best Friend"", and ""Untitled"". The album also caught the attention of American rapper Tyler, the Creator, who sent him an email describing his enjoyment of the project. This led to him flying O'Connor out the following year to Los Angeles to collaborate on his album Flower Boy, with him co-writing and contributing vocals to the songs ""Boredom"" and ""Foreword"". On 17 November 2016, O'Connor released the single ""UNO"", a song Clash magazine described by writing, ""The buoyant keyboard riff underpins a hypnotic half-spoken vocal, one that veers from topic to topic in a hazy burst of creative mania."" On 25 January 2017, he released the single “Best Friend” (premiering on Apple Music's Beats 1 station), followed later in the year by the release of his second album Apricot Princess. His work was compared by Aimee Cliff of The Fader in 2017 to ""other artsy, post-genre teen artists, such as Kevin Abstract or Steve Lacy"".

O'Connor's first release following the success of Apricot Princess and Flower Boy was on 11 October 2017 with the single ""Loving Is Easy"", created in collaboration with the Dutch artist Benny Sings. On 16 April 2018, he performed the song in his television debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. On 31 May 2018, he released a cover of ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" in collaboration with Randy Newman, the creator of the song. He was also featured in Spotify's Rise Program.

On 9 October 2018, O'Connor was scheduled to appear on the French television program Quotidien, but refused to perform because it featured a sketch by comedian Alison Wheeler parodying the Ku Klux Klan, which he called ""tasteless"".

On 14 February 2019, O'Connor released the single ""New House"". Later that year on 12 September, he released ""10/10""; the lead single from his third album Pony. Released on 25 October 2019, Pony was his first major-label album released through RCA Records.

On 30 September 2020, O'Connor released an EP with recordings from his performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City during his Pony tour titled Live at Radio City Music Hall alongside a documentary released on YouTube. This documentary showed the events leading up to this performance as well as the early conclusion of the Pony tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In October 2020, O'Connor confirmed that he was in the process of recording a fourth studio album titled Who Cares? In January 2021, he liked a Tweet seemingly confirming that it would be released at some point later that year. However, this did not materialize. On 13 January 2022, he began officially teasing the album, sending out postcards containing a phone number that when called, a snippet of the song would play. The album was released on 11 March 2022, and was his first to top the UK Albums Chart, entering ahead of Impera by Ghost.

Growing up, O'Connor listened to Queen, ABBA, Stevie Wonder, and American alternative artists like Weezer and Green Day. He cites these artists and others as core inspirations for his own music. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Rex+Orange+County"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

171,faouzia,260248,5504918,"Born in Morocco and raised in the Canadian prairies, Faouzia combines catchy pop rhythms, heartfelt lyrics, and powerhouse vocals.

After playing hometown dates at local festivals in 2016, Faouzia’s burgeoning career started to blossom. She has since taken the stage at Toronto’s Yonge & Dundas Square for Canada’s Walk Of Fame Festival, and played one high profile event after another, wowing audiences with her heart-wrenching lyrics and magnetic stage presence.

Switching seamlessly between composing songs in English and French, Faouzia follows her well-tuned instinct when songwriting. Her first single “Knock On My Door” found its way onto regular rotation at Canadian radio, and the follow up “My Heart’s Grave” is already seeing adds in both Canada, and her native Morocco. Another accolade that the teen can add to her already impressive résumé is that of an award-winner. In early 2017, Faouzia became the first Canadian in history to win the Grand Prize award for the International Songwriting Competition, besting over 16,000 entries from137 countries, and a few short months later, was awarded the Grand Prize for the Unsigned Only Music Competition (6,000 entries from 90 countries). Faouzia was the first ever teen to win each award.

Influenced by hours spent listening to traditional Arabic music in her parents’ minivan, the songbird’s voice embodies a unique range, taking on subtle trills and stylings that combine effortlessly with contemporary pop hooks or Francophone lyrics.

1.  A Moroccan female Pop/R&B/hip-hop vocalist, originally from Kalaat Sraghna, Manal grew up in Marrakesh where she studied business and finance. Having always wanted to be a musical artist, she posted covers on YouTube and was discovered by Hamza Ait Khali, the partner of Moroccan producer DJ Van.

After a short stint with DJ Van's label Magic Castle Entertainment and the release of her debut single Denia, which earned her the 'Best Female Artist in Northern Africa' award at the Africa Music Awards in 2015, she switched management to Tarik Azzougarh, better known as Cilvaringz, producer and conceptualizer of the world's most expensive musical work ever sold, Wu-Tang Clan's Once Upon A Time in Shaolin.

Manal followed up her debut single with her song Koulchi Ban, the last song she would do with DJ Van. The release of Koulchi Ban received critical acclaim from fans and sparked the interest of Sony Music Middle East. In October 2017, Manal became one of the first Moroccan artists to sign to a major label in the Arab world.

In February 2018, Manal released her third single Taj (Crown). Due to its music video and a significant departure from Manal's signature sound, Taj started a buzz and garnered millions of views quickly. It is one of the most viewed Arabic rap songs performed by a female artist. After Taj, Manal released the song Nah featuring Moroccan rap duo Shayfeen and then had one of her biggest singles to date, Slay, in collaboration with ElGrandeToto.

In November 2019, Manal signed a distribution deal with RCA Records, a division of Sony Music France, through her record company Bench & Guess Entertainment.

Currently, she is under an exclusive license agreement with the same label, and under a music publishing agreement with Universal Music Publishing.

Manal's current management team includes Anissa Jalab, former manager of Belgian rapper Damso, head of Wagram Belgium, and also manager of ElGrandeToto.

In May 2021, Manal released her first album entitled 360, which included the hit single Niya.

Deprived of the stage during the COVID-19 pandemic, she launched, with the help of her husband Moncef Guessous, a streetwear brand called Bari & Soch.

In November 2021, Manal earned the 'Best Female Artist in Northern Africa' award at the 2021 All Africa Music Awards for the second time in her career.

In May 2022, Manal performed ""3ARI"" for COLORS. In October 2022, she was chosen to feature in Light The Sky, a song for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, collaborating with artists, RedOne, Balqees, Rahma Riad and Nora Fatehi.

Born in 1992, she was raised on the classics in the tiny town of Baskin, LA: “I knew that country music for me and my family was more than just a genre,” Wilson tells Apple Music. “It literally is what we lived.” She started writing songs before she hit her teen years and took a gig impersonating Hannah Montana in high school, eventually moving to Nashville to chase her dreams in 2011. But breakout success wouldn’t come until nearly a decade later with 2020’s thoughtful kiss-off  “Things a Man Oughta Know,” which established Wilson as a smart writer and stirring performer. Her songs might be solidly modern in production, but they also reveal Wilson’s extensive knowledge of the genre’s history, winking at her ‘90s predecessors on 2022’s “Heart Like a Truck” or revitalizing the funky ‘70s for 2024’s “Country's Cool Again,” solidifying her appeal to multiple generations. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lainey+Wilson"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

During high school, he played in several bands and studied jazz before discovering electronic music production. However, it was while attending N.Y.U. as a music tech major in 2014 that a bad breakup found Leff on his own and digging deep into his writing and recording process. Out of this period came the song ""The Other,"" co-written with songwriter/instrumentalist Michael Matosic. Released under Leff's stage name Lauv (inspired by the Latvian ""lauva"" or lion), the song went viral after gaining blog attention and peaked at number three on blog aggregator Hype Machine.

199,jj,395933,8431651,"There are at least six artists with this name:
1. A Swedish indie group
2. A solo project of musician Jacob Janoram
3. An English pop group
4. A South African rapper
5. A Dutch musician
6. K-pop girl group
7. American YouTuber who covers music

1. Swedish group jj emerged in 2009 on the Gothenburg-based record label Sincerely Yours with a particularly gratifying take on the musical preoccupations common to much of the label's roster, which includes its founders,  The Tough Alliance. jj are distributed in North America by Secretly Canadian. The band consists of Joakim Benon and Elin Kastlander.

jj's take on neo-Balearic indie pop filters Air France's tropical haze, The Tough Alliance's penchant for slyly irreverent appropriation, and The Honeydrips' fragile twee pop melodicism into a beguilingly lush, gently electronic style, reminiscent of prime Saint Etienne with a smoother, beachier sheen. jj also share their label mates' propensity for mystery, favoring an artfully enigmatic presentation. Vocalist Elin Kastlander provides a distinguishing sonic hallmark in the form of her warm, lusciously smooth alto. 

jj released their debut single jj n° 1 in early 2009. A couple of months later they released their debut album jj n° 2. Their third album, jj n° 3, was released on March 9, 2010.

In late 2010, jj released a mixtape called Kills. The first single from Kills, ""Let Them,"" sampled Akon's ""Right Now (Na Na Na)."" The single also featured a B-side entitled ""I'm The One/Money On My Mind"" that samples ""Intro"" by The xx.

Aside from their official releases, jj has also done several covers and new takes on contemporary songs. For example, they've recorded covers of Akon's ""Troublemaker,"" Jeremih's ""Birthday Sex,"" and the ""Theme Song"" for the classic 70s American tv series Welcome Back, Kotter. All of these tracks were released for free on the internet.

2. Brace yourself, North America – slosh rock is coming. Intrepid guitarist, singer and songwriter JJ Hendrix is mixing and mashing genres to concoct his own blend of musical intoxication which latches on to the listener and refuses to let go. Armed with a seemingly endless satchel of guitar solos and a knack for combining searing riffs with funky, grooving beats, this is the refreshing burst of danceable, yet imaginative rock the scene has been thirsting for.

Hailing from Ontario, JJ continues to make a name for himself throughout the indie music circuit thanks to his eclectic, yet trademark sound that drips and oozes from each and every song he pens. The far majority of his creations are instrumental, allowing the music to do the talking while the listener immerses themselves into the world of slosh rock. Driven by “creativity in its pristine state,” this unique style feeds off the unbridled, rampant inspiration and experimentation embodied by JJ himself.

Joined by Brad Heatherly on drums, Yeruvim Krantsky on guitar and bassist Al Finter, JJ’s Music Retaliation continues to roll on, releasing their latest single “Grunky Gillers and the Fillers” through CD Baby and other digital retailers. With influences from Jimi Hendrix, as well as the blues and rock greats of yesterday and today, the foursome continues to carve out their own niche within the industry. Serving as a small sampling of what’s to come, the single drives sole songwriter JJ to write and record for the group’s upcoming full-length album.

JJ Hendrix earned his nickname from musician and producer Scott Hill of Astranova Records, who recorded with former Black Sabbath keyboardist and producer for Robert Plant, Jez Woodroffe. The pair collaborated on a well-received record Ancient Future in 2010. He released his solo debut Return Regalia in 2008, which generated thousands of plays via Spotify and Last.fm.

JJ’s Music Retaliation’s new single “Grunky Gillers and the Fillers” is available to purchase through CD Baby now, as well as JJ’s full-length Return Regalia. Check him out on ReverbNation to sample some of the delectably fun slosh rock that continues to emanate from his guitar amp today.

1)  Uzi was a duo that consisted of Gab3 and Mik3 aka Young Forever.

2) Uzi (pronounced as ""Uji"") is a Japanese hip-hop artist. He has released four major albums, most recently his “Natural 9” album released in March 2008. Uzi is one of the rappers to incorporate more overt elements of Japanese culture into his music and videos, specifically aspects referring to the samurai (to which he claims direct ancestry). He is a great example of an artist who maintains the localization of hip-hop music through his dependence on the incorporation of Japanese themes into his work. Such non-Americanization of his hip-hop music has been met with varying opinions; some view this as disrespectful of the origins of hip-hop culture, while there are those who appreciate Uzi’s apparent embracing of Japanese culture. 

3) 3) Hard rock band from Chicago (who later moved to L.A.) in the 90's .. see Üzi.

4) The American Uzi was a ten-handed combo that burned briefly but brightly in the fertile post-Burma Boston music scene of the mid-1980's. Its founding members were drummer Danny Lee and guitarist/singer/lyricist Thalia Zedek. The basic stylistic conflict between Thalia's garage-based rock 'n' roll background and Danny's more high-tech, modernistic approach gave the group much of its unique edge and led, as well, to its early demise.

Lee and Zedek were joined in late 1983 by bassist Randy Barnwell, guitar-effects whiz Bob Young, and tape specialist Phil Milstein. Barnwell was replaced by Craig Federhen for a brief basement interlude, but returned before Uzi's first show and continued with them for the bulk of the band's duration.

Sleep Asylum was recorded sporadically between 1984-85, including a period when Uzi was between bass players and used Dave Shibler in a session role. Irv Ziskind became the group's final bassist just after Sleep Asylum was completed. His addition cemented Uzi's lineup and provoked them to a new songwriting peak, but Zedek and Lee found themselves moving further and further into their respective corners. Uzi was dismatled just before Sleep Asylum's release in the spring of '86, and never did get to record another album's worth of great material they had written.

Uzi's breakup caught Homestead Records holding the bag on yet another of its many posthumous releases. Consequently, in spite of initial critical acclaim, Sleep Asylum never reached much beyond the East coast of the U.S. Once out of print, continuing word-of-mouth delivered Sleep Asylum to its current status as one of those records heard of more than heard.

Bu mahlas İspanyollardan gelmekteydi. Mahlasında değişiklik arayan UZI, en sonunda bir abisi tarafından “Bu çocuk rap yaparken tarıyor” demesinden esinlenerek mahlasını “UZI” olarak belirlemiştir.

2018 yılında M.O.B bünyesine katıldıktan sonra parçalarını Lil Murda ile birlikte “GNG” isminde yayınladılar. GNG olarak ilk albümünü “Output Nr.1” isminde yayınlayıp büyük bir ivme yakaladılar. Albümün çıkış parçası “Hızlı Sokaklar” ise büyük ilgi toplayarak UZI‘nin yükselmesine basamak olmuştur.

Daha sonrasında GNG grubunu ayıran UZI, müziğine tek başına devam etme kararı almıştır. 2019 yılında “Favela” adlı EP albümü piyasaya süren UZI, “Favela” parçasıyla global playlistlere girerek gözleri üstüne çekmeyi başarmıştır.

2020 yılında ise yayınladığı teklilerle Türkçe Sözlü Rap müziğe hızlı giren UZI, yılın sonuna doğru “Makina” şarkısını çıkararak ülke çapında büyük bir işe imza atmıştır.

216,elissa,80729,1649544,"Elissa (Arabic: إليسا) was born in Deir Al-Amar, Lebanon and raised amidst the spectacular natural scenery of the Bekaa Valley. She holds a degree in Political Science from the Lebanese University. Her first forays into art and artistic activities consisted of acting in theaters of political critique, namely with well-known chansonnier Wassim Tabbara, and the Theatre de 10 Heures. This was the first time she came in contact with an audience, whose overwhelming warmth and energy she immediately took a shining to.

Her theatrical beginnings motivated her to move to singing. In 1992, she appeared on LBC's Studio Al Fan talent show. Elissa won a silver medal over the course of her stay on the program. Following this, she performed in concert tirelessly until 1999, when Lido Productions released her first album, Baddy Doub. Elissa's debut on the commercial music scene was definitely an event of considerable importance.

The album was a success and featured a smash hit with famous French gypsy act, Gerard Ferrer. The release of this first album took her straight to Cannes, to participate in the International Music Festival of 2000. Following this first success, Elissa then released her second album, W'akherta Ma'ak which in turn included the hit duet Betghib Betrouh, sung with Lebanese superstar Ragheb Alameh. It was a massive hit, and is still played on radio and TV today, over three years after its initial release. Elissa's album, Ayshalak, has been the number one selling album in the Middle East since its release in June 2002.

For this album, Elissa took advantage of the high momentum of her previous two albums, and managed to reach an even higher level of stardom. The video clip of the album's hit single, also entitled Ayshalak, was filmed in Paris with acclaimed French director Fabrice Begotti. Elissa was officially dressed and made up by Christian Dior Paris for the entire duration of the shoot. This was the first time the illustrious French designer collaborated with an Arab artist. 2002 brought Elissa more consecration with the winning of the Murex d'Or award for best female artist.

Hot on the heels of the outstanding Ayshalak, Elissa shook the music scene further by teaming up with world-famous Irish singer Chris De Burgh. Needless to say, the collaboration of these two talents resulted in the historic duet Lebanese Night, which is featured on De Burgh's 2002 album, Timing is Everything. To crown the year, Elissa was included in the 100 Pioneers of Lebanon anthology book, alongside artists such as Fairuz, Wadih al-Safi, and other personalities who have left their mark on the Lebanese cultural, political and social landscape.

Elissa’s fourth album, Ahla Donya was released in 2004. This was one of the fastest selling albums ever in the Arab world. The album included a variety of songs, such as Kol Youm Fi Omri, Erga' Lel Shou', Hobbak Waja' (Inta Lamin) and Ahla Dounya. The album received a 2005 World Music Award for best selling album in the Middle East and North Africa. In 2005, a Special Collector's Edition of the record was made available (1000 copies) with state-of-the-art packaging including a mini-biography.

In early 2006, Elissa released her fifth studio effort, the album Bastanak, which has sold nearly 3.7 million copies, according to Rotana. In 2006 Elissa again won the World Music Award for best selling Middle Eastern artist for Bastanak.

She is best known for being a semifinalist in the second season of The Voice: la plus belle voix in France with Louis Bertignac as a coach. She later got a role in La Famille Bélier which won her a César Award.

In 2008, 12-year-old Louane Emera took part in L'École des stars, a French music competition broadcast on channel Direct 8.

Louane Emera is an orphan. Her rendition of ""Imagine"" was dedicated to her father who had died just three months prior to her appearance in The Voice. Although a celebrity, she is still at school aiming to take her baccalauréat exams in 2015.

In 2013, her first real breakout came with her taking part in The Voice: la plus belle voix's second season. She auditioned with ""Un homme heureux"" from William Sheller with all four coaches Florent Pagny, Jenifer, Louis Bertignac and Garou turning their chairs. She opted to be part of Team Louis Bertignac. Her ""blind audition"" episode was broadcast on February 16, 2013.

But her luck ended in the semi-finals after her rendition of ""Quelqu'un m'a dit"" from Carla Bruni. She brought a cumulative score of 74 while the other Team Bertignac semi-finalist Loïs brought in a composite score of 76. Accordingly Louane was eliminated finishing 5th to 8th.

All semi-finalists and finalists, including Louane, took part in an after-season tour throughout France.

Her first studio solo album, Chambre 12, was released on March 2, 2015, to great success.

218,red velvet,1113117,196622717,"There are three artists who go by Red Velvet:

1) Red Velvet (레드벨벳) is a five-member South Korean girl group formed by SM Entertainment in 2014. The group consists of Irene (아이린), Seulgi (슬기), Wendy (웬디), Joy (조이), and Yeri (예리). Their name is a play on their dual concept of ""red"" and ""velvet;"" the ""red"" half is their brighter and bubblier side, while their ""velvet"" image is their softer, more mature and elegant concept.

Debuting in 2014, Red Velvet was originally a four-member group. Three of the original four members of Red Velvet were previously part of S.M. Entertainment's pre-debut team, SM Rookies. Seulgi, the first member who joined the agency, was brought in through an audition in 2007. Irene, the next member to join the company, was cast in 2009. Joy, the member who wasn't part of SM Rookies, auditioned through the SM Global Audition in Seoul in 2012. As part of SM Rookies, several clips of Irene and Seulgi were released on S.M. Entertainment's official YouTube account. The three members were rumored to debut as a group in July 2014, which was then later confirmed by SM Entertainment. With the addition of member Joy, the four-member group would debut as Red Velvet - SM Entertainment's first girl group in five years, after f(x).

Red Velvet's debut single ""행복 (Happiness)"" was digitally released on August 4, 2014. The music video was released on August 1, and later become the second most viewed K-pop video worldwide in August 2014; on the same day, the group made their official debut stage on the music program Music Bank.

Red Velvet released their second digital single ""Be Natural"" on October 13, 2014. It is a remake of a song by veteran SM Entertainment girl group, S.E.S.. The track features Taeyong, former member of SM Rookies' male unit named SR14B, as well as a member of NCT. The group started their promotional activities for this release on October 9, making their first appearance on the music program, M! Countdown. The music video for the song was released on the same day.

On March 11, 2015, SM Entertainment released a video announcing the addition of a new member to the group's lineup—Yeri. On March 14, ""Automatic,"" the group's first music video featuring Yeri, was released. The following day, they released their first mini-album ""Ice Cream Cake"", along with the music video for ""Ice Cream Cake."" It was also announced by S.M. Entertainment that both ""Automatic"" and ""Ice Cream Cake"" would be promoted as double lead singles of the album. 

In early September 2015, S.M. Entertainment announced that the group would be making a comeback, and on September 9, 2015, Red Velvet released their first full length album ""The Red"". The album features ten tracks, including the title track, ""Dumb Dumb."" The album focuses on their ""red"" image, which is supposed to be the group's bright and bold side. On December 18, 2015, the group took part in S.M. Entertainment's special winter project, Winter Garden, alongside label-mates f(x) and BoA, releasing a digital single titled ""세가지 소원 (Wish Tree).""

While promoting ""The Red"", it was hinted at by the members and S.M. Entertainment that there would be a follow up album, but nothing was confirmed at that time. In March 2016, it was announced that the group would make a comeback with the group's second mini album. ""The Velvet"" was released on March 17, 2016 as a direct follow up to their first album ""The Red"". While ""The Red' focuses on the ""red"" half of the group's image, ""The Velvet' focuses on the group's smooth and soft ""velvet"" image. The title track, ""7월 7일 (One Of These Nights),"" is described as an R&B ballad. On March 27, 2016, the group performed the track on music show Inkigayo.

On September 7, 2016, Red Velvet released their third mini-album ""Russian Roulette"". The mini album features seven tracks, including the title track of the same name, ""러시안 룰렛 (Russian Roulette)"".

""Peek-a-Boo"" peaked at #2 on Billboard's World Digital Songs chart. In South Korea, the album and the single ""Peek-a-Boo"" both charted at #2 on the Gaon Album Chart and Gaon Digital Chart.

On January 29, 2018, Red Velvet released a repackage of their previous album titled ""The Perfect Red Velvet"", consisting of three new songs, including title track ""Bad Boy.""

On July 19, 2018, Red Velvet announced they would be making a comeback soon and had already filmed their music video outdoors in Gyeonggi-do. Excitement was stirred after the announcement of an English language version of previous single ""Bad Boy."" The songs from the new album were performed during Red Velvet's concert Redmare. They released their sixth extended play ""Summer Magic"" on August 6, 2018. The extended play contained seven tracks, including the title track ""Power Up"" and a bonus track of their popular song ""Bad Boy"" recorded in English. The album peaked at #1 on the Gaon Album Chart. 

After the release of ""Summer Magic"", news about Red Velvet's upcoming comeback circulated in October 2018, which SM Entertainment responded to by confirming a November comeback. SM Entertainment later revealed the details of the extended play along with the title of the lead single: ""RBB (Really Bad Boy).""

The third and final entry of the trilogy, ""The ReVe Festival: Finale"" was a compilation of the previous two EPs and contained four new songs, including the chart-topping lead single ""Psycho."" This would be the group's latest comeback for over a year.

On July 6, 2020, the group's first sub-unit was formed. Red Velvet - Irene & Seulgi released their first mini album with ""Monster"" as the title track. The album also featured a solo song for the group's lead vocalist, Seulgi. On July 19, they dropped a single titled ""Naughty."" It was remixed soon afterwards.

On January 1, 2021, their company, SM Entertainment, hosted the Culture Humanity free online concert featuring many of their artists. Red Velvet returned as five after the member Wendy had been on hiatus for a year because of injuries and Irene had been absent for weeks due to controversy. The group preformed songs including ""Peek-a-Boo"" and ""Bad Boy."" The long-anticipated five-member performance of their hit track ""Psycho"" was also performed.

Before the group returned as five, Wendy was announced to be debuting as a solo artist. On April 5, 2021,  ""Like Water"" was released, which included two lead singles: ""Like Water"" and ""When This Rain Stops.""

Member Joy also debuted as a solo artist with a title track and remake album titled ""Hello"". It released on May 31, 2021.

The five-member group's long-anticipated 6th mini-album ""Queendom"" was released on August 17, 2021. The title track ""Queendom"" was described as ""a pop dance song with the message that we are all 'queens' of our lives, and that together we shine more beautifully.""

Their first release of 2022, ""Feel My Rhythm,"" was released on March 21, marking the return of The ReVe Festival. The mini album consisted of 6 songs, the title track sampling ""Aria on the G String."" The song effortlessly mixes elegant classical music with a modern, upbeat pop sound.

As the third member of the group to debut solo, Seulgi released her first EP  ""28 Reasons,"" on October 4, 2022, alongside the title track of the same name.

The group has been endlessly praised for their diverse concepts and uniqueness. In November 2019, Billboard crowned Red Velvet as ""the best idol group alive."" The group has now surpassed their tenth anniversary, and Red Velvet continues to captivate and gain recognition domestically and around the world from their fans, ReVeluv (레벨업), as well as casual listeners alike.

He released his first albums under the Jovanotti byname to later switch into his real name (Lorenzo), as of the mid-nineties. 

Most of his output is hip-hop influenced, although not most of his work should be viewed as hip hop music per se. Many of his songs are not hip hop related and may probably be best viewed as part of the earlier Italian cantautore tradition. Some of his earlier work is also closer to keyboard-heavy 1980s pop. Most of his songs are sung in the Italian language; he also released a Spanish-language greatest hits album. His live album includes a short version of the Sugarhill Gang's ""Rapper's Delight"". Jovanotti appears on several international compilations, most notably Red Hot + Rhapsody, a 1998 tribute to George Gershwin, on which he performed ""I Got Rhythm"". Jovanotti has also appeared in one Luciano Pavarotti's charity concert in 1996.

His CD, Buon Sangue, includes influences from both rock and old school hip hop. It is one of his most innovative works to date. Edoardo Bennato collaborated on one track, while bass player Saturnino co-wrote two of the songs.

One of his most recent CDs, ""Ora"", breaks new ground with a new style of production. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Jovanotti"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

237,bigbang,707200,29491513,"There are two artists with the name Bigbang:

1. Korean hip-hop/pop group 
2. Norwegian rock band

1. BIGBANG (빅뱅) is a three-piece Hip-Hop/R&B group from Seoul, South Korea. The group was created by YG Entertainment, through a long audition process which aired on TV as a 10 episode documentary. They made their debut at the YG Family 10th Anniversary Concert on August 19th, 2006.

BIGBANG has been labelled as the Revolutionary Group of Korean Music Wave for their unique urban-originated music and fashion style. The members' involvement in composing and producing their own music, most notably G-Dragon's, has earned them respect and praise from music industry experts.

During their first year, BIGBANG was criticized for being ""too short"" and ""too ugly"" for an idol group. Sales from their early hip-hop singles and first studio album BigBang Vol. 1 were disappointing. The group's turning point came with their hit song Lies, which stayed at number one on Korean charts for a record-breaking seven consecutive weeks. Their follow up releases, Hot Issue and Stand Up, furthered their success, spawning hits such as Last Farewell and Haru Haru. 
From 2007 to 2008, BIGBANG received many awards, including ""Best Male Group"", ""Song of the Year"", ""Artist of the Year"", and the Grand Award at the Seoul Music Awards.

From 2009 to 2010, BIGBANG expanded their endeavors to Japan, and were voted ""the Korean group that Japanese fans wish to see the most"". They became the first foreign group awarded to receive the ""Best Newcomer"" award from the Japan Cable Broadcasting Station and ""Best New Artist"" at MTV Japan. Amidst their Japanese group promotions, the members branched out to do solo activities. Taeyang, G-Dragon, and Seungri have released solo albums. G-Dragon and T.O.P also collaborated on an album under the sub-unit GD & TOP. Seungri and Daesung have acted in both TV dramas and musicals. T.O.P became a highly acclaimed film / TV drama star. Daesung hosted many of Korea's most popular variety TV shows.

After nearly a two-year hiatus in Korea, BIGBANG reunited in 2011 with their successful album Tonight. However, promotions were cut short when multiple members encountered legal issues. In November 2011, representing the Asia-Pacific region, BIGBANG emerged as the inaugural ""Best Worldwide Act"" winner at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards. This was the first time in six months where all five members were seen together. In 2012, Big Bang released their 5th Mini Album Alive in Korea and Japan. Later they embarked on their first ever World Tour visiting 25 cities in 16 countries.

Fans of BIGBANG are known as VIPs. Their official light stick is a signature yellow crown, which reflects BIGBANG's title as the Kings.

Members:
G-Dragon / G-드래곤 (Kwon Ji-Yong 권지용; Leader, Rapper, Vocals)
Taeyang (태양) / Sol (Dong Young-bae 동영배; Lead Vocals, Rapper)
Daesung (대성) / D-Lite (Kang Daesung 강대성; Vocals)

Former members:
T.O.P / Tempo (Choi Seung-hyun 최승현; Rapper, Beatbox, Vocals)
Seungri/V.I (Lee Seung-Hyun vocals, dancer)

2. BigBang is a Norwegian rock band led by frontman Øystein Greni. Over several years the band lineup has altered several times while remaining a trio, with Greni remaining the one constant member. Though the band name spelling is inconsistent, it is usually styled as BigBang.

BigBang were formed in 1992 by Øystein Greni, Erik Tresselt and Christer Engen. Throughout the years the band's line-up has changed several times. As of 2007  it consists of Øystein Greni, Olaf Olsen (who joined in 1999) and Lasse Weeden. Øystein Greni is the only person who has always been a member of the band, and he is also commonly seen as the band's front figure, as he writes almost all the songs as well as being the lead vocalist and guitarist. Greni has been in much dispute by some of the former members of the band, saying that he is a musical tyrant with a singular path and anyone who doesn't follow the same road he does, he simply fires.

The band hit it big with the song Girl In Oslo and in this song and most of BigBangs later material the prominent feature is lyrics with directly translated norwegian figures of speech and powerful imagery. A staple of a BigBang song is the catchy guitar and bass riff along with the metaphorically compact lyrics.

Dubbed Norway’s Greatest Live Band, BigBang are known for their thrilling performances and have been a major force in the Norwegian music scene for over a decade. In 2007, the band moved to California to focus on the American market. They toured the country, playing intimate gigs and promoting their American début From Acid to Zen, a compilation of songs from previously released albums. 

After their 2013 album The Oslo Bowl, Øystein Greni began to work on a solo project for several years. His album Pop Noir was released on 24 March 2017, with the Norwegian band suggesting on their Facebook page that it featured a collaboration with 'G-Dragon on ""You Got IT""!'  (probably as a joke).

238,yoasobi,665204,39766786,"YOASOBI (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese music duo composed of vocaloid music producer Ayase and vocalist Ikura (幾田りら/Lilas Ikuta). The group has released four music videos, all of which are based on short stories posted on Monogatary, a website operated by Sony Music Japan, later also from various novels and book tie-ups.

The name ""YOASOBI"" originates from the Japanese word 夜遊び, meaning ""nightlife"". Ayase, who is a producer of the group said he named it as a wish that he could take on various playful challenges by comparing the appearance of acting as an individual to the appearance of daytime and the appearance of two people acting as YOASOBI as the appearance of the night.

The group has a slogan ""novel into music"" (小説を音楽にする, shōsetsu o ongaku ni suru), , which goes along with their amazing ability to create songs with incredibly meaningful lyrics, especially when it comes to their themes for various anime and games.

2019-2020: Formation and rising up with ""Yoru ni Kakeru""
Both members of YOASOBI had active music careers prior to forming the group. Ayase gained a following on the video hosting site Niconico since his first upload on 24 December 2018, a song titled Sentensei Assault Girl (先天性アサルトガール). On 23 November 2019, he released an EP, Yūrei Tōkyō (幽霊東京), which reached third on iTunes' album chart. Ikuta, performing under the name Rira Ikuta (幾田りら), had already released two EPs: Rerise in 2017 and Jukebox in 2019.

The first song released by the duo was ""Yoru ni Kakeru"", based on Mayo Hoshino's short story ""Thanatos no Yūwaku"" hosted on Monogatary. The music video was released first on 16 November 2019, where it broke 10 million views in five months on YouTube as well as being popular on TikTok. It was subsequently released as a single on 15 December 2019, where it topped the popularity charts on both Spotify and Line Music. More than five months after its release, the single would top the Billboard Japan Hot 100 on 1 June 2020.

Following the success of their first release, on 18 January 2020, YOASOBI released their second single, ""Ano Yume o Nazotte"", this time based on Sōta Ishiki's ""Yume no Shizuku to Hoshi no Hana"". On 20 April 2020, Yoasobi released a teaser for their third single, ""Halzion"", which is based on Shunki Hashizume's ""Soredemo, Happy End"". ""Halzion"" marked the first time that YOASOBI collaborated with a professional novelist, whereas the first two were amateur writers. The single was released as a promotional project by Suntory to advertise their new energy drink named Zone. The single was official released on 11 May 2020.

In the second half of the year, Yoasobi released their fourth song, ""Tabun"", on July 20. The song was based on the short story of the same name by Shinano.[15] Their fifth song, ""Gunjō"" was released September 1. The song collaborated with a manga, Blue Period for Bourbon's Alfort Mini Chocolate advertisement. The song was based on Alfort's television advertisement story text Ao o Mikata ni.[16] On December 18, the duo released their sixth song, ""Haruka"", based on Osamu Suzuki's novel, Tsuki Ōji.[17]

On December 31, 2020, they debuted in 71st NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen and performed ""Yoru ni Kakeru"", which is also their first live performance. 

2021–present: The Book
On January 6, 2021, Yoasobi released their first extended play and first physical release The Book, which included the six previous songs and three new songs, ""Encore"" as a lead single, ""Epilogue"" as an intro, and ""Prologue"" as an outro.[19] The duo also released their seventh song, ""Kaibutsu"", on the same day.[20] The song has been featured as the opening theme song for the second season of the anime television series Beastars.[21] The anime's ending theme song and duo's eighth song, ""Yasashii Suisei"", was released on January 20.[22] Both were released as a double A-side single in physical format on March 24.[23]

On January 20, the duo opened their fan club website ""Club Yoasobi"" (CLUB 夜遊)[24] and announced that they would hold their first concert, Keep Out Theater on February 14[25] at the inside of the building under construction at the former site of Shinjuku Milano for an online audience of 40,000 people.[26]

The duo released the ninth song for the Fuji TV's morning show Mezamashi TV, titled ""Mō Sukoshi Dake"" on May 10, and was based on a novel Meguru, which won the Yoasobi Contest Vol.3 with Mezamashi TV by Chiharu.[27] ""Sangenshoku"", an upcoming tenth song for the advertisement for the NTT Docomo's mobile service Ahamo, was based on a novel RPG by scriptwriter Yūichirō Komikado.[28] It will be released in the early summer of 2021.

244,alex velea,17742,280544," Alex s-a nascut pe data de 13 mai 1984 in Craiova.  O zi norocoasa pentru parintii sai :). Zodia TAURULUI i se potriveste PERFECT, Alex fiind un tanar  pasional, gelos, usor incapatant, plin de ambitie si perseverenta,  care stie ca prin munca poti sa iti atingi visele. 
         DRAGOSTEa LA PRIMA VEDERE pentru muzica i-a fost insuflata de parinti, in special de tatal sau, care este muzician, si carora Alex nu ezita sa le spuna tot  timpul « ITI MULTUMESC ». Parintii sunt un punct de echilibru in viata lui, Alex crezand cel mai tare in obiectivitatea lor.   
         Pasiunea pentru muzica si-a descoperit-o de mic dar in mod organizat Alex canta de la 9 ani iar la 11 ani a devenit elev al Palatului Copiilor. De la varsta de 16 ani, studiaza timp de 4 ani canto clasic. Alex se considera un mare norocos pentru ca « meseria » lui coincide cu ce iubeste mai mult in viata: muzica.-  DOAMNA MEA este muzica. 
         Un punct de sprijin in viata lui Alex sunt si prietenii sai, care il sustin neconditionat si il incurajeaza sa mearga mai departe. Unul dintre cei mai buni prieteni ii este Smiley cel care este producator alaturi de Marius Moga al albumului de debut semnat Alex, « YAMASHA ».  Alex isi demonstreaza polivalenta si admiratia pentru mai multe genuri muzicale  si prin colaborarile pe care le-a avut pana acum: Anda Adam, Connect-R, Matteo pentru piesa 2NIGHT, C.I.A, Sisu& Puya, Mandinga, Anna Lesko, etc. 
          Album sau de debut  lansat in toamna 2006, « YAMASHA » se vrea si o declaratie din partea lui Alex : « Piesele acestea ma descopera in fata publicului… Asta sunt eu…Am incercat sa pun pe note ganduri, sentimente, trairi…YAMASHA ma reprezinta ».  Pentru YAMASHA,  Alex a colaborat cu Smiley, Marius Moga, Connect- R, Mattteo, Don Baxter, adica cu mare parte din prietenii sai. Desi s-a mutat in Bucuresti de ceva timp, Alex nu si-a uitat prietenii din Craiova asa incat pentru piesa ORICE MINUT, a colaborat cu Byga de la CIA. Ritmurile latino si caliente sunt aduse de colaborarea cu Mandinga pe piesa CAND SUNT CU TINE. CE N-AS DA si JURNALUL UNEI FETE sunt alte doua cantece dragi lui Alex. Rezultatul este un album de 10 piese, o combinatie de R&B, hip hop si pop. 
           Pentru primul single de pe album, piesa YAMASHA compusa de Marius Moga si Smiley, textul fiind semnat chiar de Alex., s-a filmat un videoclip in plina vara 2006 regia apartinandu-i  unui alt bun prieten, Iulian Moga. 
           Filmarile au durat 16 ore, intreaga echipa suportand cu brio canicula si galagia facuta de cei care s-au adunat pentru a vedea ce se intampla la ei in cartier. Primele cadre s-au tras in Pasajul englezesc, intr-o atmosfera tipic sud-americana, personajele principale fiind Alex si Irina- protagonista telenovelei  „Secretul Mariei”, de la Antena 1. Cei doi au trait o adevarata poveste de dragoste, de-a lungul celor 16 ore de filmare. 
           Urmatoarea locatie a fost subsolul Teatrului National, spatiul fiind invadat de peste o suta de oameni, figuranti si membrii echipei de filmare 
De la inregistrare nu au lipsit prietenii lui Alex: Marius Moga, Smiley, Connecte-R, Puya, Matteo si C.I.A, o trupa de baieti din Craiova, pe toti urmand sa-i vedem si in videoclip. . 
            O data adunata intreaga gasca, petrecerea a inceput... pe bune. Lumea a uitat de camerele de filmat si de adevaratul motiv pentru care s-au adunat.
Timpul liber Alex si-l petrece in sala de repetitii, la sala de forta sau…. pe drumul dintre Bucuresti si Craiova. Desi  fire boema, atunci cand a terminat liceul, Alex a ales o facultate practica.. este student la Electromecanica anul IV. 
 Numaratoarea inversa a inceput si mai e foarte putin pana cand veti avea avea ocazia sa faceti cunostinta cu noul single Alex -  DRAGOSTE LA PRIMA VEDERE!!!!

Durk’s early career was, like many drill artists, plagued with legal issues and accusations of violence. These issues eventually led to his shows being canceled.

In 2012, his career took off with the release of “L’s Anthem” and its French Montana-featuring remix. In 2013, he continued his hot streak with “Dis Ain’t What U Want,” a conscious reflection on his perception in the media and throughout his city. In 2015, he released his debut studio album Remember My Name and the viral sensation, “My Beyoncé” with DeJ Loaf.

Between 2016 and 2020, Durk went on to drop several new installments of his series Signed to the Streets and Just Cause Y’all Waited. At the same time, he faced renewed legal challenges stemming from an Atlanta shooting. Regardless of the circumstances, he persisted, gaining yet another viral hit as a feature on Drake’s “Laugh Now Cry Later.” He also gained traction with the Lil Baby and Polo G assisted “3 Headed Goat.”

The scars of violence run deep in Durk’s discography, particularly stemming from the loss of OTF members Nunu (Nuski) and King Von at the hands of gunfire. Both artists are memorialized on his album The Voice, for which a deluxe version was released in 2021. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Lil+Durk"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
