4,cano,22392,486983,"CANO is a Franco-Ontarian folk-pop collective which was active from 1975 until 1985. While Wikipedia claims that CANO was ""progressive"", the band itself describes its style as a mix of folk, rock, and jazz (see www.canomusique.com).

The name comes from the Coopérative des artistes du Nouvel Ontario (CANO), an agricultural and artistic commune established in Sudbury, Ontario.

On stage, CANO was able to produce a level of intensity only comparable to a symphonic orchestra. They did not only produce the most European music in America in their era (which may have hurt their success chances in the U.S.), they did so while bridging the tremendous cultural gap between French and English Canada by including members from both parts and singing in both languages.

Members of the band are singer André Paiement (died in 1978), violinist Wasyl Kohut (died in 1981), guitarists Marcel Aymar and David Burt, bassist John Doerr, pianist Michel Kendel, and drummer Michel Dasti.

9,omega,281155,3000301,"The are at least 8 artists called Omega
1. A Hungarian rock band
2. An alias of techno musician Naoki
3. A Lithuanian pop group
4. An American rapper
5. A dubstep artist
6. A British metal band
7. A Greek black/thrash/speed metal band
8. A Dominican mambo singer
9. A Chilean rapper
10. An Italian black/avantgarde/ambient metal band

1. Omega is one of the most successful Hungarian rock bands. Formed in Budapest, Hungary in September, 1962 by the winds player László Benkő on vocal, piano and flute and János Kóbor as a lead singer and rhythm guitarist, they initially performed covers of British and American rock songs, with frequently changing the lineup of members. In 1967 Tamás Mihály came on bass, Gábor Presser joined on keyboards and began writing original music for the band (in 1968 György Molnár became a lead guitarist), releasing three LPs before leaving the band with József Laux, a drummer from 1962, to form Locomotív GT. These first albums were heavily influenced by the music of The Beatles, but they also looked forward to the band's future more progressive, space-rock style. After Presser and Laux's departure, the band found a new drummer (Ferenc Debreceni came from group Neoton Familia) and pointed Benkő as the main keyboardist, creating the current lineup, which has remained the same for over 30 years:

    * János Kóbor (""Mecky""), lead vocals
    * György Molnár (""Elefánt""), guitars
    * László Benkő (""Laci""), keyboards, vocals
    * Tamás Mihály (""Misi""), bass, vocals
    * Ferenc Debreceni (""Ciki""), drums

This lineup of Omega released ten more albums from 1972 to 1987. Many of these were released both in Hungarian and in English, in the hopes of generating wider interest in their music. However, the contents of the English albums often differed from their Hungarian counterparts, sometimes assembling tracks from several different albums and nearly always changing the song order. Following a few years of inactivity, the band reunited in 1994, with former member Gábor Presser joining them at concerts and contributing several tracks to 1995's Trans And Dance.

Omega has achieved modest international success through releases in multiple languages, and tours in England and Germany in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s. Their 1969 song ""Gyöngyhajú lány"" became an international hit, and was later covered by Scorpions on a 1995 live release, with new lyrics and the title ""White Dove"" (the Hungarian title officially was translated as ""Pearls In Her Hair"").

Omega's latest (16th) Hungarian studio release is 2006’s Égi jel (""Celestial Sign""), and their latest English release is 1996's Transcendent. In spring and summer of 2006, they performed their ""EurOmega 2006"" tour, including concerts in Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Germany.

17,drake,5937684,835585752,"Aubrey ""Drake"" Graham (born October 24, 1986) is an Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and businessman. Drake was an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s. Intent on pursuing a career in music, he left the series in 2007 after releasing his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.

Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum. His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same, were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late and collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both of which earned platinum certification in the U.S. His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records. The dancehall-influenced album sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over 10 years. The album's second single, ""One Dance"", topped the charts in several countries, and became his first number-one single as a lead artist. That year, Drake led both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts simultaneously for eight weeks.

Views achieved quadruple platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. It became Drake's best-selling album to date. Its lead single ""Hotline Bling"" peaked at number two on the Hot 100 and received Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song, as well as ""One Dance"" which was proclaimed the song of the summer in 2016. In 2017, he released the ""playlist"" More Life. It became his seventh consecutive number one on the Billboard 200, and set multiple streaming records. A year later, he released the double album Scorpion, which also broke several streaming records, and contains the Grammy Award winning number-one single ""God's Plan"", and the bounce-infused number one singles ""Nice for What"" and ""In My Feelings"".

Among the world's best-selling music artists, with over 170 million records sold worldwide, he is ranked by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) as the world's highest-certified digital singles artist. Drake holds several Billboard chart records. He has the most charted songs (205) among solo artists in the history of the Billboard Hot 100, the most simultaneously charted Hot 100 songs in a single week (27), the most time on the Hot 100 (431 weeks) and the most Hot 100 debuts in a week (22). He also has the most number one singles on the Hot Rap Songs, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay and Rhythmic Charts. Drake has also won four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, twenty-seven Billboard Music Awards and three Juno Awards. As an entrepreneur, Drake has founded the OVO Sound record label with longtime collaborator 40 in 2012.

Early life
Drake attended both Forest Hill Collegiate Institute (left) and Vaughan Road Academy (right) during high school.
Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African American and a practicing Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee, and worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis. Drake's mother, Sandra ""Sandi"" Graham (née Sher), is an Ashkenazi Jewish Canadian who worked as an English teacher and florist. His parents met after Dennis performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he first interacted with Sandra, who was in attendance. He is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. In his youth, Drake attended a Jewish day school, and formally celebrated becoming a Bar Mitzvah in a religious service.

Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto, while his father returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of years on drug-related charges. Dennis' limited finances and legal issues caused him to remain in the United States until Drake's early adulthood. Prior to his arrest, however, Dennis would travel to Toronto and bring Drake to Memphis every summer. His father later collaborated with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song titled ""Drake's Dad"". Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used to sell records, which Drake vehemently denies.

Drake was raised in two Toronto neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end until grade six, playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighborhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move, Drake replied, ""[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement; my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford.""

He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts, first acting while an active student at the school. He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighborhood. Due to the economic status associated with the neighborhood, Drake described the school as ""not by any means the easiest school to go to."" Drake was often bullied in school for his racial and religious background, and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career, Drake dropped out of school. He later graduated in October 2012.

Career - 2001–2005: Degrassi: The Next Generation
At 15, eager to begin as an actor, a high school friend introduced Drake to his father, who was an acting agent. The agent found Drake a role on Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks a basketball star who became physically disabled after a classmate shot him. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, ""My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV"". He would continue to appear on the show until 2007, returning for sporadic appearances until his character graduated from school. Overall, Drake appeared in a total of 145 episodes.

2006–2009: Early mixtapes and So Far Gone
Lil Wayne, the founder of Young Money Entertainment, would sign Drake to the label in 2009.
After becoming musically inspired by Jay Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco, and included vast production from Canadian producers Boi-1da, and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake described the project as ""pretty straightforward, radio friendly, [and] not much content to it."" The mixtape was released for sale only, and confirmed to have sold over 6,000 copies. In 2007, he released his second mixtape, Comeback Season. Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single ""Replacement Girl"", featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake become the first ever-unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET, with ""Replacement Girl"" being featured on the channel's ""New Joint of the Day"" segment on April 30, 2007. The song also saw Drake sample ""Man of the Year"" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half. This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted the rapper to invite Drake to Houston in order to join his Tha Carter III tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne recorded multiple songs together, including ""Ransom"", ""Forever"", and a remix to ""Brand New"". Despite the collaborations between the duo, Drake was yet to be signed by Young Money Entertainment.

In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website, and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success due to the singles ""Best I Ever Had"" and ""Successful"", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from the original, as well as the additions of the songs ""I'm Goin' In"" and ""Fear"". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.

Due to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a bidding war from various labels, often reported as ""one of the biggest bidding wars ever"". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an unauthorized album titled The Girls Love Drake, which was released on iTunes under dubious means.

Drake then joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of ""Best I Ever Had"" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage, and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He underwent surgery later that year.

2010–2012: Thank Me Later and Take Care
Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed back three weeks, for a June 15, 2010, release.

On March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single ""Over"", which peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second single, ""Find Your Love"", became an even bigger success; peaking at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[76] The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, ""]Care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in [showcasing] images of our destination and people. Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image]."" The third single and fourth singles, ""Miss Me"" and ""Fancy"" respectively, attained moderate commercial success, however, the latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy Awards, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later during a show in Kansas City, Missouri.

Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert, hosted by Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by police after a near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.

It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but scheduling conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented Drake from accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs. It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire on May 8, and he had also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.

Beginning his second effort in fall 2010, Drake announced his intentions to allow for Noah ""40"" Shebib to handle most of the production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me Later, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and others. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next studio album will be Take Care. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed album, stating, ""I didn't get to take the time that I wanted to on that record. I rushed many of the songs and sonically I didn't get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.' Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round."" Drake sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.

In January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the movie, to focus on the album. ""Dreams Money Can Buy"" and ""Marvins Room"" were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20 and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final track listing, while ""Marvins Room"" gained Gold certification by the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio. Drake would soon release the song's music video on June 28.

""Headlines"" was released on August 9, acting as the lead single for Take Care. It was met with positive critical and commercial response, reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his tenth single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs, making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the chart, with 12. It was eventually certified Platinum in both the United States and Canada. The music video for the single was released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game in January 2012. ""Make Me Proud"" was released as the album's second single, on October 16. It was the final single to be released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number nine the following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88. ""Make Me Proud"" soon became Drake's fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum certification by the RIAA.

Prior to the album's release, Drake had planned to record a collaborative album with Lil Wayne, however, it was ultimately scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne. He had also begun collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled Y.O.L.O., but the duo decided against the project, in favor of increased concern for their respective studio albums.

Take Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. John McDonnell of NME dubbed it ""an affecting masterpiece"" and commended its ""delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive lyrics."" Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal found Drake's ""technical abilities"" to be improved and stated, ""Just as his thematic concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them up."" Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice called it ""a carefully crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as anyone not named Kanye West."" Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot complimented the depth of Drake's ""moral psychodramas"" and stated, ""the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with staying power."" It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial success, eventually being certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the US.

The album's third and fourth singles, ""The Motto"" and Take Care"", were released on November 29, and February 21, 2012 respectively. Each song was subject to commercial success, while also having large societal impacts, with ""The Motto"" credited for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States. The music video for ""Take Care"" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating, ""None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye [West] - make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away with it."" The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Video of the Year. The song was also featured on the channel's ""Pop Songs You Must Hear"" list of 2011. ""HYFR"" was the final single to be released from the album, and became certified Gold. It would later win the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video in 2012, and the channel also ranked him at number two on their ""Hottest MCs in the Game"" list.

In promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip-hop tour of 2012, grossing over $42 million. He then returned to acting, starring in Ice Age: Continental Drift as Ethan.

2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and commercial mixtapes
During the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to include and expand the British producer's influence over his next album. Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and despondent lyrics prevalent previously.

In January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first single off of his third album at the conclusion of the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of his third album. The album's second single, ""Hold On, We're Going Home"", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful single off of the album, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song's music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for the video. Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, performing the album's third single, ""Too Much"", alongside featured artist Sampha.

Nothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also enjoyed generally favorable reviews by contemporary music critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in 808s & Heartbreak. The album was also reported to have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was further promoted by the ""Would You like a Tour?"" throughout late 2013, to early 2014. It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the year, grossing an estimated $46 million. Drake then returned to acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night Live, as well as serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what ""kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters"". Drake also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to perform in the city. In late 2014, Drake announced that he had begun recording sessions for his fourth studio album.

In 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the Romeo Santos song Odio. He also appeared on a remix of Tuesday by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard's Rhythmic chart and number twelve on the ""Hot 100"", and released ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"" as a non-album single. The latter went double platinum in the United States.

On February 12, 2015, Drake released If You're Reading This It's Too Late onto iTunes, with no prior announcement. Despite debate on whether it is an album or a mixtape, its commercial stance quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money Records, a scheme that was rumored to allow Drake to leave the label. However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and If You're Reading This It's Too Late sold over 1 million units in 2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in 2015, as well as his fourth overall. Drake proceeded If You're Reading This It's Too Late with a collaborative mixtape with Future, which was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week.

What a Time to Be Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Drake the first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the same year since 2004. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million units. Drake also appeared on the cover of The Fader for their 100th issue.

2016–2017: Views and More Life
Drake announced in January 2016 that his fourth studio album would be launched during the spring, releasing the promotional single ""Summer Sixteen"" later that month. The album was originally titled Views from the six, but would later be shortened to Views. ""Summer Sixteen"" debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his standing in hip-hop to more tenured artists. This move divided many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as ""goodly brash"" or ""conventionally disrespectful."" It was also interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at Drake popularizing the term ""The Six"" when referencing Toronto. Drake also crashed a Bat Mitzvah in New York City on February 20, performing at the event.

Drake soon released the album's lead singles, ""Pop Style"" and the dancehall-infused ""One Dance"", on April 5. Both debuted within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, however, the latter proved more commercially successful, with ""One Dance"" becoming Drake's first number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist. The single also became Drake's first number one single as a lead artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed the album's release date of April 29, and followed it up with various promotional videos. On October 15, ""One Dance"" became Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays as of October 2016.

Views was previewed in London, before its premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being made available to various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later to release a short film titled Please Forgive Me, starring frequent collaborators, Swedish twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta. As of 2019, Views remains Drake's best-selling album.

Drake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as the show's musical guest. Later, Drake was named as a member of the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury. During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had begun working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the music video for ""Child's Play"" was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics. On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views. At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Drake received the most nominations, with 10, winning the awards for Album of the Year and Best Hip-Hop Video. Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the course of the tour in Europe. Seven additional dates were added a day later due to overwhelming demands.

Soon after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed he would be releasing a project titled More Life in December, however he later pushed the date back to the new year. The project was described as a ""playlist of original music"", rather than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album. He was later revealed to be Spotify's most streamed artist for the second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion streams for all projects on the service, which is more than double the amount of streams he had in 2015. Drake later secured his second and third Grammy Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony. Despite multiple setbacks, Drake announced More Life would be released on March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials released through Instagram. Upon release, More Life received mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200, earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It also set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever streamed album in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music alone. The album also garnered 61.3 million streams on Spotify, dethroning Ed Sheeran's ÷ as the highest opening on the service in a single day. He later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins in a single show. Billboard also reported Drake had been present on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has the most recorded entries by a solo artist.

He then released the single ""Signs"" on June 24, as well as reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset. The singles marked his first releases since More Life, with ""Signs"" was initially released as a collaboration between Drake and French fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the ""Louis Vuitton Men’s Spring-Summer 2018"" fashion show. The event also had a playlist exclusively from OVO Sound, curated by label co-founder Oliver El-Khatib. Drake later hosted the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of Virginia Black. Drake then appeared in The Carter Effect documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince Carter, who was the first superstar player to appear for the Toronto Raptors since the franchise's inception in 1995. The documentary also featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and LeBron James.

2018: Scorpion and return to television
After rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer Pi'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017. Two songs would later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on January 20, 2018, marking Drake's first solo release since More Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring on a remix of the Jay-Z song ""Family Feud"" with Lil Wayne, as the lead single of the latter's Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape. Scary Hours featured the songs ""Diplomatic Immunity"" and ""God's Plan"", which both debuted within the top-ten, with the latter eventually breaking various streaming records as it debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was Drake's second as a solo artist to reach number one.

Drake earned his 70th top 40 hit after featuring on the Migos song ""Walk It Talk It"", which debuted at number eighteen, and peaked at number ten. He later featured on BlocBoy JB's debut single, ""Look Alive"", which was released on February 9, 2018. The song's entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper with the top 10 hits on the Hot 100, with 23. He then featured on a remix to ""Lemon"", a song originally released as collaboration between band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, Drake announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was releasing a single later that night. On April 6, ""Nice for What"" was released, alongside a music video, which featured several female celebrities.

After ""Nice For What"" replaced his own ""God's Plan"" on the Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to have a new number-one debut replace their former number-one debut, Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion, with a planned release date of June 29, 2018. He then released ""I'm Upset"" on May 26, as the album's third single. Scorpion was then released as a double-album, and marked Drake's longest project, with a run-time of just under 90 minutes. The album broke both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it gained 132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming service, respectively. It eventually sold 749,000 album equivalent units in its first week of sales, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.

Shortly thereafter, Drake collaborated with British hip hop promotion Link Up TV on July 7, releasing a freestyle as a part of the promotion's 'Behind Barz' segment, before releasing another freestyle a week later after featuring on Charlie Sloth's long-running Fire in the Booth program on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Drake then earned his sixth number-one hit with ""In My Feelings"" on July 21, which also spawned the viral ""#InMyFeelingsChallenge"" or ""#KiKiChallenge"". The success of ""In My Feelings"" also made Drake the record holder for most number one hits among rappers. Soon after, he released the music video for ""Nonstop"", which was filmed in London during his surprise performance at the Wireless Festival.

He then appeared on the album Astroworld, featuring uncredited vocals for the song ""Sicko Mode"", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Drake announced in July 2018 that he planned to ""take 6 months to a year"" to himself in order to produce television and films, including Euphoria. He then began the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour with co-headliners Migos on August 12. This preceded collaboration with Bad Bunny titled ""Mia"", which featured Drake performing in Spanish. He later received the award for Hot Ticket Performer at the 2018 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 16. During a performance in Edmonton on November 7, Drake announced his intention to begin composing his next project in early 2019.

2019–present: Upcoming album
In February 2019, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rap Song, for ""God's Plan"", at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. During his speech, producers abruptly cut to a commercial break, leading viewers to speculate they were censoring his speech during which he criticized The Recording Academy. A legal representative for the Academy then released a statement stating ""a natural pause [led] the producers [to] assume that he was done and cut to commercial,"" and added the organization offered him an opportunity to return to stage, but he declined.

On February 14, Drake re-released his third mixtape, So Far Gone, onto streaming services for the first time to commemorate its 10-year anniversary, and later collaborated with Summer Walker on a remix of Walker's song ""Girls Need Love"", marking his first release of 2019. On April 10, 2019 during a London performance on his Assassination Vacation Tour, the OVO leader told the crowd he was working on his new album before the show. On June 8, Drake appeared on Chris Brown's single ""No Guidance"". On June 15, Drake released two songs, ""Omertà"" and ""Money in the Grave"", on his EP The Best in the World Pack to celebrate the NBA Championship win of the Toronto Raptors. On August 2, he released the compilation album Care Package, consisting of songs released between 2010 and 2016 that were initially unavailable for purchase or commercial streaming; it debuted at number one.

Artistry - influences
Drake has cited several hip hop artists as influencing his rapping style, including Kanye West, Jay Z, and Lil Wayne, while also attributing various R&B artists as influential to the incorporation of the genre into his own music, including Aaliyah, and Usher. Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his ""biggest inspirations"".

Musical style
Drake has credited Kanye West (left) and Aaliyah (right) as being his biggest musical influences. Drake is known for his egotistical lyrics, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory when dealing with relationships with women. His vocal abilities have been lauded for an audible contrast between typical hip-hop beats and melody, with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents, delivered on technical lyricism. His songs often include audible changes in lyrical pronunciation in parallel with his upbringing in Toronto, and connections with Caribbean and Middle Eastern countries which include such phrases as ""ting"", ""touching road"", ""talkin' boasy"" and ""gwanin' wassy"". Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip-hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing. He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by Lil Wayne, and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.

The lyrical content that Drake deploys is typically considered to be emotional or boastful. However, Drake is often revered for incorporating ""degrading"" themes of money, drug use, and women into newer, idealized contexts, often achieving this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between ""pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata."" Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as ""hyper-reality rap"", which is characterized by its focus on themes of celebrity as being distinct from the ""real world.""

Public image
The Washington Post editor Maura Judkis credits Drake for popularizing the phrase ""YOLO"" in the United States, with his single, ""The Motto"", which includes, ""You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO."" Drake later popularized the term ""The Six"" in 2015 in relation his hometown Toronto, subsequently becoming a point of reference to the city. Furthermore, the subject matter of his artistry often revolving around relationships, have had widespread impact on social media through photo captions commonly used to reference emotions or personal situations. However, his lyrical contents have had a negative reception from fans and critics deeming him as sensitive; a trait that is understood as being antithetical to hip hop culture. June 10 was declared ""Drake Day"" in Houston, Texas. In 2016, Drake visited Drake University after a show in Des Moines, in response to an extensive social media campaign by students that began in 2009, advocating for his appearance. In 2016, Drake spoke on the shooting of Alton Sterling, publishing an open letter expressing his concern for the safety of ethnic minorities against police brutality in the United States. He would also donate $200,000 in order to aid relief efforts in Houston as a result of Hurricane Harvey. In February 2018, following the single ""God's Plan"" debut at no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Drake donated $50,000 to a Miami homeless shelter and giving a University of Miami student $50,000 to help with her tuition. Drake then ""kept up the spending spree"" by donating the rest of the song's video budget, $996,631.90, to several charitable causes and regular people across Miami.

The music video for ""Hotline Bling"" went viral, due to Drake's eccentric choices in dancing. The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake's unconventional nature on the song, causing it to gain popularity on YouTube, spawning several parodies. Drake has also been critiqued for his expensive, product placement-heavy attire, exampled by the video for ""Hotline Bling"". Drake modelled a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and limited edition Timberland 6"" Classic Boots. This foresaw collaborations between OVO and Canada Goose, in which various items of clothing were produced. Drake had also released his own collection of Air Jordans, dubbed the ""Air Jordan OVOs"". Moreover, his style and dress sense have caused GQ magazine to describe him as ""[one of] the most stylish men alive"".

Controversies - legal issues
In 2012, singer Ericka Lee filed a lawsuit against Drake for the usage of her voice on ""Marvins Room"". Claiming to have provided the female vocals, Lee also alleged she was owed songwriting credits and royalties. Despite Drake's legal team countering by claiming that Lee simply requested a credit in the liner notes of the album, the matter was resolved in February 2013, with both parties agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. In 2014, Drake was sued for $300,000 for sampling ""Jimmy Smith Rap"", a 1982 single by jazz musician, Jimmy Smith. The suit was filed by Smith's estate, who stated Drake never asked for permission when sampling it for the intro on ""Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2"", claiming Smith himself would have disagreed as he disliked hip hop. Drake would win the lawsuit in 2017, with federal judge William Pauley ruling the content used was transformative, and there was no liability for copyright infringement. Also in 2014, it emerged that Drake was sued by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay, claiming Drake misused his lyrics on when collaborating with YG on the song ""Who Do You Love?"". He sought $100,000 for mistreatment and artistic theft, which Drake paid to the rapper later that year. In 2016, Drake caused a nightclub in Oklahoma City to close down, due to his usage of marijuana and other illegal drugs being prevalent at the club.

In 2017, Drake was embroiled in another lawsuit, being sued by producer Detail (Noel Fisher) over an alleged assault in 2014. Fisher claimed Drake's bodyguard, Nessel ""Chubbs"" Beezer, punched him in the face and allegedly broke his jaw over musical and financial disputes. Fisher also says the injuries caused him to be hospitalized for days and had to undergo several surgeries, following which he sued for damages related to medical bills and physical and emotional suffering. The case, which was set to undergo trial in May 2018, was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Elaine Lu, after Fisher failed to show up for a final status conference; the judge ruled that Beezer solely acted in self-defense.

Feuds
Drake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. Chris Brown tweeted about the incident and released a song criticizing Drake weeks later. Despite no response from Drake, he and Brown both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing, virtually ending the dispute.

In December 2014, Drake was involved in another altercation, being punched by Diddy outside the LIV nightclub in Miami, Florida. The altercation was reported to be over Drake's usage of the instrumental for ""0 to 100 / The Catch Up"", allegedly produced by Boi-1da for Diddy, before Drake appropriated the track for his own use. Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an old arm injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe magazine. Drake would later respond on ""6 God"" and ""6PM in New York"", which has been interpreted as directly involved in Tyga's abrupt removal from Young Money Entertainment.

Further controversy arose in July 2015, when it was alleged by Meek Mill that Drake had used ghostwriters during recording sessions for ""RICO"", one of the lead singles off of Mill's second studio album. This proceeded further allegations that Drake did not help in promotion of the album, due to Mill discovering the ghostwriter, widely believed to be Quentin Miller. Despite Miller collaborating with Drake and receiving past credits, Mill assured that Miller had written Drake's verse for ""R.I.C.O."". Soon after, Funkmaster Flex aired reference tracks in support of Mill's claims, notably for ""R.I.C.O."", ""10 Bands"", and ""Know Yourself"". This prompted Drake to respond with two diss tracks, titled ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back"", in the space of four days. Mill would later respond with ""Wanna Know"", before removing it from SoundCloud weeks later. Despite subliminal disses from either artist, the feud has not been officially reignited. Drake would further seek to denounce Funkmaster Flex during his Madison Square Garden shows on the Summer Sixteen Tour. Following Meek Mill's sentencing of two to four years for probation violation, Drake stated ""Free Meek Mill"" at a concert in Australia, and ended their rivalry on ""Family Feud"". Pusha T would also use the same rationale to criticize Drake on ""Infrared"" in 2018, prompting Drake to respond with the ""Duppy Freestyle"" diss track on May 25. Pusha T would directly respond to the track through ""The Story of Adidon"" on May 29, which presented several claims, including an accusation of Drake fathering a secret child. The pair is considered to have been in a rivalry since 2012, with Drake yet to respond to ""The Story of Adidon"".

In 2016, Drake was embroiled in a feud with Joe Budden, stemming from Budden's derogatory comments when reviewing Views. Drake would allegedly respond to Budden through ""4PM in Calabasas"", prompting Budden to respond with two diss tracks in the space of five days, echoing the same sentiment Drake deployed during his feud with Meek Mill. Drake would later appear on ""No Shopping"" alongside French Montana, directly referencing Budden throughout the song. However, French Montana claimed that Drake's verse was recorded before the release of Budden's diss tracks. Despite Budden releasing two further songs in reference to Drake, he has yet to officially respond to Budden. In the same year, Drake mocked Kid Cudi for his mental health, drug use and suicidal urges on ""Two Birds, One Stone"" after Cudi launched an expletive-filled rant on the artist on Twitter. Cudi later checked into a rehabilitation facility following the release of the song, and continued to disparage Drake in further tweets.

In mid-2018, Drake was embroiled in a feud with long-time collaborator, Kanye West. In an appearance on the talk show The Shop in October, Drake recounted several business meetings with West, who voiced his desire to ""be Quincy Jones"" and work with him, in order to replicate the producer-artist relationship between Jones and Michael Jackson. West requested Drake play and inform him of upcoming releases, which was agreed to as Drake ""felt a genuine vibe"" from West, and after West gifted him the beat to ""Lift Yourself"", which inspired Drake to begin writing to the instrumental. West then requested Drake to travel to Wyoming to continue working, and arrived a day after close friend 40. 40 said West was working on an album; contradictory to his previous aim of just wanting to ""give [Drake] beats"". Drake responded by saying West stated he would release in late 2018, and they should continue on. However, upon his arrival in Wyoming, Drake ""[spent] the majority of time working on [West's] music"", only exploring his own after playing the producer the song ""March 14"", which addresses Drake's relationship with his newborn son and co-parent. This prompted a conversation with West regarding his personal issues, after which, news of his son would be exposed by Pusha T. West would also release ""Lift Yourself"", and produce ""Infrared""; actions that greatly displeased Drake. This prompted him to denounce West in several songs and live performances. West would retaliate in a series of tweets in late 2018.

Drake has purported to have been in reported feuds with DMX, Kendrick Lamar, Common, The Weeknd, XXXTentacion, Jay-Z, Tory Lanez, and Ludacris, although the latter three have been reported to be resolved.

Business ventures - Endorsements
Prior to venturing into business, Drake garnered several endorsement deals with various companies, notably gaining one with Sprite following his mention of drinking purple drank, a concoction that contains Sprite as a key ingredient. In the aftermath of his highly publicized feud with Meek Mill, Drake was also endorsed by fast food restaurants Burger King and Whataburger. Business magazine Forbes commented his endorsement deals and business partnerships ""combined heavily"" for Drake's reported pre-tax earnings at $94 million between June 2016 to June 2017, being one of the highest-paid celebrities during that period.

Main article: OVO Sound
During the composition of Nothing Was the Same, Drake started his own record label in late 2012 with producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, and business partner, Oliver El-Khatib. Drake sought for an avenue to release his own music, as well helping in the nurturing of other artists, while Shebib and El-Khatib yearned to start a label with a distinct sound, prompting the trio to team up to form OVO Sound. The name is an abbreviation derived from the October's Very Own moniker Drake used to publish his earlier projects. Warner Bros. Records currently distribute the label.

Drake, 40 and PartyNextDoor were the label's inaugural artists. The label houses artists including Drake, PartyNextDoor, Majid Jordan, OB O'Brien, Roy Woods, dvsn, Plaza, and Kash Doll, as well as producers including 40, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Mike Zombie, Nineteen85, and Future the Prince. OVO Sound has released six albums, with two certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Toronto Raptors
On September 30, 2013, at a press conference with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke, Drake was announced as the new ""global ambassador"" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of the NBA franchise, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. This would also be the setting where Drake was given The Key to the City. In the role, it was announced that Drake would help to promote and serve as a host of festivities, beginning with the All-Star Game. He would also provide consulting services to rebrand the team, helping to redesign its image and clothing line in commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary. He began by hosting an annual ""Drake Night"" segment with the organization, which began in 2013.

Apple Music
Following the launch of Apple Music, a music and video streaming service developed by Apple Inc., the company announced Drake as the figurehead for the platform at their Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015, with the artist also penning an exclusivity deal with the service worth a reported $19 million. This saw all future solo releases by Drake becoming available first on Apple Music, before seeing roll out to other streaming services and music retailers. Drake had also developed the OVO Sound Radio station on Beats 1, which is utilized as the primary avenue for debuting singles and projects, with the station overseeing over 300 million unique users when it debuted More Life. Drake's partnership with Apple Music has largely been credited for the platform's sharp success, as it attained 10 million subscribers after six months, as well as giving birth to exclusivity from artists, with many independent and signed artists, such as Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, also brokering exclusivity deals with streaming services. Through signing with the company, Drake was one of the artists, alongside Pharrell and Katy Perry, to exclusively own an Apple Watch before the smartwatch saw public release.

Virginia Black
Two months prior to the release of Views, Drake announced the development of Virginia Black, a bourbon-based whiskey. This would be his second foray into selling foodstuffs, previously partnering with celebrity chef Susur Lee to open Fring's Restaurant in Toronto. The beverage was created and also distributed alongside Proximo Spirits, as well as with Brent Hocking, a spirits producer who founded DeLeón Tequila in 2008. The company described the partnership as ""fruitful [as they] share a passion for style, music, and the pursuit of taste [on] a quest to redefine whiskey.""

The product was launched in June 2016, and contained two, three and four-year old Bourbon whiskies. The company sold over 4,000 bottles in the first week domestically. The brand was also promoted and marketed through Drake's music and various tours, such as being part of the ""Virginia Black VIP Lounge"" additional package available for purchase during the Summer Sixteen Tour. Virginia Black shipped a further 30,000 units when rollout was extended to select international markets in late 2016. The company later aired commercials with Dennis Graham, which featured the tagline of ""The Realest Dude Ever"" (in reference toward ""The Most Interesting Man in the World"" tagline employed by Dos Equis) after extending the sale of the drink to various European countries in 2017.

Personal life
Drake lives in Hidden Hills, California, since 2012. He also owns a property in Toronto, which was built from the ground-up in 2017, and a Toronto condo adjacent to the CN Tower. He owns a Boeing 767 airplane.

Drake's paternal uncles are bass guitarist Larry Graham and musician Teenie Hodges. Graham achieved both critical and commercial success as a member of the band Sly and the Family Stone, while Hodges featured as the lead guitarist and songwriter for Al Green, and contributed heavily on much of his work in the 1970s, including the hits ""Take Me to the River"", ""Love and Happiness"", and ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)"".

Drake is a father to one son named Adonis, who was born on October 11, 2017, to French artist Sophie Brussaux. Brussaux's pregnancy was the subject of several rumors after featuring in a TMZ article in early 2017; Drake eventually confirmed his fatherhood on the album Scorpion in 2018.

Drake dated singer Rihanna off-and-on from 2009 to 2016. He has mentioned the relationship in every one of his studio albums, and when presenting Rihanna with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 2016, he said ""she's a woman I've been in love with since I was 22 years old."" On becoming a single parent, he mused on the talk show The Shop:

As life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don't have the fairy tale, like, 'Oh, Drake started a family with Rihanna and this is like so perfect.' It looks so good on paper. By the way, I wanted that too at one time.

10) Alias of guitarist Jussi Kousa
11) Member of Impure Ziggurat

1)  RM real name is Kim Namjoon (Korean: 김남준; born September 12, 1994), better known as RM, is a South Korean rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is the leader and the main rapper in the South Korean boy group BTS, managed under Big Hit Labels.

**RM of BTS - Active during his pre-debut days as an underground rapper (Runch Randa). 13-year-old Nam-joon was already a prodigy in rap, he'd often attended gigs in his hometown Ilcheon and earned a place for himself in the underground scene at an early age, impressing even older underground rappers. He had made a collab with the famous rapper Zico back in 2008, the track can be found on many platforms including YouTube and SoundCloud.

In early 2015, RM earned not only the approval from big names in the Korean Hip-hop scene, but he had also gained respect from the American Hip-hop figure Warren G. The two came together for the track ""P.D.D"", where RM asks his haters to stay alive to witness his success. The west coast rapper stated in an interview with CJ America, ""I couldn’t understand all his lyrics, but I can say that it was very good because his flow, style, and rhythm are all excellent.” He then even went on to say, ""When I hear Rap Monster’s songs, it sounds like Snoop Dogg or me rapping with the beats we’ve made.” 

 On March 4, 2015, RM released a single with Warren G entitled, ""P.D.D (Please Don't Die)"" ahead of his first solo mixtape RM following an offer by Warren G to collaborate. The track reflected how RM felt towards those who hated and criticized him at the time, which he used to find very upsetting.

It's a work where Namjoon discusses hip-hop's influence in his life, the hardships he'd experienced in pursuit of his career, as well as his struggle with self-love and self-acceptance.

The two conversed through lyrics, claiming that people were controlled by the higher power and voiced out their wish of a changing world.

In 2018, he came out with a second mixtape named ""mono"". A project containing a few collaborations (with artists such as HONNE, NELL, eAeon) where Nam-joon experimented with lofi Hip-Hop and ballad. Though different from his previous works, he was still able to showcase his soul-deep lyricism, where he often implemented his skill of using wordplay and metaphors to further reach his listeners. With this mixtape, he continued to explore his own identity and life through a microscope, touching topics like loneliness, self-doubt, longing, and even explored the concept of love and hate. 'mono' proved RM a unique artist of diversity and growth. The mixtape is available on Spotify, iTunes, and SoundCloud. During its first day of release, the mixtape reached high positions on stream platforms, giving RM a profile with verification, resulting in his becoming of a more acknowledged rapper, producer, and songwriter.

In December, RM collaborated on a remix of Fall Out Boy's song ""Champion"". The track reached number 18 on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles and helped RM reach number 46 on the Emerging Artists Chart for the week of January 8, 2018.

In November, RM also collaborated with Tiger JK on his last and final album under the stage name Drunken Tiger, featuring on the track ""Timeless"". Tiger JK originally expected RM's lyrics to contain self-praise, which was the trend of rap at the time; RM instead wrote lyrics about leaving behind the historical meaning of Drunken Tiger's name.

A lot of prestigious artists, from South Korea and EUA, found interest in RM and invited him for collaborations. Famous American rappers like Wale and Lil Nas X, even the rock group Fall Out Boy and famous Korean artists like Drunken Tiger and Gaeko.

28,kendrick lamar,4292683,764328399,"Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper. Regarded as one of the most influential hip-hop artists of his generation, and one of the greatest rappers of all time, he was awarded the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music, becoming the first musician outside of the classical and jazz genres to receive the honor.

Born in Compton, California, Lamar began releasing music under the stage name K.Dot while attending high school. He signed with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) in 2005, and co-founded the hip hop supergroup Black Hippy there. Following the 2011 release of his alternative rap debut album Section.80, Lamar secured a joint contract with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. He rose to fame with his gangsta rap-influenced second album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012), which became the longest-charting hip hop studio album in Billboard 200's chart history. In 2015, Lamar scored his first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, after featuring on the remix of Taylor Swift's ""Bad Blood"", and released his third album, To Pimp a Butterfly, which infused hip-hop with historical African-American music genres such as jazz, funk, and soul, and became his first of five consecutive number-one albums on the Billboard 200 chart.

Lamar's critical and commercial success continued with his R&B and pop-leaning fourth album Damn (2017), yielding his second US number-one single, ""Humble"". He curated original songs for the soundtrack of the 2018 film Black Panther, earning a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the US top-ten single ""All the Stars"". Lamar's 2022 double album Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers concluded his tenure with TDE and Aftermath. His feud with Drake and subsequent sixth album GNX (2024) spawned the Hot 100 number-ones ""Like That"" and ""Squabble Up"", as well as ""Not Like Us"", which became the most-awarded song in the Grammy Awards history, with five wins, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year.

Lamar has received various accolades, including 22 Grammy Awards (the third-most won by a rapper), a Primetime Emmy Award, a Brit Award, 4 American Music Awards, 7 Billboard Music Awards, 11 MTV Video Music Awards (including 2 Video of the Year wins), and a record 37 BET Hip Hop Awards. Time listed him as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016. Three of his works were included in Rolling Stone's 2020 revision of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Outside of music, Lamar co-founded the creative company PGLang and ventured into film with his longtime creative partner, Dave Free. 

Kendrick Lamar Duckworth was born on June 17, 1987, in Compton, California. He is the first child of former gang hustler Kenneth ""Kenny"" Duckworth and hairdresser Paula Oliver. Both of his parents are African Americans from the South Side of Chicago. When they were teenagers, they relocated to Compton in 1984, due to his father's affiliation with the Gangster Disciples. Lamar was named after singer-songwriter Eddie Kendricks of the Temptations. He was an only child until the age of seven and was described as a loner by his mother. Eventually, his parents had his two younger brothers and younger sister, businesswoman Kayla Sawyer (née Duckworth). His cousins include basketball player Nick Young and rapper Baby Keem. He considered studying psychology and astronomy in college, but suspended his academic pursuits to focus on his music career.

Tupac Shakur is Lamar's biggest influence, having impacted both his professional and personal lives. One of his earliest childhood memories is watching him and Dr. Dre film the second music video for their single ""California Love"" with his father at the Compton Swap Meet. Lamar has described himself as an ""offspring"" of Shakur's artistry and sociopolitical views. Although some publications have regarded him as the Shakur of his generation, he has strived to maintain his individuality.

Lamar maintains a low public profile, and is known to be reserved. He is reluctant to publicly discuss his personal life and generally avoids using social media. He is also decisive when engaging with mainstream media outlets, although journalists have complimented his ""Zen-like"" calmness and down to earth personality. According to Lamar, he has become ""so invested in who I am outside of being famous, sometimes that's all I know. I've always been a person that really didn't dive too headfirst into wanting and needing attention. I mean, we all love attention, but for me, I don't necessarily adore it."" His lyrics have been a topic of media scrutiny, leading to both praise and controversy.

Lamar's public perception has also been influenced by the various rap feuds he has been involved with. Although some journalists declared him the winner of his highly publicized conflict with Drake, some felt that his victory was pyrrhic due to the severity of accusations introduced and the spread of online misinformation. Following the release of Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, media outlets have described Lamar as the ""modern hip hop messiah"". Some critics dislike his ""grating"" political infusions, causing him to be viewed as having a savior complex. However, Lamar has declared himself to be the ""greatest rapper alive"" due to his personal connection to hip hop. ""I'm not doing it to have a good song, or one good rap, or a good hook, or a good bridge,"" he explained to Zane Lowe. ""I want to keep doing it every time, period. And to do it every time, you have to challenge yourself and you have to confirm to yourself—not anybody else, confirm to yourself that you're the best, period. [...] That's my drive and that's my hunger, I will always have"".

In November 2024, Kendrick Lamar released his sixth studio album, GNX, marking his first project after departing from Top Dawg Entertainment and Aftermath Entertainment. The album features collaborations with artists such as SZA, Roddy Ricch, and emerging Los Angeles rappers, and includes production contributions from Jack Antonoff. GNX blends elements reminiscent of his previous works, combining mainstream appeal with complex themes, and introduces new influences like the West Coast club sound. The album's release intensified Lamar's ongoing feud with Drake, particularly with the track ""Not Like Us,"" which became a massive hit and won multiple Grammy awards. Following his performance at the Super Bowl Halftime Show in 2025, GNX returned to the top of the Billboard 200 chart, solidifying Lamar's status as a dominant force in contemporary hip-hop. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

31,mac miller,2960443,327584611,"Malcolm McCormick, also known by his stage name Mac Miller, was an American rapper, singer-songwriter and record producer from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was also a noted record producer under the pseudonym Larry Fisherman. Raised Jewish and teaching himself music from a young age, McCormick defied the stereotypes of hip-hop and released his first mixtape under the name EZ Mac, titled ""But My Mackin' Ain't Easy"" in 2007, when McCormick was only fifteen. He released many more in his lifetime, including ""K.I.D.S."" in 2010, which earned Mac widespread attention in the hip-hop scene, and ""Best Day Ever"" in 2011, which featured the hit single ""Donald Trump"". 

He was signed to Pittsburgh-based Rostrum Records and released his debut album Blue Slide Park on November 8, 2011, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 despite being released completely independently. He released five studio albums in his lifetime, which all peaked in the top 5, along with a posthumous album titled ""Circles"" with help from producer Jon Brion and Miller's family.

In 2013, Miller released his second studio album, ""Watching Movies With the Sound Off"". The album featured artists such as Earl Sweatshirt, Tyler, The Creator, Ab-Soul, and long-time friend ScHoolboy Q. The album took a more personal approach compared to his previous works.

In 2014, Miller released the 24-track mixtape ""Faces"". Considered by many to be one of his best works, he explores themes of drug use, employing and featuring collaborators of Mac from his previous album, including ScHoolboy Q and Earl Sweatshirt, but also sees new faces such as Rick Ross. 

In 2015, Mac released his third studio album, ""GO:OD AM"", his first with new label Warner Records. The album featured a more energetic and vibrant theme than ""Faces"" and ""Watching Movies With the Sound Off"", reflecting a more optimistic,  redemptive angle on his personal life, while maintaining elements of his introspective and thought-provoking style from earlier works.

In 2016, Miller released his fourth studio album, titled ""The Divine Feminine"". He explores themes of love and femininity, largely influenced by his relationship with Ariana Grande at the time and featuring appearances from the likes of Kendrick Lamar and Anderson Paak. 

In August 2018, following major events in Miller's life, including his breakup with Ariana Grande, with Miller's drug addiction alleged to be a contributing factor, as well as a car crash incident in which McCormick was charged with a DUI, Miller released his fifth and final studio album during his lifetime titled ""Swimming"". Continuing the dive into his personal life, Miller explores his heartfelt struggles and grief in the past, but remains optimistic for the future. Swimming was nominated for Best Rap Album posthumously at the 2019 Grammy Awards.

Miller had struggled with substance abuse for a long time before his death. On September 7, 2018, he was found dead in his home in Los Angeles, California from an accidental overdose of fentanyl, cocaine, and alcohol, only a little over a month after the release of ""Swimming"".  He was only 26 years old. McCormick was buried in his hometown of Pittsburgh. Miller's passing was largely unexpected and had a large impact on the hip-hop community as a whole, with many paying their respects to Miller.  On October 31, 2018, a tribute concert, titled ""Mac Miller: A Celebration of Life"", featured renowned artists and many longtime collaborators of Miller including Travis Scott, ScHoolboy Q, SZA, Chance the Rapper, and Earl Sweatshirt. The concert was a celebration of the late rapper's life and musical achievements, and all profits were donated to the Mac Miller Circles Fund, which provides young people from underprivileged backgrounds with opportunities to explore arts and music.

 In January 2020, Miller's posthumous album titled ""Circles"", worked on in companionship with his album ""Swimming"", was announced on January 8 along with the single ""Good News"" and released later that month. Every track on the album was accompanied by a video of the same name, often with psychedelic imagery and images of Mac before his passing and throughout his life. With a more melancholic theme compared to his previous works, the album was well-received by fans and critics alike, renowned for the care placed in continuing Mac's artistic vision. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Mac+Miller"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

33,house of pain,1112109,8701256,"House of Pain was an Irish-styled American hip-hop group who released three albums in the early to mid 90's before lead rapper Everlast decided to pursue his solo career again. The group is best known for its 1992 hit single Jump Around.

The band's history starts with a failed short solo career, Everlast teamed up with DJ Lethal and high school friend Danny Boy to form House of Pain. The group was signed to Tommy Boy Records, and their self-titled debut album (1992) went multi-platinum, spawning the successful DJ Muggs produced single Jump Around.

Fashioning themselves as rowdy Irish-American hooligans (Lethal is actually of Latvian heritage), they toured with various rap and alternative-rock bands after their breakthrough. They participated together with Helmet, along with several other rap acts, on the influential 1993 rock-rap collaborative Judgement Night movie soundtrack.

Sophomore album and decline in popularity

Their follow-up effort, 1994's Same As It Ever Was, went gold despite minimal airplay and no major hits. The first single, ""On Point,"" is noted for taking a swipe at another American rapper with a strong Irish heritage, Mark Wahlberg (""Calvin Klein's no friend of mine/So I don't like Marky""). Like Cypress Hill, who, with House of Pain, were a part of the loosely-affiliated Soul Assassins posse, they found urban radio airplay an increasingly closed path, which affected album sales.

Third album

House of Pain abruptly broke up in 1996 after the release of their third album, Truth Crushed To Earth Shall Rise Again, which featured guest appearances by rappers Sadat X of Brand Nubian, Guru of Gang Starr, producer/rapper Divine Styler and reggae singjay Cockni O'Dire (credited as the Scheme Team). On the release date of the album, Everlast announced his departure from the group.

Split, solo and current affairs

From this point on, the status of the group would seem to be in the past tense, though the members would continue their careers separately. Danny Boy would found an art company, DJ Lethal became a member of nu metal band Limp Bizkit, and Everlast would finally get multi-platinum solo fame in 1998. In that year his acoustic rock/blues-inflected Whitey Ford Sings the Blues album hit the charts, together with the single ""What It's Like"". In 2000, a feud between Everlast and rapper Eminem coincided with the gold-selling Eat at Whitey's, which had minor hits like ""Black Jesus"" and ""Black Coffee"", and featured a collaboration with Carlos Santana. After the sale of the Tommy Boy Records catalogue of master tapes to Warner Bros. Music, Everlast signed with Island/Def Jam, and released the solo LP White Trash Beautiful in 2004.

Later the same year Rhino Records, a subdivision of Warner Music, has released a hit collection, Shamrocks & Shenanigans, with singles from Everlast's early solo days, the House of Pain and his post-group solo efforts. Prior to the release, Everlast announced on his official message board that he was not endorsing the compilation album.

Founded by Danny Boy in early 2006, La Coka Nostra is a new project that has reunited him, Everlast and DJ Lethal for the first time since House of Pain's split. Other group members include Ill Bill of Non Phixion, and newcomers Slaine and Big Left.

34,black eyed peas,5217457,122362128,"Black Eyed Peas is an American hip hop/pop group formed in Los Angeles in 1995. The group's current line-up consists of will.i.am, Taboo and apl.de.ap. Black Eyed Peas have so-far sold an estimated 56 million albums and singles worldwide.

Black Eyed Peas went to centenary state high school and got their start in 1988 when will.i.am (born 1975 William James Adams Jr.) and apl.de.ap (born 1974 Allan Pineda) began rapping and performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to Ruthless Records (run by Eazy-E) after catching the attention of the nephew of Jerry Heller (Eazy-E's manager). Along with Mookie Mook (Burning Star), Dante Santiago & DJ Motiv8, they called their group A.T.B.A.N. Klann. Their debut album, 'Grass Roots', was not released originally because Ruthless did not consider the social themes reflected in the group's music to be marketable to their audience. A single ""Puddles of H2O"" was released in 1994 but no album was released (until it leaked onto the Internet in the mid 2000s). 

After Eazy-E died of an AIDS related illness in 1995, they changed their name to Black Eyed Peas; will.i.am explained on the front cover of the Monkey Business album that ""Black Eyed Peas are food for the soul"", hence the name. will.i.am has cited the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an influence and said he named his band after a food, like them. They replaced their original third member Mookie, with Dante Santiago the Peas original singer. Then Taboo (born Jaime Gomez) joined the group. Dante Santiago took on a role as a guest vocalist in the band and featured frequently on various tracks for their first four albums. 

In 1996, they produced and appeared on a song entitled ""That's Right"" for Brian Austin Green's hip-hop album One Stop Carnival. Later, they began using Kim Hill as a steady background singer. Unlike many hip-hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a musical and clothing style that differed wildly from the ""gangsta rap"" sounds of other Los Angeles-based hip-hop acts at the time. Through the mid-'90s, they performed in the local club circuit alongside fellow acts such as Ozomatli and Jurassic 5.

The group were signed to Interscope Records and released their debut, ""Behind the Front"", in 1998. The album won the group (and their accompanying live band, the Bucky Jonsons) critical acclaim. The album featured the single ""Joints & Jams"", which was included on the Bulworth soundtrack. Their second album, ""Bridging the Gap"", was released in 2000; it featured the single ""Request + Line"" featuring Macy Gray.

After replacing their female background singer with Fergie, the group released their breakout album, ""Elephunk"", and their 2005 album, ""Monkey Business"", which featured the hit singles ""Pump It"", ""Don't Phunk With My Heart"", ""Don't Lie"" and ""My Humps"".

""The E.N.D. (The Energy Never Dies)"", their fifth album, was released worldwide in June 2009 and has managed to sell 5 million copies in 8 months (Elephunk: 7 million, Monkey Business: 10 million). It already spawned 2 of the most downloaded singles of all time: ""Boom Boom Pow"" and ""I Gotta Feeling"", both were downloaded 5 million times only in the USA. The 3rd single ""Meet Me Halfway"" was downloaded 2 million times and the 4th ""Imma Be"", which was just released, already sold 1 million. ""Rock That Body"" is the 5th single.

He rose to popularity on the online platform TikTok, with a popular series called ""Minute-Long Songs"". Through this series he wrote lots of the songs he's released, including his international hit ""Toxic"". (2021)  He is currently an independent artist, after his deal with Republic Records ended.

Career
2020–2021: Beginnings on TikTok and ""Toxic""
BoyWithUke began uploading to TikTok in 2020 after being introduced to the platform by his brother. At first, his content did not attract much attention on the platform, until 2021, when several of his videos (including Minute-Long Songs) started to perform well.

Serotonin Dreams is supposedly him ""waking up"" and the ""Magnum Opus"" of the saga as overall unlike its antecedent, Serotonin Dreams is focusing on realization and generally more positive values, whilst still having occasional references to the values of its predecessors.

42,jid,1125894,74551018,"Destin Route (b. October 31, 1990), better known by the stage name JID, is an American rapper from Zone 6, Atlanta, Georgia. He describes himself as “a soft-spoken but intricate lyricist with a cocky side.” His stage name originates from “jittery,” his grandmother’s nickname for him due to his sporadic behavior as a child.

He first appeared on the Atlanta hip-hop scene with his debut EP, DiCaprio, in 2015. Growing up, JID's first connection with music was through his parents' collection of classic funk and soul LPs. After a stint at Hampton University playing football, JID also hooked up with fellow MCs as part of the Spillage Village collective. By 2012, he had dropped out of college to focus on music, and in 2014 he headed out on what would be a productive tour with EarthGang, Bas, and Ab-Soul. Touring allowed JID to craft his skills, and a year later he recorded and dropped the DiCaprio EP, which saw him team up with a host of producers, as well as EarthGang. While keen to distance himself from the generic abrasive trap sound that had dominated the Atlanta scene, JID wanted to deliver something that was more than just about a beat, and instead focused his time and effort on lyrics as well. In 2016, JID, alongside the rest of the Spillage Village crew, released the album Bears Like This Too Much, which saw the rapper honing his unique delivery and inspired lyrics. In 2017, he announced that he had signed to J. Cole's Dreamville label (a connection made with the rapper via JID's part in the 2014 tour with Bas and Cole's friend and producer Cedric Brown), which released the single Never and full-length The Never Story at the beginning of the year. In September of 2018, he issued the single ""151 Rum,"" the first offering from DiCaprio 2, his sophomore full-length and sequel to his 2015 EP. Later that year he released the album ""Dicaprio 2"". JID released his most recent album, ""The Forever Story"" on August 26th, 2022, the two singles on the album, ""Surround Sound (feat. 21 Savage & Baby Tate)"" and ""Dance Now"" were released on January 14th 2022, and August 9th 2022 respectively. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Jid"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Austin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York. He was raised by his father, Richard Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip-hop, country, and rock. When Malone was nine years old, he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys. Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game Guitar Hero.

Malone has always had a love for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event. According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band. He says soon afterward he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip-hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.

According to Malone, he chose ""Post Malone"" as his stage name when he was 14 or 15. The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone, but Malone later explained that ""Post"" is his last name, and he used a ""rap name generator"" to get ""Malone"".

He was voted ""Most Likely to Become Famous"" by his classmates as a senior in high school. He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.

54,psy,1370352,29734502,"Park Jae-sang (Korean: 박재상; Hanja: 朴載相, IPA: [pɐk̚.t͡ɕεsɐŋ]; born December 31, 1977), known professionally as Psy (stylized in all caps) (싸이; /saɪ/ SY; Korean: [s͈ai]), is a South Korean singer, rapper, songwriter, and record producer. Psy is known domestically for his humorous videos and stage performances, and internationally for his hit single ""Gangnam Style"". The song's refrain was entered into The Yale Book of Quotations as one of the most famous quotations of 2012.[2]

On December 21, 2012, his music video for ""Gangnam Style"" exceeded one billion views on YouTube, becoming the first video to do so in the website's history. Psy was subsequently recognized by the media as the King of YouTube.  As of May 2023, it is the eleventh most viewed video on YouTube, with over 4.7 billion views.

In December 2012, MTV noted Psy's rise from being little known outside South Korea, to being hailed as the ""Viral Star of 2012"". On December 31, 2012, Psy performed in a globally televised New Year's Eve celebration with American rapper MC Hammer on-stage in front of a live audience of over a million people in Times Square, New York City. Following his departure from YG Entertainment in 2018, he founded his own company, P Nation, in 2019.

Park Jae-sang was born on December 31, 1977,  to an affluent family in the Gangnam District of Seoul, South Korea.[10] His father, Park Won-Ho, is the executive chairman of DI Corporation, a manufacturer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment listed on the Korea Exchange. His mother, Kim Young-hee, owns several restaurants in Gangnam.

Park attended Banpo (반포) Elementary and Middle Schools and Sehwa (세화) High School. He disliked school and was known as the class clown. In an interview on South Korea's Seoul Broadcasting System, a former teacher of Park said: ""I remember Psy making a lot of sexual jokes during class. He had such a big influence that he would drive the entire class to his jokes. I disliked him at the time, but looking back, I see that he added a great energy to the class.""

Park told CNN's Alina Cho that when he was 15 years old, he watched a Korean TV programme that introduced foreign pop music. One particular episode showed a concert at Wembley Stadium held by the British rock band Queen where they performed their 1975 hit single ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". Park said it was this concert footage that sparked his love for music.

In January 2001, Psy debuted his full-length album Psy from the Psycho World!, for which he was fined by South Korean government authorities due to his album's ""inappropriate content"". Psy was a rookie hip-hop singer that stirred up the Korean pop music scene with very blunt lyrics, peculiar dance moves and an unconventional appearance that earned him the nickname ""The Bizarre Singer(엽기가수)"".

His second album Sa 2 also created controversy upon its release in 2002, earning complaints from civil groups due to the potentially negative influence his album would have on children and teenagers. Since then, Psy has been thought of as a controversial artist, and Sa 2 was banned in 2002 from being sold to the under-19 set. In September of the same year, Psy released his third album 3 Psy. The album's title song, ""Champion"", saw great success partly due to the hype from the World Cup games held in Seoul. Despite the significant amount of controversy surrounding his music, Psy was awarded songwriting accolades at the annual Seoul Music Awards, marking his breakthrough in the South Korean music industry. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Psy"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

55,lil uzi vert,2205784,318611714,"Symere Bysil Woods (born July 31, 1995, Philadelphia, USA), known professionally as Lil Uzi Vert, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. Characterized by their face tattoos, facial piercings, eccentric hairstyles, and androgynous fashion, their music is often defined by dark subject matters and imagery built on a melodic emo approach to trap.

They attracted mainstream attention following the release of their debut single ""Money Longer"" in 2016. The song would act as the lead single for the subsequent mixtape ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World"". After releasing two additional mixtapes in 2016 and 2017, including one in collaboration with Gucci Mane, Lil Uzi Vert was featured on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. They later secured their first top 10 single with ""XO Tour Llif3"", which won the MTV Video Music Award for Song of the Summer.

""XO Tour Llif3"" acted as the lead single to Lil Uzi Vert's debut studio album ""Luv Is Rage 2"" (2017), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 2018 Grammy Awards, Lil Uzi Vert was nominated for Best New Artist. Their second studio album ""Eternal Atake"" (2020) was among the most anticipated albums in hip hop and peaked at number one on the Billboard 200.

2010–2015: Career beginnings
Woods began to rap in 2010 and began to associate with musical groups like Steaktown, in what he said was ""just for money"", under the name ""Sealab Vertical"". They later changed their name to Lil Uzi Vert from the way someone described their rap flow, saying their flow was ""Fast, like a machine gun"". Woods' first project, an EP titled ""Purple Thoughtz Vol. 1"", was released on January 19, 2014. The project, which was described as ""phonk"" and having cloud rap beats due to its psychedelic and ""trippy"" production, features a bigger focus on lyricism and was released with the single ""White Shit"". The track, produced by Spaceghostpurrp, went viral in 2017 within hip-hop circles following Woods' entry into the mainstream. Shortly after the release of their first project, Woods caught the attention of then industry-mainstays like Mob.

The EP and following features caught the attention of producer and cofounder of Atlantic Records Don Cannon after DJ Diamond Kuts played one of their songs on a local radio station. Cannon then produced and hosted their first mixtape, ""The Real Uzi"", which was released on August 5, 2014. After the release of ""The Real Uzi"", Woods signed a record deal with Atlantic Records through DJ Drama, Don Cannon's, and Leighton Morrison's imprint, Generation Now.

Following their signing to Atlantic Records, Woods was featured alongside Kid and Ferg on Carnage's single ""WDYW"". They also released several songs on SoundCloud including ""No Wait"", produced by Metro Booming, ""Pressure"", which is a collaboration with Durk, and  ''Loaf"". He was featured on Fall Out Boy and Khalifa's ""Boys of Zummer"" tour in August 2015.

Woods released their second mixtape, ""Luv Is Rage"" on October 30, 2015. The project was received positively and was featured on numerous music blogs such as Fader, XXL, and Vibe. They were further called a ""breakout artist of 2015"" by HotNewHipHop.

2016: Breakthrough
In February 2016, they released the single, ""Money Longer"" on their SoundCloud following a radio debut on Shade 45. 

On April 15, 2016, Vert released their third mixtape and first commercial mixtape ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World"". The mixtape debuted at number 37 on the Billboard 200 chart, making it their first entry on said chart. The project spent 55 weeks on the Billboard 200, eventually being certified Gold. Lil Uzi Vert and Kapri embarked on a joint tour in May 2016, titled the ""Parental Advisory"" tour.

In June 2016, Uzi appeared in XXL magazine as part of their 2016 Freshmen Class. As part of this appearance, Uzi performed a ‘freshman cypher’ alongside Denzel Curry, Lil Yachty, 21 Savage, and Kodak Black. Riding the wave of recognition the XXL Freshman list gave them, Woods released the video for the single ""Money Longer"" which debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 the following week, their first entry on the chart, at number 92 on July 2, 2016. The song later peaked at number 54 and is currently certified two times platinum in the United States.

On July 12, 2016, Woods announced their fourth mixtape, ""The Perfect LUV Tape"", which was released on July 31, their 22nd birthday. The mixtape featured the singles ""Seven Million"", featuring Future, and ""Erase Your Social"", both of which failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100.

Lil Uzi Vert announced a collaboration mixtape with Gucci Mane titled ""1017 vs. The World"", which was released on November 23, 2016. On the 27th, Uzi announced ""Luv Is Rage 2"" which went through a series of delays.

2017: Luv Is Rage 2
Uzi was featured on Migos' single ""Bad and Boujee"". The single was released on August 31, 2016, and its from the trio's second studio album ""Culture"". In January 2017, around the time the album was released, the single reached the top of the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Uzi's first number 1 single as a lead or featured artist, and their highest charting single as both. On February 27, 2017, Woods released the EP ""Luv Is Rage 1.5"" while on tour with The Weeknd. The EP was positively received for its ""nerdy"" nature, with Kingdom Hearts themed instrumentals and lyrics referring to anime, Steven Universe, and hentai. The EP was also credited as the start of Uzi's affiliation with the ""emo-rapper"" label due to the heartbreak-associated lyrics on the song ""Luv Scars K.o 1600"" and references to threats of suicide and depression on the stand-out track ""XO Tour Llif3"".

""XO Tour Llif3"" got significant popularity on SoundCloud, resulting in Uzi playing it live on the European leg of The Weeknd's tour, and the following week the song was added to streaming services and released as an official single. On April 4, 2017, ""Xo Tour Llif3"" debuted on Billboard Hot 100 at number 49 and peaked at number 7, becoming the rapper's highest charting song and biggest song, being certified 6x platinum as of August 2018.

""Luv Is Rage 2"" was delayed again on April 2, 2017, with Uzi blaming it on DJ Drama. On April 9, Don Cannon confirmed the project wasn't getting released ""any time soon"" and confirmed that ""XO Tour Llif3"" would be on the album. Uzi was featured on fellow rapper Playboi Carti's single ""wokeuplikethis*"", released on April 7. The single was performed by the pair at Coachella 2017.

""wokeuplikethis*"" was eventually certified platinum and peaked at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100. Uzi was featured alongside ASAP Rocky, Playboi Carti, Quavo, and Frank Ocean on A$AP rappers collective Mob's single ""RAF"". The single was released by surprise on May 15, 2017. In early August, hip-hop media personality DJ Akademiks claimed that ""Luv Is Rage 2"" would be released within 30 days. On August 24, 2017, ""Luv Is Rage 2"" was announced for a surprise release at midnight, and on August 25, 2017, Lil Uzi Vert released their heavily delayed debut studio album, which included ""XO TOUR Llif3"" as the lead single.

The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart, with 135,000 album-equivalent units, and has since been certified platinum. The album also created ten Billboard Hot 100 charting singles, with two of them, ""The Way Life Goes"" and ""Sauce It Up"", becoming singles. During british singer Ed Sheeran's set at the Video Music Awards, Uzi Vert and Sheeran performed a medley of ""XO Tour Llif3"" and Sheeran's chart-topping single, ""Shape Of You"".

In September 2017, Woods teased a possible sequel project to ""Lil Uzi Vert vs The World"", possibly titled ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World 2"", and a collaboration project with Playboi Carti titled ""16*29"". In October, a joint tour with Playboi Carti called the ""16*29 tour"" was announced, further promoting the possibility of a collaboration project. The tour was canceled shortly thereafter due to Uzi claiming he needed to ""focus"". In October 2017, Uzi headlined Power 105.1's annual Powerhouse music celebration alongside The Weeknd, Migos, and Cardi B, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Uzi was also featured on Canadian rapper Nav's platinum-certified single ""Wanted You"". The song was released on November 3, 2017.

On December 4, 2017, ""The Way Life Goes"" music video was released with a remix featuring Nicki Minaj. The song peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Hot 100. Uzi Vert performed the song on Stephen Colbert's The Late Show on February 6, 2018.

In January 2018, Uzi announced that he had completed a mixtape with record producer Wheezy. In May 2018, Don Cannon confirmed that a new Uzi project was dropping that year and speculation arose in July 2018 when Uzi tweeted the words ""Eternal Atake"", the title of their second studio album, pinning the tweet and announcing it was ""coming soon"", then at the end of the month sharing the then-chosen cover art for the project. The art referenced the logo of the cult Heavens Gate. The two members who survived the cult suggested that legal actions could be taken against Uzi for copying the logo style.

The art was the source of a threat from the remaining members of the organization over a legal attack. The then-thought lead single for the album, ""New Patek"" was released on September 18, 2018. Uzi was then featured on Lil Pump's single, ""Multi Millionaire"". The single was released on October 5, 2018.

In April 2019, following label trouble with Generation Now, it was announced that Uzi was now signed to Roc Nation. Two new promotional singles were released in April 2019, titled ""Sanguine Paradise"" and ""That's a Rack"", originally thought to be from their highly anticipated studio album, ""Eternal Atake"".

On December 13, 2019, Uzi released a new single titled ""Futsal Shuffle 2020"", which is the lead single of ""Eternal Atake"". The rapper then released the second single of the album, ""That Way"", on March 1, 2020.

""Eternal Atake"" was released on March 6, 2020, with a sole guest appearance from American singer Syd. ""New Patek"", ""That's a Rack"" and ""Sanguine Paradise"" did not appear on the album. ""Eternal Atake"" debuted atop the Billboard 200.

On March 12, 2020, Lil Uzi teased that the deluxe version of ""Eternal Atake"" and the sequel to their 2016 mixtape, ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World"", titled ""Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World 2"", would be released the following day, the date fans expected the release date of the original album.

The deluxe edition would have fourteen new tracks, featuring guest appearances from Chief Keef, 21 Savage, Future, Young Thug, Gunna, Lil Durk, Young Nudy, and Nav. The first half of the album maintained a leading number 1 position with 400 million streams in early 2020. This marked the largest streaming count for any album since 2018, when Lil Wayne's twelfth studio album, ""Tha Carter V"", got 433 million streams.

On April 24, 2020, Lil Uzi Vert released a new single titled ""Sasuke"". On July 10, Lil Uzi appeared on the remix of StaySolidRocky's ""Party Girl"".

Influenced by his upbringing in the Bronx, Lil Tjay is a melodic rapper who frequently incorporates auto-tune in his songs. He has drawn comparisons to fellow New York rapper A Boogie wit da Hoodie. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he revealed that his biggest musical influences are Drake, Meek Mill, and Usher. In the same interview, Lil Tjay described his music as having a melodic sound when singing or rapping about his past struggles. Lil Tjay also credits his success to his year spent in prison, where he claims that his ability to write songs peaked. In Pitchfork's featured article on Lil Tjay, he is referred to as a ""hip-hop heartthrob"". Later in the interview, Lil Tjay explained that he is often called the ""Bronx Justin Bieber"" because of his sampling Justin Bieber's ""Baby"".

57,natti natasha,306648,4361358,"Natalia Alexandra Gutiérrez, known by her stage name Natti Natasha, is a Dominican reggaeton singer, songwriter, and actress. Hailing from Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic, Natasha grew up surrounded by endless musical influences and enrolled in Santiago’s School of Fine Arts at the age of seven where she developed her singing abilities, describing her time at the school as “one of the best of her life.” Her studio experience would begin as a teenager when she would record songs as a hobby and later alongside friends.

This all led up to her decision to make the biggest and riskiest move of her life, and that was to move to the United States. She settled in the Bronx, New York, or “the City of the Dreams and Dreamers” for young, aspiring musicians like her at the time. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Natti called the move “one of the craziest moves anyone ever did in her family,” and that she often looks back at the decision and wonders what she was doing. Natti would hop from studio to studio, working without pay, but to her, this was a way to get her name out there. A producer friend from Santiago would soon step in and lend her his New York studio.

Natti’s first-ever break came when icon Don Omar signed her to his record label, the Orfanato Music Group, and the pair would go on to make history for years to come. Their collaborations “Dutty Love,” “Tus Movimientos,” “Perdido en tus Ojos,” and a “Hold Ya” remix with Gyptian made waves across Latin America and introduced the world to future reggaeton royalty. Her debut project, an EP titled “All About Me” was released on March 28, 2012.

Natti would continue to make big career moves throughout the years including her departure from Don Omar’s record label and signing onto Pina Records in 2016, but it wasn’t until 2017 when her big breakout would come once and for all.

Standout track “La Mejor Version de Mi” would transform into a bachata hit with its remix featuring bachata king Romeo Santos.

Natti’s sophomore album titled “NATTIVIDAD” would be released two years later on September 24, 2021 with 17 tracks featuring several chart-topping collaborators such as Becky G, Maluma, and Prince Royce.

Yeat continued to gain traction throughout 2020, releasing two EPs meant to hold fans over until Different Creature 2. The project was scrapped as he worked through label issues before becoming independent in 2021. 

Fully in control of his output, Yeat began releasing a barrage of music, including twenty-track albums and countless singles. Yeat saw a major jump in support after his song “Sorry Bout That” blew up on TikTok.

His primary genre of music is considered ''Aesthetic Rap'', however his initial start of his musical career started with the production of ""Bedroom Pop"" & ""Lo-Fi"" generating songs such as ""Forever In Love"", ""Sorry, I Like You"", ""I Fell In Love With You One Night In June"" & ""Pretty Girl"". 

Born in Las Vegas, Nevada, 1nonly first dabbled in Garageband in music class, often for fun without any real serious intent. However, 1nonly's first known song, Forever in Love, would be first uploaded to Soundcloud on the 16th of January, 2019. This sparked the production of his Bedroom Pop genre of music. However, his very first song, Clear Skies was published in 2018 and was emo rap. His songs were regarding love and delicate emotions, often ran by a lofi-style hip-hop beat. This genre of music would continue, with small differences such as the addition of stronger bass and percussion until the 18th of June, 2020, as the release of ""Doc Martens"" would be the song that kickstarts his now present day genre of Aesthetic Rap. This new wave of rap, wouldn't have been popularised and formed without 1nonly's own inspirations of Lil Peep, $not and many other artists that helped shaped this new genre. 

After realising the success Doc Martens received, he would later on the 15th of August, release, now a widely recognized song, Bunny Girl. This song was a massive success, receiving over tens of millions of streams across a multitude of platforms, and he would later upload an official music video to part with the song to YouTube. He continued to stick with the Aesthetic Rap genre and would go on to make memorable songs such as ""Shakira!"", ""Lovely"", ""Fuck You!"" etc. On the 11th of October, 2020, 1nonly would go onto to release his new song ""Stay with Me"". This song would reach records he had not achieved, and by date of creation has amassed over 150+ million streams on Spotify, causing it to go platinum. His unique style of lyrics and use of TikTok famous songs as sample truly secures an devoted audience. He would eventually be exclusively signed to Warner Records.

Satori Zoom, Void, & Lex Pain). He is currently part of the rap collective ""The World Is Yours"". 1nonly's most notable producers are Nategoyard, $UPREME, and Shenrxn.

As of lately, 1nonly has changed his style of making music, focusing on shaping his own sound and moving away from the Aesthetic Rap genre. His other biggest hit, ""Step Back!"" featuring SXMPRA, a Phonk rap type beat that has amassed over 100 million streams, with the song blowing up on Tiktok and a music video published onto Youtube. This goes to show his versatility in his art and the switch up on his sound in which was carried over from his music he made in 2020-2021. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/1NONLY"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Cazzu, con temas suaves que invitan a bailar y a moverse, es conocedora de todos esos géneros tan interesantes que conforman el trap argentino. Por ello, la trapera es sin duda una de las reinas del trap latino e internacional.

Se presentó en el panorama con su primer tema Killa. Una canción que sienta unas bases muy claras, una carta de presentación como mujer empoderada, llena de espíritu underground. La artista se ha ganado el respeto de todos los artistas de trap del panorama latino, llegando a colaborar con muchos de ellos.

82,papa roach,3230899,104609832,"Papa Roach is an American rock band from Vacaville, California, formed in 1993. The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist Jacoby Shaddix, guitarist Jerry Horton, drummer Dave Buckner, bassist Will James, and trombonist Ben Luther.

After two EPs, James left and was replaced by Tobin Esperance. The band independently released two more EPs before signing with DreamWorks Records in 1999, subsequently releasing the triple-platinum Infest in 2000, the gold album Lovehatetragedy in 2002 and the platinum album Getting Away with Murder in 2004. A year after The Paramour Sessions, Buckner left in 2007, and was replaced by Tony Palermo. Papa Roach then made Metamorphosis (2009), Time for Annihilation (2010), The Connection (2012), F.E.A.R. (2015), Crooked Teeth (2017) and Who Do You Trust? (2019). The group's eleventh studio album, Ego Trip, was released on April 8, 2022.

Papa Roach's formation began in January 1993, when lead singer Jacoby Shaddix and drummer Dave Buckner met on the Vacaville High School football field. They were later joined by lead guitarist Jerry Horton from nearby Vanden High School, rhythm guitarist Anne Mikolajcik, trombonist Ben Luther and bassist Will James. They decided to enter the school's talent show, performing a version of Jimi Hendrix's song ""Fire"". They ultimately ended up losing the talent show. In March 1993, Ben Luther left the band, and Anne Mikolajcik left as well. At this point, Papa Roach was practicing every day and touring, playing every gig it could get. The band's first tour van was called Moby Dick, from which Shaddix was inspired to come up with his first stage name ""Coby Dick"". Initially, the band was called ""Papa Gato"" as suggested by Buckner but Shaddix changed it to Papa Roach, mixing up the nickname of his grandfather from his mother's side —Herbert Fischer ""Papa""— and ""Roach"" coming from his grandfather from his father's side, John ""Grandpa"" Roatch. Both grandparents were musicians.

Papa Roach has been described as alternative rock, nu metal, alternative metal, rap metal, hard rock, rap rock, punk rock,  pop rock, and rapcore. The band also utilizes elements of pop, electronic, and hip hop. The band started as a hardcore punk band. In their early independent releases and on their first two major label albums, Infest and Lovehatetragedy, the band tended to use nu metal and rap metal. Before Papa Roach released their major label albums, Jacoby Shaddix's singing style was compared to Chino Moreno and Lynn Strait of Snot. Additionally, with their 2009 album, Metamorphosis, as the name expresses, the band felt that their music was going through a transformation to ""stuff that's...harder and faster"". AllMusic has compared the band's recent work to 1980s glam metal, Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote ""At the close of the 2000s, the quartet has shed the rap and the angst, ditching all the alt-metal accoutrements to become a knowing update of an '80s Sunset Strip sleaze rock outfit."" With the release of F.E.A.R., both MetalSucks and Metal Injection noted that the band has acquired some djent influences.

In 2004, frontman Jacoby Shaddix said the following in an interview with the Dallas Music Guide regarding the band no longer using rapping in their music: ""...the rapping's gone! I don't feel like rapping. I'm just over that...I just want to be a rocker. It's what I wanted to be when I was a kid"". Shaddix has added this remark in another interview: ""We're a band that tries to walk that line between metal, hardcore, punk rock and pop music, and we do our best at trying to make it all cool"".

Prior to the release of The Connection, guitarist Jerry Horton said in an interview by VerdamMnis Magazine that ""It's kind of a natural thing for us, we've always been changing throughout the years. Of course, there are some things that stay the same in our sound but we do like to try new things to sort of stretch out a little bit our basis and therefore make it more interesting"". He also said that the band was going to explore ""electronic sounds for the next record"".

The band's influences include Faith No More, Social Distortion, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Wu-Tang Clan, Fugees, Refused, Queen, and Led Zeppelin. Jacoby Shaddix acknowledges Faith No More's Mike Patton and Social Distortion's Mike Ness as major influences, stating that ""the way that I sing, I definitely was inspired by Mike Patton"", ""but I like the storytelling that Mike Ness does so I kind of fused both those two guys together at an early age, and it inspired me to become my own thing.""

In the beginning, Papa Roach's biggest influence was experimental band Mr. Bungle (fronted by Mike Patton from Faith No More), which was reflected in the adventurousness of their 1994 debut release Potatoes for Christmas.

In a 2021 interview, Jacoby Shaddix reflected about the band's long-held association with the nu metal genre, saying ""I love being one of the forefathers of nu metal, that's dope, but we've been able to outlive it and celebrate it at the same time"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Papa+Roach"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

83,$uicideboy$,1272400,340153390,"$uicideboy$ are an American hip-hop duo from New Orleans, Louisiana, founded in 2014 by cousins Ruby da Cherry and $crim. Via the music sharing platform SoundCloud, the duo rose to popularity for their abrasive, self-produced beats, as well as their harsh lyrical content and themes prominently featuring substance use disorder and suicidal ideation. The duo are considered one of the most popular artists in the underground rap scene. They own and operate their own label, G*59 Records, under which all of their music is signed. 

The music of $uicideBoy$ varies between different sub-genres of rap; while some songs have melancholy tones with lyrical content that focuses on subjects such as depression and suicidal ideation (topics not widely exposed in rap music), others are wildly aggressive, with themes of violence and sexual content. Some of their music is based around life growing up in New Orleans; song titles such as Audubon, Tulane, Elysian Fields and St. Bernard reflect streets and neighborhoods that influenced the life of Arceneaux and Petrou. A large portion of their music focuses on depression and its symptoms, an angle not often received in mainstream hip hop; Arceneaux elaborated on this in an interview with Mass Appeal, stating, “A lot of people take it as emo, or depressed music, or negative music... it’s really just connecting. It’s therapy, through music"". Excluding occasional guest producers, the entirety of Suicideboys' discography is self-produced, mainly by Arceneaux under his pseudonym Budd Dwyer (an homage to the former politician of the same name).

$crim was born Scott Arceneaux Jr. on April 11, 1989 in Marrero, Louisiana. Arceneaux originally was inspired by T-Pain and Kanye West to produce music, buying his first laptop which he used to start DJing with money gained from selling drugs. Arceneaux's passion for DJing extended when he started to attend Delgado Community College, where he was hired to DJ parties. He also worked selling used furniture, getting fired for his new hand tattoos after three years.

Ruby da Cherry was born Aristos Petrou (Αρίστος Πέτρου) on April 22, 1990 to an American mother and Greek Cypriot father. Raised in Metairie, Louisiana, Petrou's interest in music began when he was seven, playing violin and then drums when he was ten, eventually joining bands in middle school. He worked at his father's restaurant as a waiter, a job he held until 2015. His experience with the punk rock scene continued as he joined the band Vapo-Rats as its drummer; however, disillusioned with the apathy his bandmates showed towards the future of the band, Petrou left in order to pursue a career in hip-hop with Arceneaux.

Arceneaux and Petrou are cousins, and as such shared a close relationship growing up. Realising that both were interested in taking a musical career seriously, and both dissatisfied with the direction of their lives, the two formed Suicideboys, making a pact that if their musical career didn’t work out, they would both commit suicide. Elaborating on this in an interview with Mass Appeal, Arceneaux states that, “it was pretty much like cutting the hand, bleeding, and making a pact that there’s no plan B, that if this doesn’t happen by the time we’re 30, I’m blowing my head off”.

The duo's first project together, a three-track EP named Kill Yourself Part I: The $uicide $aga, was released in June 2014 on SoundCloud and Bandcamp, attracting attention for their collaboration with notable underground rapper Bones. In the following months, the duo released a further nine iterations of the Kill Yourself series. After a number of collaboration EPs with fellow underground artist Black Smurf, their first full length project titled Gray/Grey was released on March 3, 2015.

Suicideboys' underground breakthrough came with the release of 2015 EP $outh $ide $uicide, a collaboration with established South Florida rapper Pouya, which thrust the duo into the underground rap spotlight. Other 2015 releases include 7th or St. Tammany, YUNGDEATHLILLIFE, High Tide in the Snake's Nest, Grey Sheep EP, I No Longer Fear The Razor Guarding My Heel (part I and II), My Liver Will Handle What My Heart Can't, Now The Moon's Rising and G.R.E.Y.G.O.D.S. with fellow g59 rapper RAMIREZ.

 The duo's first foray onto the mainstream musical charts came with the release of Radical $uicide in the summer of 2016. The five-track EP, produced by EDM musician Getter, peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Rap charts. Other 2016 releases include Dark Side of the Clouds, Grey Sheep II, Eternal Grey, I No Longer Fear The Razor Guarding My Heel (part III), G.R.E.Y.G.O.D.S.I.I. with [artis]RAMIREZ, DIRTYNASTY$UICIDE with GERM, and Black $uicide Side C with Black Smurf.

In 2017 the boys released another 10 iterations of the Kill Yourself series, they also dropped DIRTIERNASTIER$UICIDE, with GERM.

On September 7, 2018, their debut studio album I Want to Die in New Orleans was released. A statement posted by the duo's official Instagram account stated, ""We started recording this album in the beginning of 2017. Initially we wanted to write about our experiences on the road and express how our lives had become slightly more extravagant.""

In late 2018, a rumor arose that the group had broken up following a series of ominous tweets. However, they soon clarified that the tweets were in relation to ""personal issues"" facing Arceneaux, and that they had in fact not broken up. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/$uicideboy$"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

85,falling in reverse,1067910,48996377,"Falling in Reverse is an American rock band based in Las Vegas, Nevada and formed in 2008, signed to Epitaph Records. The band is led currently by vocalist Ronnie Radke alongside bassist Tyler Burgess, lead guitarist Max Georgiev and drummer Luke Holland. 

In 2008, lead singer Ronnie Radke was involved in an altercation in Las Vegas that resulted in the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Cook. While Radke did not shoot Cook, he was indicted on battery charges. These charges, combined with Radke's past troubles with narcotics and rehab, led to a suspended sentence and five years probation. After he failed to report to his probation officer he was arrested in June 2008, where his probation was revoked and he was mandated to serve his original sentence of two years in prison. At the time, Ronnie Radke was the lead singer of post-hardcore band Escape the Fate, which in 2006, released its debut album, Dying Is Your Latest Fashion. Following Radke's incarceration, he was ejected from the band and replaced by former Blessthefall lead singer Craig Mabbitt. Max Green, bassist of Escape the Fate, stated about Radke's law problems that, ""First we couldn't tour out of the country, then out of the state."" Radke was released on December 12, 2010.

During his time in prison, Radke formed a new band called From Behind These Walls. He officially began creating media with the band upon his release, but was later forced to change its name to Falling in Reverse due to copyright infringement. In 2009, with Radke still in prison, he was able to launch a demo of his band, due to contacts with several musicians he had. The demo contains four songs that were not put on the debut album The Drug in Me Is You. The original lineup consisted of Radke and bassist Nason Schoeffler, who helped find guitarist Jacky Vincent and rhythm guitarist Derek Jones. The band went through several drummers. Nick Rich was later replaced by Oscar Garcia, Khaled Biersack, and former LoveHateHero member Scott Gee, as official members, before finding former the Bigger Lights drummer Ryan Seaman. Schoeffler quit the band in April 2011 and was replaced by Mika Horiuchi, formerly of the band Cellador, who also later departed from the band after issues with Radke.

In January 2010, the band began recording for the first time. The group announced on December 20 that it would go to Orlando, Florida to record a full-length debut album over a period of two months with a tentative release date of the first quarter of 2011. The band also confirmed that Radke's friend, Michael Baskette, who has worked on Blessthefall's album Witness and Radke on Escape the Fate's debut Dying Is Your Latest Fashion, would produce the album. It was soon confirmed that the band was signed with Epitaph Records, Radke's former label with Escape the Fate, and the band released its debut album in 2011. The album was soon titled The Drug in Me Is You and was slated for a July 26, 2011 release date, with pre-orders beginning on June 7. The eleven song track list was released soon after. With the help of Executive Producer Michael ""Elvis"" Baskette, mixing and tracking for the album concluded on April 2, 2011. The album spawned the singles ""Raised by Wolves"" and ""The Drug in Me Is You"". The band's first music video was released for ""The Drug in Me Is You"" on June 28, 2011. The Drug in Me Is You was released in the United States on July 26, 2011 to mostly mixed reviews, but managed to sell 18,000 copies in its first week in the US charting at number 19 on the Billboard 200. A third single, ""I'm Not a Vampire"", was released a few months after the album's release on October 24 with an accompanying music video.

The songs for the debut album were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. Lead vocalist Ronnie Radke has often called the album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, ""I would think all day, for days and days, about what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in different ways. I don't know why these kids love the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it.""

In January 2012, former I Am Ghost bassist Ron Ficarro began filling in as Falling in Reverse's The Drug in Me Is You Tour touring bassist due to the departure of former bassist Mika Horiuchi. Later on Ronnie announced on stage that Ron Ficarro was replacing Mika permanently.

Vocalist Ronnie Radke had been hinting on Twitter that the group had been working on the band's second album, with tweets such as ""You guys don't understand how many light years my next album is from the last one"". He and bandmate Ron Ficarro tweeted pictures of them in the studio with Ryan Ogren working on some new music. Ronnie had said a little bit about the new album to Marshal Music News. He said that, ""The last record was so vengeful and bitter and spiteful - so everyone is wondering what I'm gonna sing about next. And I'm just not quite ready to let people know. I'm sorry. When people hear the new stuff though I promise you they will lose their mind. It's light years ahead of my last album. We're demoing new songs right now, as we speak, and I'm telling you, people are seriously gonna lose their mind."" During the band's performance at Dirt Fest 2012 in Birch Run Michigan, Radke announced to the crowd that it would be the group's last show before returning to the studio for the band's second album. Ronnie also said in an interview that the band would be in the studio late 2012 with demos already and hoping for an early 2013 release.

On May 7 the band released the first single and music video, ""Alone"", from the second album, titled, Fashionably Late. The cover, merchandise, and a June 18, 2013 release date was revealed on May 7 as well.

On May 21, the title track, ""Fashionably Late"" was released as the second single. Later, on May 30, the song, ""Born to Lead"" was streamed through YouTube. The entire album was uploaded to Epitaph Records' YouTube channel on June 12, allowing fans to listen to the album before the official release date.

On October 28, 2013, Falling in Reverse, along with Ronnie's former band Escape the Fate, announced that they would be touring together, with Falling in Reverse headlining, on the Bury The Hatchet Tour. The bands posted a video through Alternative Press with Ronnie and Escape the Fate singer Craig Mabbit being interviewed about the tour, stating that the tour came about due to the groups' acceptances of each other. During the tour, Ronnie made appearances on stage with Escape the Fate, singing the singles from Escape the Fate debut album Dying Is Your Latest Fashion (""Situations"" and ""Not Good Enough for Truth in Cliché"").

In March 2014, Radke announced that the band had begun recording its third album. On May 12, 2014, it was announced by Alternative Press that Falling in Reverse had parted ways with bassist Ron Ficarro, reporting that former Escape the Fate bassist Max Green (who announced his departure from Escape the Fate just 3 days before on May 9, six months after rejoining Escape the Fate) would be his replacement. Ronnie is quoted as saying ""Ron was probably the best bass player I've ever played with, but at this moment in time I feel it is best to part ways with him. I respect him and wish nothing but the best for him. Max quitting Escape The Fate was like a godsend. It was a no brainer to have him join. I've known him half my life and this will be a great new chapter to start. ""

In an interview with MTV, Radke stated that the next album would be nothing like the single Alone from Fashionably Late as it has no raps throughout the album; he stated that it is heavier and will contain more screams, moving his passion for rapping into his solo career. Radke explained in another interview that the third album will be more like a ""sequel"" to the Escape the Fate album Dying Is Your Latest Fashion and is aimed to be nostalgic to people who were fans of the band since then.

On December 15, 2014, the first single from the band's third album, Just Like You, titled ""God, If You Are Above..."" was released. On January 13, 2015, the group released its second single ""Guillotine IV (The Final Chapter)"" from the album. Just Like You was released on February 24. In February 2015, touring bassist Jonathan Wolfe was replaced by the official new member, and former Black Tide bassist, Zakk Sandler. ""Stay Away"", another single off of Just Like You, premiered on the BBC Radio1 Rock Show on February 15. The group premiered its new single, Sexy Drug, via Alternative Press the next day.

On February 17, 2015, a full album stream of Just Like You was released, a week before the scheduled release of the album. On February 24, 2015, Just Like You was released as planned, along with a music video for the song Just Like You.

On October 30, 2015, lead guitarist Jacky Vincent left the band on good terms before the band's fall tour with Attila, Metro Station and Assuming We Survive to focus on his solo career. On November 4, 2015, Christian Thompson confirmed himself as the new lead guitarist of the band. The video for the single Chemical Prisoner was released on January 27, 2016. The single performed moderately well on UK rock radio.

On January 6, 2016, the band members announced that they had begun work on their next album stating that it would be ""It's a huge left turn. It sounds like nothing we’ve ever done. Every song is very vibey, There's more feeling in it instead of a lot of metal."", further stating that ""We’re challenging ourselves now more than we ever have in the weirdest ways possible because you would think writing the craziest solo or riffs would be the challenging part. But the challenging part is trying to stick to a theme and not go all over the place like we would normally do."" On December 19, the band officially released the first single ""Coming Home"" from the untitled album. In January 2017, Radke began performing guitar for the band. On January 20, 2017, the band announced their next album Coming Home, which was released on April 7. Around the time of its release, it was rumoured that drummer Ryan Seaman parted ways with the band. This was confirmed when the band performed on May 8, without Seaman with Chris Kamrada playing drums as a touring member, who since left to play for Dashboard Confessional.

On February 23 2018, the band released a song called, Losing My Mind.

On April 16 2018, Christian officially announced via his Instagram page that his time with Falling In Reverse had come to an end. Though there was some controversy over the exact reason behind it, claims came from both sides that the departure was mutual but talk arose of irreconcilable differences and a decision was made to go separate ways. It has since been claimed that the split was due to differences between members causing an uneasy working environment.

On June 26, 2018, the band released a song called, Losing My Life along with a music video as a continuation of where the music video for Losing My Mind ended and featured a new line-up for the band which consists of Tyler Burgess on bass, Max Georgiev as lead guitarist, drummer Brandon ""Rage"" Richter, and Zakk Sandler on keyboards and rhythm guitar. The band also announced that they will be performing selected dates at the final year of the annual Vans Warped Tour with the new line up.

In April 2020, rhythm guitarist Derek Jones passed away. He was 35 years old. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Falling+in+Reverse"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

87,chris brown,4137625,111998977,"There is more than one artist with this name:

1) Christopher Maurice Brown (born May 5, 1989) from Tappahannock, Virginia.

In late 2005, he released his first studio album, Chris Brown, which spawned the Billboard Hot 100 number-one debut single, ""Run It!"" which was produced by Scott Storch and featured Juelz Santana. The album also produced two other top ten singles: ""Yo (Excuse Me Miss)"" and ""Say Goodbye."" Brown's second studio album, Exclusive was released worldwide in November 2007. It has spawned his second US number one hit, ""Kiss Kiss"" which was produced by T-Pain, who was also featured in the song . The third single, ""With You"", has reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and has entered into the top ten in several countries across the world, becoming one of his most successful worldwide releases to date.

The second single, ""Kiss Kiss"", was nominated for the 50th Annual Grammy Awards in the category for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.

Brown, one of two children, was born and raised in the small town of Tappahannock, Virginia, the son of Joyce Hawkins and Clinton Brown. Brown was influenced by the artists his parents played on the home radio, such as Michael Jackson and Sam Cooke. A dancer since the age of two, Brown was not aware of his vocal talents until the age of eleven. Before becoming a vocalist, he was interested in becoming a rapper.

At thirteen, Brown was discovered by a local production team who visited his father's gas station searching for new talent. Since then, he began his recording career and moved to New York, staying there for two years. Brown's local production team organized an audition before Def Jam Vice President Tina Davis, who currently works as his manager. At the age of 15, Brown was then sent to perform for L.A.

90,nsqk,64978,6876897,"Nacido en Monterrey, Nuevo León (México) y criado en Houston, Texas (Estados Unidos de América), Rodrigo Torres de la Garza, mejor conocido como NSQK (Nesquick), es un productor y cantante que mezcla notas de los géneros Pop, Rap, R&B, Rock y EDM para crear música con la intención de romper barreras de géneros y temas.

Es co-fundador y miembro del colectivo regiomontano No Pedí Permiso, forma parte del dúo de música pop-urbana Southboys y más recientemente, comienza su carrera solista.

El 31 de enero de 2020 lanzó su EP debut Botánica, un trabajo brutalmente honesto que habla de las altas y bajas de una relación amorosa y los sentimientos que implican éstas; como los celos, enojo, amor, tristeza y el poder aceptar que uno se siente vulnerable. Lanzó varios sencillos con diversos artistas emergentes como Cesxr, Riosse, Nicole Horts, Noa Sainz, Daaz y Absa G. Aunque la carrera de NSQK es aún es muy corta, la cantidad de material con el que cuenta es amplia, pues en 2021 lanzo dos EPs llamados Braille junto a Mene, y Brailluxe, siendo este último únicamente de tres sencillos donde uno de ellos cuenta con la colaboración de Tino el Pingüino.

A finales del 2022 se realizó el lanzamiento oficial de ROY, que tardó alrededor de tres años en producirse. Parte de experiencias personales de la vida de Rodrigo pero también de la idea de que no hay experiencias únicas, ya que en diversas ocasiones todos hemos llegado a tener un sentimiento o vivencia similar. ROY viene con una propuesta sumamente más personal que se puede notar en los beats o en las letras de las canciones al regresar un poco a sus orígenes para recordarnos a Botánica, aquel EP donde Rodri se presentaba en solitario, ya que si había una colaboración, la idea o el discurso inicial que se estaba buscando podría perderse un poco y no sería tan personal como en un inicio. Esto nos permite ver a un NSQK un poco más maduro, alineado a sus gustos considerando que esto es mucho mejor y auténtico en cuando a esa esencia propia por la música electrónica. 

En este material se trató de buscar referencias plásticas tanto para las portadas de los sencillos como la del disco que lograran hacer esa alusión al sentimiento de cada canción como lo podemos ver en “Cuando me vaya” haciendo referencia a 'Iván el Terrible y su Hijo', de Ilia Repin o la portada del disco que tiene una gran referencia a 'El Ángel Caído', de Alexandre Cabanel. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Nsqk"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

91,dr. dre,3593353,75486732,"André Romelle Young (born February 18, 1965 in Los Angeles, California), better known by his stage name Dr. Dre, is an American record producer, rapper, actor and record executive. He is the founder and current CEO of Aftermath Entertainment and a former co-owner and artist of Death Row Records, also having produced albums for and overseeing the careers of many rappers signed to those record labels. As a producer he is credited as a key figure in the popularization of West Coast G-funk, a style of rap music characterized as synthesizer-based with slow, bass heavy beats. 
Dr. Dre began his career in music as a member of the World Class Wreckin' Cru and he later found fame with the influential gangsta rap group N.W.A, which popularized the use of explicit lyrics in rap to detail the violence of street life. His 1992 solo debut The Chronic, released under Death Row Records, led him to become one of the best-selling American performing artists of 1993. In 1996 he left Death Row to found his own label Aftermath Entertainment, producing a compilation album, Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath, in 1997 and releasing a solo album titled 2001 in 1999.

During the 2000s he focused his career on production for other artists, while occasionally contributing vocals in other artists' songs. Rolling Stone named him among the highest-paid performers of 2001 and 2004. Dr. Dre also had acting roles in the 2001 films The Wash and Training Day. In 2011, his final solo studio album, Detox, is set to be released following much delay and speculation.

Early life

The first child of Verna and Theodore Young, Dr. Dre was born as André Romelle Young on February 18, 1965. His mother was only 16 years old at the time of his birth, after being impregnated by teenage boyfriend Theodore, whom she later married. Young's middle name, ""Romelle"", came from Theodore Young's unsigned, amateur R&B singing group The Romells. In 1968 his mother divorced Theodore Young for another man, Curtis Crayon, and had other children with him, including two sons named Jerome and Tyree (both of whom are now deceased)[8][9] and daughter Shameka.[10] As a young child, Young was fascinated with vinyl records spinning on phonographs; his family's record collection included many popular R&B albums of the 1960s and 1970s, from such singers as Diana Ross, James Brown, and Aretha Franklin. According to an interview with the Los Angeles Times, his mother Verna found R&B music to be a relief from the two jobs she had to work daily.[11] Despite economic troubles, she continued to encourage Young not to give up in life. During Verna's second marriage, Young and his step-brother Tyree were raised primarily by their grandmother and Curtis Crayon, as their mother spent much time in search of work.[12]

In 1976 Young began attending Vanguard Junior High School and had a new sister named Shameka. However, due to gang violence around Vanguard, he transferred to nearby Roosevelt Junior High School.[13] Verna later married Warren Griffin, whom she met at her new job in Long Beach,[14] which added three new stepsisters and one new stepbrother to the family. The stepbrother, Warren Griffin III, would eventually become a rapper under the stage name Warren G.[15]

Young attended Centennial High School in Compton during his freshman year in 1979 but transferred to Fremont High School due to poor grades. On December 15, 1981, Young fathered a son with Lisa Johnson, however Curtis Young was not brought up by his father and they only met when Curtis had become rapper Hood Surgeon about 20 years later.[16] He was nearly enrolled to an apprenticeship program at Northrop Aviation Company until poor grades at school made him ineligible. Therefore, he focused on social life and entertainment for most of his high school years.[17]

Music career

World Class Wreckin' Cru (1984–1985)
Inspired by the Grandmaster Flash song ""The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel"", he often attended a club called The Eve After Dark to watch many DJs and rappers performing live. Thus, he became a DJ in the club, initially under the name ""Dr. J"" based on the nickname for Julius Erving, his favorite basketball player. At the club, he met aspiring rapper Antoine Carraby, later to become member DJ Yella of his group N.W.A.[18] Soon afterwards he adopted the moniker Dr. Dre, a mix of previous alias Dr. J and his first name, referring to himself as the ""Master of Mixology"".[19] He later joined the musical group World Class Wreckin' Cru under the independent Kru-Cut Records in 1984. The group would become stars of the electro-hop scene that dominated early 1980s West Coast hip hop, and their first hit ""Surgery"" would prominently feature Dr. Dre on the turntables and sell 50,000 copies within the Compton area.[20] Dr. Dre and DJ Yella also performed mixes for local radio station KDAY, boosting ratings for its afternoon rush-hour show The Traffic Jam.[21]

Due to the amount of time Dr. Dre was spending on his rap music he frequently skipped school, affecting his education. His absences also jeopardized his position as a diver for his school's swim team. However, when he did attend he received good grades in certain classes. After high school, he attended Chester Adult School in Compton following his mother's demands for him to get a job or go to school. After brief attendance at a radio broadcasting school, he relocated to the residence of his father and residence of his grandparents before returning to his mother's house.[22] He later dropped out of Chester to focus on performing at the Eve's After Dark nightclub.[23]

N.W.A and Ruthless Records (1986–1991)
In 1986 he met rapper Ice Cube, who collaborated with Dr. Dre to record songs for Ruthless Records, a rap record label run by local rapper and drug dealer Eazy-E. N.W.A however, along with fellow west coast rapper Ice T, debuted with rhymes including profanity and gritty depictions of crime and life on the street. No longer constricted to racially charged political issues pioneered by rap artists such as Public Enemy or Boogie Down Productions, N.W.A shot out with hardcore and realistic perspective of street violence and local black gangster lifestyle. Propelled by the hit ""Fuck tha Police"", the group's first full album Straight Outta Compton became a major success, despite an almost complete absence of radio airplay or major concert tours and warnings from the FBI.[2] The FBI sent letters to Arabian Prince, Ice Cube and Eazy-E urging them to stop releasing their music as a response to the large amount of complaints they had received about the group's lyrical content and use of expletives.[24]

After Ice Cube left N.W.A over financial disputes, Dr. Dre produced and performed for much of the group's second album Efil4zaggin. He also produced tracks for a number of other rap acts on Ruthless Records, including Above the Law, and The D.O.C. for the album No One Can Do It Better.[25] In 1991 at a music industry party in Hollywood, he assaulted television host Dee Barnes of the Fox television program Pump it Up, after he felt dissatisfied by a news report of hers on the feud between the remaining N.W.A members and Ice Cube. Thus, Dr. Dre was fined $2,500 and given two years' probation and 240 hours of community service, as well as a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television.[26][27]

The Chronic and Death Row Records (1992–1995)
After a dispute with Wright, Young left the group at the peak of its popularity in 1991 under the advice of friend, and N.W.A lyricist, The D.O.C. and his bodyguard at the time, Suge Knight. Knight, a notorious strongman and intimidator, was able to have Wright release Young from his contract and, using Dr. Dre as his flagship artist, found Death Row Records. In 1992 Young released his first single, the title track to the film Deep Cover, a collaboration with a rapper whom he met through his own stepbrother and rapper Warren G, Snoop Dogg.[2] Dr. Dre's debut album was The Chronic under Death Row Records. Young ushered in a new style of rap, both in terms of musical style and lyrical content.[28]

On the strength of singles such as ""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang"", featuring protegé Snoop Doggy Dogg and hits like ""Let Me Ride"" and ""Fuck wit Dre Day (and Everybody's Celebratin')"" (known as ""Dre Day"" for radio and television play), The Chronic became a cultural phenomenon, its G-funk sound dominating much of hip hop music for the early 1990s.[2] In 1993 the Recording Industry Association of America certified the album multi-platinum,[29] and Dr. Dre also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for his performance in ""Let Me Ride"".[30] For that year, Billboard magazine also ranked Dr. Dre as the eighth best-selling musical artist, The Chronic as the sixth best-selling album, and ""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang"" as the 11th best-selling single.[3]

Besides working on his own material, Dr. Dre produced Snoop Dogg's debut album Doggystyle, which became the first debut album for an artist to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 album charts.[31] Young also produced other West Coast rap albums of Death Row Records, including Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound and the album Regulate...G Funk Era by his stepbrother Warren G. In 1994 Dr. Dre produced the soundtracks to the films Above the Rim and Murder Was the Case and the single ""No Diggity"" by Blackstreet. He collaborated with fellow N.W.A member Ice Cube for the song ""Natural Born Killaz"" in 1995.[2]

In 1995, just as Death Row Records was signing rapper 2Pac and positioning him as their major star, Young left the label amidst a contract dispute and growing concerns that label boss Suge Knight was corrupt, financially dishonest and out of control. Thus, in 1996, he formed his own label Aftermath Entertainment directly underneath the distributor label for Death Row Records, Interscope Records.[2] Consequently, Death Row Records suffered poor sales by 1997, especially following the death of 2Pac and the racketeering charges brought against Knight.[32]

Move to Aftermath Entertainment (1996–1998)
The Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath album, released on November 26, 1996, featured songs by Dr. Dre himself as well as by newly signed Aftermath artists, and a solo track ""Been There, Done That"", intended as a symbolic farewell to gangsta rap.[33] Despite being classified platinum by the RIAA[34], the album was not very popular among music fans.[2] In October 1996 Dr. Dre appeared on the sketch comedy program Saturday Night Live, broadcast on the NBC television network in the United States, to perform ""Been There, Done That"".[35] In 1997 Young produced several tracks on Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Nature Present The Firm: The Album; although the album went platinum, it was met with similarly negative reviews from critics. Rumors began to abound that Aftermath was facing financial difficulties.[36]

The turning point for Aftermath came in 1998, when Jimmy Iovine, the head of Aftermath's parent label Interscope, suggested that Young sign the white Detroit rapper Marshall Mathers, artistically known as Eminem, to Aftermath. Young produced three songs and provided vocals for two on his controversial album, (""My Name Is"", ""Guilty Conscience"" and ""Role Model"") in 1999.[37]

2001 (1999–2000)
Dr. Dre's second solo album, 2001, released in the fall of 1999, was considered an ostentatious return to his gangsta rap roots.[38] It was initially titled The Chronic 2000 to imply being a sequel to his debut album The Chronic but was re-titled 2001 after Death Row Records released an unrelated compilation album earlier in 1999. Other tentative titles included The Chronic 2001 and Dr. Dre.[39] The album featured numerous collaborators, including Devin the Dude, Hittman, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg and Eminem. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the website All Music Guide described the sound of the album as ""adding ominous strings, soulful vocals, and reggae"" to Dr. Dre's style.[38] The album was highly successful, charting at number two on the Billboard 200 charts[40] and has since been certified six times platinum,[29] thus reaffirming a recurring theme featured in its lyrics, stating that Dr. Dre was still a force to be reckoned with, despite the lack of major releases in the previous few years. The album included popular hit singles ""Still D.R.E."" and ""Forgot About Dre"", both of which Dr. Dre performed on NBC's Saturday Night Live on October 23, 1999.[41] Dr. Dre won the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year in 2000,[2] and joined the Up in Smoke Tour with fellow rappers Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and Ice Cube that year as well.[42]
During the course of the popularity of 2001, Dr. Dre was involved in several lawsuits. Lucasfilm Ltd., the film company behind the Star Wars film franchise, sued him over the use of the THX-trademarked ""Deep Note"".[43] The Fatback Band also sued Dr. Dre over alleged infringement of its song ""Backstrokin'"" in his song ""Let's Get High"" from the 2001 album; Dr. Dre was ordered to pay $1.5 million to the band in 2003.[44] The online music file-sharing company Napster also settled a lawsuit with him and heavy metal rock band Metallica in the summer of 2001, agreeing to block access to certain files that artists do not want to have shared on the network.[45]

Focus on production (2001–present)
Following the success of 2001, Dr. Dre focused on producing songs and albums for other artists. He produced the single ""Family Affair"" by R&B singer Mary J. Blige for her album No More Drama in 2001.[4] Other successful albums that he produced for Aftermath have included the major-label debut album by Queens, New York-based rapper 50 Cent, Get Rich or Die Tryin', in 2003. The album featured the Dr. Dre-produced hit single ""In da Club"", as a joint production between Aftermath, Eminem's boutique label Shady Records and Interscope.[46] Dr. Dre also produced ""How We Do"", a 2005 hit single of rapper The Game from his album The Documentary.[47]
Another copyright-related lawsuit came upon Dr. Dre in the fall of 2002, when Sa Re Ga Ma, a film and music company based in Calcutta, India, sued Aftermath Entertainment over an uncredited sample of the Lata Mangeshkar song ""Thoda Resham Lagta Hai"" on the Aftermath-produced song ""Addictive"" by singer Truth Hurts. In February 2003, a judge ruled that Aftermath would have to halt sales of Truth Hurts' album Truthfully Speaking if the company would not credit Mangeshkar.[48] In April 2003 rapper Ja Rule released a mixtape of freestyle raps criticizing Dr. Dre and his associated artists 50 Cent and Eminem.[49] At the Vibe magazine awards show in November 2004, Dr. Dre was attacked by a fan named Jimmy James Johnson, who was asking for an autograph. Johnson, in September 2005, was sentenced to a year in prison and ordered to stay away from Dr. Dre until 2008.[50] For an issue of Rolling Stone magazine in April 2005, Kanye West praised Dr. Dre as among the greatest performing artists of all time.[51]

In November 2006 Dr. Dre began working with Raekwon on his album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II.[52] He also contributed to the rap albums Buck the World by Young Buck[53] and Curtis by 50 Cent.[54] Other upcoming albums that he is involved with includeThe Reformation by Bishop Lamont,[55] The Nacirema Dream by Papoose,[56] Here I Am by Eve,[57] and L.A.X. by The Game.[58] Among planned but unreleased albums during Dr. Dre's tenure at Aftermath have included a full-length reunion with Snoop Dogg titled Breakup to Makeup, an album with fellow former N.W.A member Ice Cube which was to be titled Heltah Skeltah, an N.W.A reunion album, and a joint album with fellow producer Timbaland titled Chairmen of the Board.[59][25][60]

Detox: Final album
Detox is to be Dr. Dre's final album.[7] In 2002, Dre told Corey Moss of MTV News that he intended Detox to be a concept album.[6] Work for the album dates back to early 2004,[61] but later in that year he decided to stop working on the album to focus on producing for other artists but then changed his mind; the album had initially been set for a fall 2005 release.[62] After several delays, the album was finally scheduled to be released sometime in 2008 by Interscope Records, which has not set a firm release date for the album as of September 2007.[7] Producers confirmed to work on the album include Bernard ""Focus"" Edwards Jr.,[63] Hi-Tek,[64] J.R. Rotem,[65] RZA,[66] Jay-Z,[67] and Warren G.[68]

Film career
In 2001 Dr. Dre appeared in the movies The Wash and Training Day.[69] A song of his, ""Bad Intentions"" (featuring Knoc-Turn'Al) and produced by Mahogany, was featured on The Wash soundtrack.[70] Dr. Dre also appeared on two other songs ""On the Blvd."" and ""The Wash"" along with his co-star Snoop Dogg. In February 2007 it was announced that Dr. Dre would produce dark comedies and horror films for New Line-owned company Crucial Films, along with longtime video director Phillip Atwell. Dr. Dre announced ""This is a natural switch for me, since I've directed a lot of music videos, and I eventually want to get into directing.""[71]

Musical influences and style
Dr. Dre has said that his primary instrument in the studio is the Akai MPC3000, a drum machine and sampler, and that he uses as many as four or five to produce a single recording. He cites George Clinton, Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield as primary musical influences. Unlike most rap producers, he tries to avoid samples as much as possible, preferring to have studio musicians re-play pieces of music he wants to use, because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo.[59] In 2001 he told Time magazine, ""I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but I'd rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it. I can control it better.""[72] Other equipment he uses include the E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and other keyboards from such manufacturers as Korg, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Moog, and Roland.[73]

After founding Aftermath Entertainment in 1996, Dr. Dre took on producer Mel-Man as a co-producer, and his music took on a more synthesizer-based sound, using fewer vocal samples (as he had used on ""Lil' Ghetto Boy"" and ""Let Me Ride"" on The Chronic, for example). Mel-Man has not shared co-production credits with Dr. Dre since approximately 2002, but fellow Aftermath producer Focus has credited Mel-Man as a key architect of the signature Aftermath sound.[74]

In 1999 Dr. Dre started working with Mike Elizondo, a bassist, guitarist, and keyboardist who has also produced, written and played on records for female singers such as Poe, Fiona Apple and Alanis Morissette,[75] for his album 2001. Elizondo has since worked for many of Dr. Dre's productions.[76][77] Dr. Dre also told Scratch magazine in a 2004 interview that he has been studying piano and music theory formally, and that a major goal is to accumulate enough musical theory to score movies. In the same interview he stated that he has collaborated with famed 1960s songwriter Burt Bacharach by sending him hip hop beats to play over, and hopes to have an in-person collaboration with him in the future.[59]

Work ethic
Dr. Dre has stated that he is a perfectionist, and is known to pressure the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances.[59] In 2006 Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr. Dre had made new artist Chauncey Black re-record a single bar of vocals 107 times.[78] Dr. Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his like-minded work ethic.[59]

A consequence of this perfectionism is that some artists that initially sign deals with Dr. Dre's Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie The Wash. featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr. Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include King Tee, 2001 vocalist Hittman and 1980s rap icon Rakim.[79]

However, over the years word of other collaborators has surfaced. During his tenure at Death Row Records, it was alleged that Dr. Dre's half brother Warren G and Tha Dogg Pound member Daz made many uncredited contributions to songs on his solo album The Chronic and Snoop Doggy Dogg's album Doggystyle (Daz received production credits on Snoop's similar-sounding, albeit less successful album Tha Doggfather after Young left Death Row Records).[80]

It is known that Scott Storch, who has since gone on to become a successful producer in his own right, contributed to Dr. Dre's second album 2001; Storch is credited as a songwriter on several songs and played keyboards on several tracks. In 2006 he told Rolling Stone:

    ""At the time, I saw Dr. Dre desperately needed something,"" Storch says. ""He needed a fuel injection, and Dr. Dre utilized me as the nitrous oxide. He threw me into the mix, and I sort of tapped on a new flavor with my whole piano sound and the strings and orchestration. So I'd be on the keyboards, and Mike [Elizondo] was on the bass guitar, and Dr. Dre was on the drum machine"".[81]

Current collaborator Mike Elizondo, when speaking about his work with Young, describes their recording process as a collaborative effort involving several musicians. In 2004 he claimed to Songwriter Universe magazine that he had written the foundations of the hit Eminem song ""The Real Slim Shady"", stating, ""I initially played a bass line on the song, and Dr. Dre, Tommy Coster Jr. and I built the track from there. Eminem then heard the track, and he wrote the rap to it.""[77] This account is essentially confirmed by Eminem in his book Angry Blonde, stating that the tune for the song was composed by a studio bassist and keyboardist while Dr. Dre was out of the studio but later programmed the song's beat after returning.[82]

Furthermore, in the September 2003 issue of The Source, a group of disgruntled former associates of Dr. Dre complained that they had not received their full due for work on the label. A producer named Neff-U claimed to have produced the songs ""Say What You Say"" and ""My Dad's Gone Crazy"" on The Eminem Show, the songs ""If I Can't"" and ""Back Down"" on 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin', and the beat featured on Dr. Dre's commercial for Coors beer.[79]

Although Young studies piano and musical theory, he serves as more of a conductor than a musician himself, as Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine has noted:

    Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine in a room full of trusted musicians. (They carry beepers. When he wants to work, they work.) He'll program a beat, then ask the musicians to play along; when Dre hears something he likes, he isolates the player and tells him how to refine the sound. ""My greatest talent,"" Dre says, ""is knowing exactly what I want to hear.""[72]

Although Snoop Dogg retains working relationships with Warren G and Daz, who are alleged to be uncredited contributors on the hit albums The Chronic and Doggystyle, he states that Dr. Dre is capable of making beats without the help of collaborators.[83] It should be noted that Dr. Dre's prominent studio collaborators, including Scott Storch, Elizondo, Mark Batson and Dawaun Parker, have shared co-writing, instrumental, and more recently co-production credits on the songs where he is credited as the producer.

It is also widely acknowledged that most of Dr. Dre's raps are written for him by others, though he retains ultimate control over his lyrics and the themes of his songs. As Aftermath Producer Mahogany told Scratch: ""It's like a class room in [the booth]. He'll have three writers in there. They'll bring in something, he'll recite it, then he'll say. 'Change this line, change this word,' like he's grading papers.""[84] As seen in the credits for tracks Young has appeared on, there are often multiple people who contribute to his songs (although it should be noted that often in hip hop many people are officially credited as a writer for a song, even the producer). As a member of N.W.A, The D.O.C. wrote lyrics for him while he stuck with producing.[85] Popular rapper Jay-Z ghostwrote lyrics for the single ""Still D.R.E."" from Dr. Dre's album 2001.[39]

Personal life

Marriages and family

From 1990 to 1996 Dr. Dre dated singer Michel'le, who frequently contributed vocals to Death Row Records albums. In 1991 the couple had a son, Marcel. In May 1996 Dr. Dre married Nicole Threatt, who was formerly married to NBA player Sedale Threatt.[86] Dr. Dre and Nicole have two children together: a son named Truth (born 1997) and a daughter named Truly (born 2001).[87] He is also the biological father of rapper Hood Surgeon (real name Curtis Young), impregnating his mother, Lisa Johnson, at 16 when he was 17.[88]

Income

In 2001, Dr. Dre earned a total of about $52 million from selling part of his share of Aftermath Entertainment to Interscope Records and his production of such hit songs that year as ""Family Affair"" by Mary J. Blige. Rolling Stone magazine thus named him the second highest-paid artist of the year.[4] Dr. Dre was ranked 44th in 2004 from earnings of just $11.4 million, primarily from production royalties from such projects as albums from G-Unit and D12 and the single ""Rich Girl"" by singer Gwen Stefani and rapper Eve.[5]

92,kouz1,18954,299439,
93,manal,34759,476051,"There are at least two artists named Manal:

1.  A Moroccan female Pop/R&B/hip-hop vocalist, originally from Kalaat Sraghna, Manal grew up in Marrakesh where she studied business and finance. Having always wanted to be a musical artist, she posted covers on YouTube and was discovered by Hamza Ait Khali, the partner of Moroccan producer DJ Van.

After a short stint with DJ Van's label Magic Castle Entertainment and the release of her debut single Denia, which earned her the 'Best Female Artist in Northern Africa' award at the Africa Music Awards in 2015, she switched management to Tarik Azzougarh, better known as Cilvaringz, producer and conceptualizer of the world's most expensive musical work ever sold, Wu-Tang Clan's Once Upon A Time in Shaolin.

Manal followed up her debut single with her song Koulchi Ban, the last song she would do with DJ Van. The release of Koulchi Ban received critical acclaim from fans and sparked the interest of Sony Music Middle East. In October 2017, Manal became one of the first Moroccan artists to sign to a major label in the Arab world.

In February 2018, Manal released her third single Taj (Crown). Due to its music video and a significant departure from Manal's signature sound, Taj started a buzz and garnered millions of views quickly. It is one of the most viewed Arabic rap songs performed by a female artist. After Taj, Manal released the song Nah featuring Moroccan rap duo Shayfeen and then had one of her biggest singles to date, Slay, in collaboration with ElGrandeToto.

In November 2019, Manal signed a distribution deal with RCA Records, a division of Sony Music France, through her record company Bench & Guess Entertainment.

Currently, she is under an exclusive license agreement with the same label, and under a music publishing agreement with Universal Music Publishing.

Manal's current management team includes Anissa Jalab, former manager of Belgian rapper Damso, head of Wagram Belgium, and also manager of ElGrandeToto.

In May 2021, Manal released her first album entitled 360, which included the hit single Niya.

Deprived of the stage during the COVID-19 pandemic, she launched, with the help of her husband Moncef Guessous, a streetwear brand called Bari & Soch.

In November 2021, Manal earned the 'Best Female Artist in Northern Africa' award at the 2021 All Africa Music Awards for the second time in her career.

In May 2022, Manal performed ""3ARI"" for COLORS. In October 2022, she was chosen to feature in Light The Sky, a song for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, collaborating with artists, RedOne, Balqees, Rahma Riad and Nora Fatehi.


2. Manal was a blues band from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Formed in 1968 by Javier Martínez (drums and vocals), Claudio Gabis (guitar) and Alejandro Medina (bass), the band is considered a fundamental pillar in the birth of Argentine rock. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Manal"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

94,eminem,6924087,455843622,"Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972 in St. Joseph, MO), known professionally as Eminem (stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is credited with popularizing hip-hop in Middle America and is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time. His success is considered to have broken racial barriers to the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as influencing many musical artists. His most successful songs on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 include ""The Real Slim Shady"", ""Without Me"", ""Lose Yourself"", ""Not Afraid"", ""Love the Way You Lie"", ""The Monster"", ""Godzilla"", and ""Houdini"".

After the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2002. After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry with the releases of Relapse (2009) and Recovery (2010), the latter becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2010. He then released the U.S. number-one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018), Music to Be Murdered By (2020), and The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) (2024).

Eminem was also a member of the hip-hop groups New Jacks, Soul Intent, Outsidaz, and D12, and has collaborated with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9"" as the duo Bad Meets Evil. Eminem starred in the 2002 musical drama film 8 Mile playing a dramatized version of himself. ""Lose Yourself"", a song from its soundtrack, topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 weeks—the most for a solo rap song—and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making him the first hip-hop artist ever to win the award. He also co-founded Shady Records, which helped launch the careers of artists such as D12, 50 Cent, and Obie Trice, and established his own Sirius XM Radio channel, Shade 45.

Eminem is amongst the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States for the 2000s, placing third for the 2010s. He was the first artist to have ten albums consecutively debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and has had five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits (2005), ""Lose Yourself"", ""Love the Way You Lie"", and ""Not Afraid"" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. Billboard named him the ""Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)"", and Rolling Stone named him one of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"" and ""100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time"". In 2022, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Early life

Marshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah ""Debbie"" (née Nelson). His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him. Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before they separated. His father abandoned his family when Eminem was a year and a half old, and Eminem was raised only by his mother, Debbie, in poverty. He wrote letters to his father, but Debbie said that they all came back marked ""return to sender"".

By the age of twelve, Eminem and his mother shuttled between states, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and mostly living with family members, moved several times and lived in St. Joseph, Savannah, Missouri, Kansas City, Warren, Michigan and Roseville, Michigan before settling in Detroit. For much of his youth, Eminem and his mother lived in a working-class, primarily black, Detroit neighborhood. He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten several times by black youths. His mother had a son named Nathan ""Nate"" Kane Samara.

Eminem frequently fought with his mother, whom a social worker described as having a ""very suspicious, almost paranoid personality"". When he was a child, a bully named D'Angelo Bailey severely injured Eminem's head in an assault, an incident which Eminem later recounted (with comic exaggeration) on the song ""Brain Damage"". Debbie filed a lawsuit against the public school for this in 1982. The suit was dismissed the following year by a Macomb County, Michigan, judge, who said the schools were immune from lawsuits.

Eminem was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic book artist before discovering hip-hop. He heard his first rap song (""Reckless"", featuring Ice-T) on the Breakin' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie's half-brother, Ronnie Polkingharn. His uncle was close to the boy and later became a musical mentor to him. Following Polkingharn's suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking publicly for days and did not attend his funeral.

At age 14, Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names ""Manix"" and ""M&M"", the latter evolving into ""Eminem"". Eminem snuck into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles. On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile Road, considered ""ground zero"" for the Detroit rap scene. Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip-hop audiences. When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable. Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes.

In 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Anne ""Kim"" Scott to stay at their home. Several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott. After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades, 17-year-old Eminem dropped out of Lincoln High School. Although interested in English, Eminem never explored literature, preferring comic books, and he disliked math and social studies. He states that he later received a GED.Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills, one of which was at Little Caesar's Pizza in Warren. He later said she often threw him out of the house anyway, often after taking most of his paycheck. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.

Alter egos

Eminem uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter, including Slim Shady and Ken Kaniff, among others.

Slim Shady is the controversial and rebellious alter ego of Eminem, introduced in his 1997 extended play The Slim Shady EP. Conceived during a period of personal and professional struggle, Slim Shady allowed Eminem to express his darker, more aggressive thoughts through exaggerated and often violent lyrical content. This persona embodies the chaotic, satirical side of Eminem's music, pushing boundaries with provocative, sometimes offensive, themes, which blend fiction and reality. The use of Slim Shady is shown in The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Encore, Relapse, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, Kamikaze, Music to Be Murdered By, and The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce).

Slim Shady's influence on Eminem's career is significant. His shock-value content helped skyrocket the rapper to fame, but also attracted criticism and legal challenges, particularly due to songs like ""'97 Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""Kim"", where he addresses deeply personal and often disturbing subjects, such as family conflicts and imagined violence. Despite the controversy, the Slim Shady character is credited with much of Eminem's early success, but over time, the persona also contributed to the rapper's personal struggles, including substance abuse.

Another character is Ken Kaniff, a gay man who pokes fun at Eminem's songs. Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on The Slim Shady LP, where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem. An argument after the album's release prompted Eminem to use the Kaniff character on The Marshall Mathers LP and later albums (except Encore and Recovery). Aristotle, angry with Eminem's use of his character, released a mixtape in his Kaniff persona ridiculing him.

Acting Career

After small roles in the 2001 film The Wash and as an extra in the 1998 Korn music video for ""Got the Life"" (during which he gave the band a demo tape), Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the semi-autobiographical 2002 film 8 Mile. He said it was a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including ""Lose Yourself"" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running No. 1 hip-hop single in history). Eminem was absent from the ceremony and co-composer Luis Resto accepted the award.

Eminem voiced an aging, corrupt, AAVE-speaking police officer in the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof and guested on the Comedy Central television show Crank Yankers and a Web cartoon, The Slim Shady Show He was signed to star in an unmade film version of Have Gun – Will Travel, and was considered for the role of David Rice in the 2008 film Jumper. Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with Ray Romano, in the 2009 film Funny People. In a 2010 interview with Jonathan Ross, he stated ""You know, I love music so much. This is my passion, this is what I want to do. Not saying that I won't do a movie ever again, but this is me.""

He played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale ""Lose Yourself"" with Christina Aguilera. Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because director Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit. Eminem had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2014 film The Interview. During an interview with the main character, Dave Skylark (James Franco), Eminem satirically comes out as gay.

Books and memoirs

On November 21, 2000, Eminem published Angry Blonde, a non-fiction book featuring a commentary of several of his own songs, along with several previously unpublished photographs.

On October 21, 2008, his autobiography The Way I Am was published. The book was first published on October 21, 2008, by Dutton Adult. It is a collection of Eminem's personal stories, reflections, photographs, original artwork, and original lyric sheets from ""Stan"" and ""The Real Slim Shady"". It details his struggles with poverty, drugs, fame, heartbreak, family and depression, along with stories about his rise to fame and commentary on past controversies. The book is illustrated with never before published photos of Eminem's life. It also contains original drawings, previously unpublished lyric sheets, and other rare memorabilia. The autobiography is named after his 2000 song ""The Way I Am"".

An autobiography of Eminem's mother (My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem) was published the following month, in which Debbie Nelson describes her childhood and adolescence, meeting Eminem's father and her son's rise to (and struggles with) fame.

Maes naît le 10 janvier 1995 à Villepinte en Seine-Saint-Denis. Il grandit à la cité des Beaudottes à Sevran avec ses deux parents, ses cinq frères et ses deux sœurs. Maes commence à rapper à l'âge de 14 ans ; avec ses amis Radmo et SY, ils forment le groupe MSR. Après le lycée, il effectue un séjour de 18 mois à la maison d'arrêt de Villepinte de début 2016 à fin 2017. 

Durant son incarcération, Maes sort son premier projet, une mixtape intitulée Réelle Vie. Quelque temps après sa sortie de prison, il se fait remarquer avec la série de clips #MaesEstLibérable ; il assure ensuite notamment la première partie du groupe 13 Block lors d'un concert à La Bellevilloise le 10 décembre 2017. Le 2 mars 2018, le rappeur sort sa deuxième mixtape : Réelle Vie 2.0.

Maes signe sur le label Millenium, filiale de Capitol Music France, quelques mois après la sortie de ce projet. 

En juillet 2018, Maes publie la chanson Billets verts, qui remporte un gros succès et sera certifiée or en France. Quelque trois mois après, il sort Avenue Montaigne (d'après la luxueuse artère parisienne). Ce single est suivi par Madrina en collaboration avec Booba. Maes annonce alors la sortie de son premier album studio : Pure.

Tourné à Bogota, le clip de Madrina paraît fin novembre 2018. Deux jours après, le 30 novembre 2018 l'album sort. Ce premier opus s'écoule à 17 047 exemplaires dès la première semaine.

99,moro,16912,304889,"Moro is one of two artists:

1) Hardcore arranger, principal arranger of KINZOK ON from Japan.
Also known as morrrrrro
KINZOK ON bandcamp: https://kinzokon.bandcamp.com/music
MORO on Twitter: https://twitter.com/moro_108


2) Moro is a beast composed of two reasonably-sentient beings: Nolan Thomas and Daniel Lee Ruff Smith, and born in the hills surrounding a village known as Eau Claire, WI. The beast is sometimes called ""M o r o"", or ""M O R O"" by different tribes.

After writhing in front of crowds of jubilant townsfolk a few times, and Lee Ruff taking a brief absence to travel to the Land of Thais, it regurgitated it's first offspring-- ""Embers""-- in a fiery cough. The townsfolk went mad for it, but it was too jittery to stay in one place, so it travelled throughout the globe on the back of the root-god Pando, whom some know as The Interwebs, among other names. The child was aided in it's travels by MJMJ Records and many friends.

Then Lee Ruff heard callings from afar, and split from it's Nolan-half to gain knowledge in the far off land of España for one half an earth cycle. Though less powerful due to their separation, the two beings were able to communicate with the aid of their friend-god Pando, speaking into his roots and sensing the vibrations on the other end. 

With a seed planted in their minds by the ancient tree-and-worker guardians, Simon & Garfunkel, they combined their powers and dreamed into existence their second child, ""Sound of Silence"". This child was requested of them by the Pando-rider Cactus-Mouth, who then took it forth along the roots and raised it as his own. 

It was then that Nolan-half began to feel unsatisfied with his choice to study the ancient and time-honored craft of Illustration, and made leave from the temple of UW-Eau Claire, at least for a time. With his newfound freedom and an approaching 21st birth-festival, his mother, Keli, offered forth the means for Nolan-half to visit the city København, in the realm of Danmark-- close to the Witch Woods of Sverige, where the Old Gods dwell. He sought refuge with his pal-being Mirko, and stayed in the living room of two wonderful she-Danes. 

By some chance of fate, Lee Ruff was also in the region, and the two beings were able to briefly reunite in the north-country of Uppsala, deep within the Witch Woods of Sverige. It was a long and perilous journey for Nolan-half, battling Sex-Trolls and SJ Railways, and his ability to communicate with Pando grew weak, causing many confusions. But through it all, he eventually found the Lee Ruff, and all was merry. Moro stomped as one through the halls of Upsalla by day, and gazed into it's clear pools by night, discussing with reasonable-sentience the nature of The Creator or The Great Unknown. Cats and ducks came to listen in and gain knowledge, but were keen to hide their own sentience. 

Alas, Moro was forced to split once again, returning to Eau Claire and España respectively. Nolan-half used up all his coins on food and travel in Danmark and Sverige, and now really really needs to get a job.

The two halves of Moro have resolved to sleep until June of the earth-cycle 2011, when they can be reunited once more in the village Eau Claire, and writhe for crowds and spew forth new offspring, and send them forth into the world with Pando and alive with Moro's magical instruments, and travel throughout the land with village-friends and make many many anew. The beast will be unstoppable. maybe. It will never stop dreaming.

5ive are an instrumental band from Boston, MA formed in 2000 consisting of the duo of Ben Carr and Charlie Harrold. 

In 2001, 5ive released their self titled first studio album on Tortuga Recordings, which included Jeff Caxide (Isis) on bass. Later in the same year, they released their second studio album, The Telestic Disfracture, which included vocals on the first two tracks by Jonah Jenkins (Milligram). In 2003, the band changed their name to 5ive's Continuum Research Project and released, The Hemophiliac Dream (EP) which again included Jeff Caxide (Isis) on bass.

In 2008, they released their third studio album, Hesperus.

5ive mixes space rock, post-metal, experimental and sludge elements that make their sound vast and infinite. Ben Carr in an interview with Carl Shultz: ""5ive shapes tones and experiments with analog waveforms. Our sound has always been described as an organic sound, it has natural truth to it and though it is not always a happy or uplifting message, you cannot deny it"".

He attended Morgan Park High School, where he was part of the marching band as well as a Latin jazz band. He also learned to play percussion instruments like congas and timbales.

He transferred to Columbia College Chicago in 2007 to pursue a degree in music business. After performing a tribute to Ray Charles at one of the campus's talent shows, he received positive feedback and realized his vocal ability, saying that the ""music was just taking over"".

With guidance from his cousin Willie Taylor, of Day26 fame, as well as producer Mick Schultz (who Jeremih met during his time at Columbia College Chicago), Jeremih released his debut single Birthday Sex in March 2009, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100.

By the end of that year though, he would then collaborate with Chance the Rapper for a Christmas project entitled Merry Christmas Lil Mama, which was reissued two more times in 2017 and 2020 with new tracks.

In February 2017, Jeremih released the upcoming album's planned lead single ""I Think of You"" featuring fellow singer Chris Brown and rapper Big Sean.

As he grew his fanbase and released more projects, Lonely forged relationships with many contemporaries in the Atlanta-area scene like BigSmokeChapo. He closely works with producer Clayco. He also frequently works with producers in the Underworld Music Group, an artist and producer group created by Clayco.

Lonely is affiliated with BigSmokeChapo’s Addicted To Money. He was later signed to Playboi Carti’s Opium label in early 2021, along with Ken Carson and Homixide Gang.

Always business-savvy, Choppa turned down a $3 million dollar deal and opted for a partnership with UnitedMasters, a company that distributes his music while allowing him to keep his masters.

125,dj khaled,2502772,49402219,"Khaled Mohammed Khaled (/ˈkælɪd/; born November 26, 1975),[3] known professionally as DJ Khaled, is an American DJ, record producer, and record executive. Originally a Miami-based radio personality, Khaled has since become known for enlisting high-profile music industry artists to perform on singles and albums, for which he often serves as hype man. His distinctions are his booming voice presence, ""motivational"" abstractions, and numerous catchphrases. While his musical contribution is often questioned, Khaled's role has been described as ""organization, direction, [and] promotion"".[4][5]

Khaled was born in New Orleans to Palestinian immigrant parents. He first gained recognition as a radio host in the 1990s for the radio station 99 Jamz, and translated his popularity by working with Fat Joe's hip hop collective, Terror Squad, as a DJ for their live performances. Following his production credits on the group's material,[6] Khaled enlisted several hip hop artists associated with the group and his native Miami to perform on his debut studio album, Listennn... the Album (2006). His second album, We the Best (2007), spawned the hit single ""I'm So Hood"" (featuring T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross and Plies). His two subsequent releases—We Global (2008) and Victory (2010)—both peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200; the latter was supported by the single ""All I Do Is Win"" (featuring T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross), which received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

His fifth studio album and major label debut, We the Best Forever (2011), saw continued commercial success and brought Khaled to mainstream prominence by spawning his first Billboard Hot 100-top ten single, ""I'm on One"" (featuring Drake, Rick Ross and Lil Wayne). His following three albums—Kiss the Ring (2012), Suffering from Success (2013), and I Changed a Lot (2015)—were released to moderate critical and commercial reception.[7] Throughout 2015 and 2016, Khaled gained wider recognition as a public figure due to his social media activity. This, along with several Internet memes, foresaw the release of his ninth studio album, Major Key (2016), which was met with further critical and commercial success as it debuted atop the Billboard 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.

His tenth album, Grateful (2017), became his second consecutive number-one album and was preceded by the singles ""I'm the One"" (featuring Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) and ""Wild Thoughts"" (featuring Rihanna and Bryson Tiller), which peaked at numbers one and two on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. His eleventh album, Father of Asahd (2019), contained the song ""Higher"" (featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend), which won Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards—Khaled's first Grammy Award win. His eponymous twelfth album (2021) and thirteenth album, God Did (2022), both debuted atop the Billboard 200. The latter's title track (featuring Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, John Legend and Fridayy) earned three nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance.

Outside of music, Khaled has gained success as a writer, with his book The Keys featuring on the New York Times Best Seller list. He has also performed as an actor for the films Spies in Disguise (2019) and Bad Boys for Life (2020). His record label, We the Best Music Group has distributed his releases since its formation in 2008, though Khaled signed other artists to the imprint including Ace Hood, Kent Jones, Mavado, Flipp Dinero, and Vado, among others. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Khaled"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

126,denzel curry,1344542,121958906,"Denzel Rae Don Curry (born February 16, 1995) is an American rapper raised in Carol City, Florida. Curry started rapping while in sixth grade and on September 24, 2011, at age 16, released his first mixtape, titled King Remembered Underground Tape 1991–1995. The entire project was later included on SpaceGhostPurrp's Facebook page, prompting the birth of his music career. Following the release of Curry's first mixtape, he became a member of SpaceGhostPurrp's hip-hop collective, Raider Klan, and a frequent collaborator of Miami music-art group Metro Zu.

Curry left Raider Klan in 2013, releasing his debut studio album, Nostalgic 64, in September of that year, while still in high school. He has since released three extended plays: 32 Zel/Planet Shrooms in 2015, 13 in 2017, and UNLOCKED (a collaboration with Kenny Beats) in 2020, and four studio albums: Imperial in 2016, Ta13oo in 2018, Zuu in 2019, and Melt My Eyez See Your Future in 2022. TA13OO, ZUU, and Melt My Eyez debuted at numbers 28, 32, and 51 on the Billboard 200 chart, respectively, with Melt My Eyez returning at number 17 after the release of an extended edition. All of his projects have garnered significant critical acclaim.

In 2012, he released his second mixtape, titled King of the Mischievous South Vol. 1 Underground Tape 1996, which caught the attention of fellow American rapper Earl Sweatshirt and other members of Odd Future label.

Curry's third mixtape, titled Strictly for My R.V.I.D.X.R.S., was released after the death of Trayvon Martin, who also lived in Carol City and went to the same high school as Denzel Curry. His rap style on this mixtape was inspired by 2PAC. On June 9, 2015, Curry released his first double EP, titled 32 Zel/Planet Shrooms. His first release in 2016 was the single ""Flying Nimbus"".

His second full-length album, titled Imperial, was released on March 9, 2016, then re-released later on Spotify as the deluxe version on October 14, 2016. In June 2016, Curry was featured on a cover as one of the XXL's 2016's Freshmen Class.

On May 13, 2017, Curry uploaded a track entitled ""Hate Government [demo]"" to his SoundCloud account. In the weeks that followed, he released two more demos for songs entitled ""Equalizer [demo]"" and ""ZELTRON 6 BILLION ft. Lil Ugly Mane."" After these releases as well as a series of cryptic posts on social media (seemingly portraying another alter ego called Zeltron), he released an EP entitled 13 on June 25, 2017. All of the demo tracks were included on the EP as well as two other new songs. On August 18, 2017, Curry released another song called ""Skywalker."" Later that year, on September 22, a remastered version of 32 Zel was released, including a remix of ""Ultimate"" featuring Juicy J.

On April 2, 2018, Curry released the lead single off of Ta13oo titled, ""Sumo"" on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show. On May 24, 2018, Curry released the second single off the album titled, ""Percs"". Curry then released the third single titled, ""Clout Cobain"", on July 13, 2018, and announced that his album TA13OO, would be released in three acts: The first act, Light, was released on July 25, followed by Gray on July 26, and Dark on July 27. Each previously released single represents one of the album's acts, as ""Sumo"" represents Light, ""Clout Cobain"" represents Gray, and ""Percs"" represents Dark, which comes together cohesively to form TA13OO. TA13OO features guest appearances from GoldLink, JID, JPEGMAFIA, ZillaKami and more.

On January 5, 2022, the official trailer for Curry's fifth studio album, titled Melt My Eyez See Your Future, was uploaded to his YouTube channel. It was revealed that the album would contain guest appearances from artists such as T-Pain, 6lack, Slowthai, Rico Nasty, J.I.D, and Thundercat, among others. Curry said the project would feature a new, more mature sound, different from his previous works: ""Y'all are not going to hear the same type of Denzel anymore."" On January 24, a single titled ""Walkin"", along with a Western-inspired music video directed by Adrian Villagomez, was released. Curry also said the album ""is made up of everything that I couldn't include on Ta13oo or Imperial because I was going through depression and anger issues"", and would take inspiration from traditional hip-hop, drum and bass, trap, poetry, and jazz. The same day, a North American and European tour promoting the album (with guest acts Kenny Mason, Mike Dimes, Redveil, and PlayThatBoiZay) was announced. On February 24, Curry released another single from the upcoming album, ""Zatoichi"" featuring Slowthai. It was accompanied by a music video also directed by Adrian Villagomez. On March 18, Curry announced the album would be released on March 25. On March 21, a third single, ""Troubles"" featuring T-Pain, was released along with a music video. The album was released on March 25, 2022. It debuted at number 51 on the Billboard 200 chart, and at number 23 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

Curry recorded a song featuring rapper Reason, ""1st Quarter"", as a contribution to Apple Music's ""collection of exclusively commissioned new songs from Black creatives"", titled Juneteenth 2022: Freedom Songs. He commented: ""It's an accomplishment to make it through the first quarter of my life. Especially as a Black man in America"".

Curry's song featuring PlayThatBoiZay, ""Let It All Hang Out"", was included in Elvis—a biographical movie about Elvis Presley that premiered in June 2022—as well as on the movie's soundtrack album.

On June 24, 2022, a collaboration between Dot da Genius, JID, Curry, and Kid Cudi, titled ""Talk About Me"", was released, along with a music video directed by Cole Bennett.  On June 29, 2022, Curry performed an NPR Tiny Desk Concert. On July 21, he performed ""Walkin"" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

On September 30, 2022, Curry released Melt My Eyez See Your Future (The Extended Edition). The album features reimagined versions of songs from the original album with live instrumentation performed by the Cold Blooded Soul Band, which performed with Curry on his NPR Tiny Desk Concert and The Tonight Show performance. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Denzel+Curry"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

2) Japanese hip-hop artist
3) Hard rock band from Chicago (who later moved to L.A.) in the 90's .. see Üzi.
4) An '80s no wave/post-punk band from USA.
5) Lithuanian rap group in the 90's
6) German-Polish horrorcore rapper
7)  Punk band from Bogotá, Colombia 
8) A french hip hop artist
9) A Turkish hip hop artist

1)  Uzi was a duo that consisted of Gab3 and Mik3 aka Young Forever.

2) Uzi (pronounced as ""Uji"") is a Japanese hip-hop artist. He has released four major albums, most recently his “Natural 9” album released in March 2008. Uzi is one of the rappers to incorporate more overt elements of Japanese culture into his music and videos, specifically aspects referring to the samurai (to which he claims direct ancestry). He is a great example of an artist who maintains the localization of hip-hop music through his dependence on the incorporation of Japanese themes into his work. Such non-Americanization of his hip-hop music has been met with varying opinions; some view this as disrespectful of the origins of hip-hop culture, while there are those who appreciate Uzi’s apparent embracing of Japanese culture. 

3) 3) Hard rock band from Chicago (who later moved to L.A.) in the 90's .. see Üzi.

4) The American Uzi was a ten-handed combo that burned briefly but brightly in the fertile post-Burma Boston music scene of the mid-1980's. Its founding members were drummer Danny Lee and guitarist/singer/lyricist Thalia Zedek. The basic stylistic conflict between Thalia's garage-based rock 'n' roll background and Danny's more high-tech, modernistic approach gave the group much of its unique edge and led, as well, to its early demise.

Lee and Zedek were joined in late 1983 by bassist Randy Barnwell, guitar-effects whiz Bob Young, and tape specialist Phil Milstein. Barnwell was replaced by Craig Federhen for a brief basement interlude, but returned before Uzi's first show and continued with them for the bulk of the band's duration.

Sleep Asylum was recorded sporadically between 1984-85, including a period when Uzi was between bass players and used Dave Shibler in a session role. Irv Ziskind became the group's final bassist just after Sleep Asylum was completed. His addition cemented Uzi's lineup and provoked them to a new songwriting peak, but Zedek and Lee found themselves moving further and further into their respective corners. Uzi was dismatled just before Sleep Asylum's release in the spring of '86, and never did get to record another album's worth of great material they had written.

Uzi's breakup caught Homestead Records holding the bag on yet another of its many posthumous releases. Consequently, in spite of initial critical acclaim, Sleep Asylum never reached much beyond the East coast of the U.S. Once out of print, continuing word-of-mouth delivered Sleep Asylum to its current status as one of those records heard of more than heard.

5) Lithuanian rap group in the 90's

6) Uzi (* August 7th, 1985 in Toruń, Poland as Thomasz Michaelis) is a German-Polish rapper. He founded the record label Hirntot Records together with Blokkmonsta. He currently lives in Berlin-Tempelhof, Germany.

7)  UZI is a punk band from Bogotá, Colombia.

8) A french hip hop artist

9) Utku Yalçınkaya aka. UZI, 1998 İstanbul, Beyoğlu doğumludur. Hayatının çoğu kısmını Güngören'de geçiren UZI‘nin, rap müzik ile tanışması kuzenleri aracılığıyla ilkokul üçüncü sınıfta gerçekleşiyor. UZI'nin ilk mahlası “Çavo'ydu(Chavo)”. Bu mahlas İspanyollardan gelmekteydi. Mahlasında değişiklik arayan UZI, en sonunda bir abisi tarafından “Bu çocuk rap yaparken tarıyor” demesinden esinlenerek mahlasını “UZI” olarak belirlemiştir.

2018 yılında M.O.B bünyesine katıldıktan sonra parçalarını Lil Murda ile birlikte “GNG” isminde yayınladılar. GNG olarak ilk albümünü “Output Nr.1” isminde yayınlayıp büyük bir ivme yakaladılar. Albümün çıkış parçası “Hızlı Sokaklar” ise büyük ilgi toplayarak UZI‘nin yükselmesine basamak olmuştur.

Daha sonrasında GNG grubunu ayıran UZI, müziğine tek başına devam etme kararı almıştır. 2019 yılında “Favela” adlı EP albümü piyasaya süren UZI, “Favela” parçasıyla global playlistlere girerek gözleri üstüne çekmeyi başarmıştır.

2020 yılında ise yayınladığı teklilerle Türkçe Sözlü Rap müziğe hızlı giren UZI, yılın sonuna doğru “Makina” şarkısını çıkararak ülke çapında büyük bir işe imza atmıştır.

Yükselişine hızlıca devam eden UZI, 2021 yılının Mart ayında ilk stüdyo albümü “Kan‘ı” yayınlayarak müzik sektörü ve medyanın ilgisini çekerek kendini müzik piyasasına tanıtmıştır. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Uzi"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

131,dpr ian,539572,41411761,"Born and raised in Sydney, Australia, DPR IAN (Christian Yu) developed a fondness for music and performance at an early age. A childhood fascination with electronic duo  Daft Punk's seminal album Discovery and the musical Cats gave him a keen awareness of the importance of visual presentation. As a teen, he taught himself the drums and started a heavy metal band, playing and writing songs by ear. He was later drawn to b-boying and breakdancing as a form of physical self-expression, skipping class to busk in downtown Sydney and documenting his freestyles on Youtube.
His channel gave him an audience, and it even connected him with his future DPR collaborator and friend Hong Da-Bin (also known as DPR LIVE). After graduating from his performing arts school in 2008, he bought an one-way ticket to Seoul to pursue his dreams as a dancer. He debuted as the leader and rapper of K-Pop group C-Clown in 2012, performing as Rome.
His experience as an Idol was short lived and tumultuous - the unit disbanded in 2015 -but it did give him a better understanding of the industry. So when he synched back with his friend Hong and Scott Kim (DPR REM) to discuss making something together, he knew that he wanted the next stage of his career to be rooted in creative freedom, authenticity, and community.

The mixtape featured cameos from friends like Lil Yachty, Young Thug, and Gunna, and strong production from 808 Mafia, Brickz, and many others, highlighted by Lil Baby's woozy flows. The mixtape immediately brought the young rapper fame, in part due to his affiliations with friends in the Quality Control family of artists as well as the 4 Pockets Full clique. As his mixtape attracted more listeners, Lil Baby worked constantly on new music, releasing singles like ""My Dawg"" and the Young Thug collaboration ""Pink Slip"""" in the summer of 2017.

Durk is best known for his involvement in the drill wave that took the music world by storm in the 2010s. He is the founder of his own record label, Only the Family (OTF).

Durk’s early career was, like many drill artists, plagued with legal issues and accusations of violence. These issues eventually led to his shows being canceled.

In 2012, his career took off with the release of “L’s Anthem” and its French Montana-featuring remix. In 2013, he continued his hot streak with “Dis Ain’t What U Want,” a conscious reflection on his perception in the media and throughout his city. In 2015, he released his debut studio album Remember My Name and the viral sensation, “My Beyoncé” with DeJ Loaf.

Between 2016 and 2020, Durk went on to drop several new installments of his series Signed to the Streets and Just Cause Y’all Waited. At the same time, he faced renewed legal challenges stemming from an Atlanta shooting. Regardless of the circumstances, he persisted, gaining yet another viral hit as a feature on Drake’s “Laugh Now Cry Later.” He also gained traction with the Lil Baby and Polo G assisted “3 Headed Goat.”

The scars of violence run deep in Durk’s discography, particularly stemming from the loss of OTF members Nunu (Nuski) and King Von at the hands of gunfire.

157,gucci mane,2399227,50610363,"Radric Davis (born February 12, 1980 in Birmingham, Alabama), better known by his stage name Gucci Mane, is an American rapper and CEO of 1017 Brick Squad Records. In 2005 he released his independent debut album, Trap House, which featured the successful single ""Icy"" that he recorded with Young Jeezy. He has since released a further three albums including 2006's Hard To Kill, 2007's Trap-A-Thon and 2007's Back To The Trap House. His sixth studio album, The State vs Radric Davis, was released in December 2009, just weeks after he was sent back to prison for 12 months for violating his probation. He was released in May 2010 and will now release his seventh studio album, The Appeal: Georgia's Most Wanted, sometime at the end of 2010.

It’s said that art mirrors life. In hip-hop’s case, there’s always been a deliberate entanglement of perception and reality. Fans demand their MCs be real…but never too real. Successful hip-hop is about the hint of the danger, the tease of it, the mystique. Hip-hop is about balance.

Gucci Mane is an artist striving for that balance, volatility versus musicality. Controversy, including a feud with former collaborator Young Jeezy, has grabbed the headlines, with insufficient regard paid to his considerable mic skills, raw talent, and business acumen. Gucci is looking to wrest his name from public speculation and let his own words do the talking.

“I wish everybody well who’s making money in this rap game,” the Atlanta-raised rapper says, dismissing the controversy that followed him in the past. “My own rap game is going so good, I’ve got so many things on my plate at my label, that I don’t got time for other people’s business.” With a deal with Asylum Records as the boss of his own label, So Icey Entertainment, Gucci does indeed have a full schedule with no time to dwell on the past.

“I live my life with no regrets. I just wish that a lot of things never happened, but anybody can wish,” says Gucci. Sounds like a man with his eyes on the prize. And you’d expect nothing less from an artist who ground his way to the top via the hustle of independent records. Signing to Big Cat Records in the wake of his local single “Black Tee,” he dropped his debut record, Trap House, in May 2005. The independent album moved an impressive 140,000 units, largely on the strength of the “Icy” single, featuring Jeezy. Clamor over song rights sparked dispute, and the resulting rift grew.

Controversy notwithstanding, Mane’s independence was cemented: “I was on the independent scene for about two years,” he recalls. “It’s crazy! You gotta go into your own pocket to support your craft. You need other avenues to have money coming in, to support your stuff. You might win, you might lose, and it’s a gamble out there with the independent circuit. One thing you’d better have is good music because without that, you go downhill fast in the independent game.”

Good music firmly in hand, Gucci was fast approaching stardom when more tragedy befell him. But let’s backtrack; how did the man born Radric Davis in Bessemer, Alabama, become Gucci Mane, mouthpiece for Atlanta stuntin’? Mane remembers little from his time in Alabama, just that it was rural, and that it’s changed dramatically since he left at the age of nine. “I gotta shout out Alabama though, because they holdin’ it down,” he affirms. “Every time I go there to do a show, I’m impressed with how hip-hop culture has taken root.”

Mane’s identity coalesced when he moved with his mother to Atlanta. “I lived all of my adolescent and adult life in Atlanta,” he explains. “I’m from East Atlanta Zone Six; it was hard, man, it was real rough. I grew up in the Starter jacket era: they’d take your Starter jacket, your 8Ball jacket, they’d take your hat, your shoes. It was just no holds barred on the streets, dog eat dog. If you missed the bus, you had to be crewed up or you’d get jumped. It was wild when I came up.”

It’s a bleak portrait. When asked to describe his home life more vividly, Mane offers a look into his contemplative side, a side honed as a schoolyard poet. “I was just a young dude in a single parent house most of my life. I can’t complain that much. I would guess it’s like any black child growing up in a single parent household. There are a lot of people who know how that is. I didn’t have a lot coming up; but what I did have, I appreciated. I was blessed to have a caring mother to raise me right and to help me with my business ventures; she’s been there through the whole struggle. There’s a lot that goes along with that; it made me who I am today.”

A stepfather would enter the picture during Mane’s adolescence, introducing not only a male figure, but also inspiration for Mane’s unusual moniker. “My father came in, the original Gucci Mane; that’s what people in the neighborhood called him, and that’s where I get my name from. From then on, I grew up the son of a hustler and a schoolteacher; it was the best of both worlds because I was educated twice.” Drawing inspiration from a pantheon of rappers before him –Big Daddy Kane, LL Cool J, Ice Cube, the Beastie Boys, N.W.A—Mane went on to release Trap House, a lethal brew of his signature sound: “I call my music straight Gucci: going hard and whatever beats you make you for me, if I’m feeling it, if I’m rocking with it, I’m gonna crush it. When you hear me, you hear a lot of pain, a lot of hood; you hear what’s going on in the inner city in Atlanta.”

Unfortunately, Trap House was ill timed; the month of its release, Gucci was accused of murder and jailed for two days. Eventually deemed to be acting in self-defense, and without sufficient evidence to hold him, Mane was exonerated. But the ordeal left an indelible imprint on the man. “I learned to keep better company, watch where I go, and be mindful of my surroundings at all times,” he reveals. “Watch what I say, watch what I do and how I do it, just keep myself out of the wrong crowd.”

“I always stand up man,” he continues. “I’m one of the toughest guys I know. It’ll take a lot more than that to break me down.” Undeterred, Mane was back in the studio, preparing 2006’s eerily apropos Hard To Kill. The buzz from Hard To Kill vaulted Gucci Mane from regional commodity to national treasure, and major labels responded accordingly: “There was a bidding war going on, and I liked Atlantic’s approach. They made it known that they wanted me, they felt where I was going and that I could grow with them.”

Asylum/Atlantic Records welcomed Gucci Mane in early ’07, granting him his own imprint, So Icey Entertainment. With it comes an entire stable of artists, the So Icey Boyz. As the Boyz ready for their own exposure –“I got them in training; they be in the weight room, pumping iron, doing pushups, shopping at the mall, buying ice”—Gucci is focused on his magnum opus, Back to the Trap House. “I started working on the album, and by the third song, I was like ‘This is going back to the Trap House.’ I started feeling the same way I did when I made my first album. It had the same feel to it, the same freshness. And I had the same hunger and desire I had when I first started rapping.”

“Since I went major, I want everybody to know I’m still keeping it street, keeping it hood,” Gucci maintains. “I’m trying to take it back to all my fans that I had when I first started my career. And at the same time, I’m trying to open up my new album to a new fan base. So it’s a mix for everybody coming together, like my first album was.” Gucci has always prided himself on his innate ability, and his refusal to let guest appearances dictate the tone of his records. “I just want people to know I’m a great songwriter, man,” he asserts. “I’m passionate about what I do, and it’s choreographed strategically when I do it. I bring a lot of experience, creative wordplay, and a crazy style. And my albums, I record most of the songs without writing them down; it’s a God-given gift and I just get paid for it. It come from God, it’s like wondering what makes a bird fly. He made me a poet like the great poets of the past.”

But don’t mistake Gucci’s confidence for self-absorption. The vicissitudes of his career have dictated a longer view. Lyrics aside, he’s less preoccupied with visible means and more so with acting as an emissary from his under-repped block. “I’m not the one to glorify what goes on in the hood,” he insists. “We have everything there, the whole range from violence to people getting on the bus and going to work. There’s a lot more to the hood than just drugs. It’s a bigger story, there’s a big picture. I went to school in that neighborhood, I worked there, I trapped there, I hustled there, and I got my name there. I’m proud to be from East Atlanta Zone Six, and I claim there. I hold that on my back and carry that, to be the first one from there to really rock.”

And Gucci’s professional aims have matured as well. While other rappers stress platinum plaques, Gucci hasn’t forgotten the route he took to stardom. “I made a lot of CDs on my own. People fucked with me and supported me, and just made me the man I am today. That’s my blueprint right there, and I stay mindful of it. So now, my only concern is that people feel my music; at the end of the day, I do it for people to feel it. If one person feel it, two people feel it, I feel like my job’s been done.”

Fortunately for Gucci, he should be prepared to welcome an army of new fans with Back to the Trap House. But longstanding fans shouldn’t fear; they’ll recognize “Freaky Gurl,” reprised from its previous appearance from Hard To Kill. Luda, upon hearing the joint, asked for a guest spot on the remix. Said remix now appears as the lead single on Back to the Trap House, following in Gucci’s theme of mating old and new. Over a bouncing, meandering beat from Cyber Sapp, the two cook up the requisite concoction of whips, chips, and chicks. Also look out for “Bird Flu,” the album’s number two single, laced by New-York based Supa Sonics. Elsewhere, firm guest verses from Rich Boy and Pimp C of UGK round out Gucci’s regional flavor, while Bay-area producer Zaytoven (of “Icy” renown) locks down Gucci’s West Coast appeal.

Gucci Mane has something for everyone, and with the struggles of the past in his rearview, Gucci is settled in for his ride to the top. “I’m best known for controversy but I’m trying to gain respect as a songwriter and entertainer. I plan to hit them so hard with this album; who knows what the future will bring. I’ll be banging them out till I can’t bang no more.”

Rodriquez ""Jacquees"" Broadnax was born April 15, 1994 in Atlanta, GA. He found his passion for both singing and dancing at the age of 9 with influences from The Jackson's: An American Dream and The Temptations movies; imitating no less than the greatest. Jacquees participated in his first talent show in fifth grade at Canby Lane Elementary School performing the Jackson 5's, ""I Want You Back,"" winning 1st place. He successfully matriculated to Mary McCleod Bethune Middle School where he continued to compete in talent shows winning every year; two at Bethune Middle and one at the Dekalb County Middle School Talent Show. 

In 2007, Jacquees was introduced to his manager, Orlando Grind, by Dexx Lee. After years of performing in local talent shows, Orlando soon introduced him to Russell ""Block"" Spencer, founder and CEO of Block Entertainment. When Jacquees started going to the studio he merely blended with the team and wasn't given the opportunity to express his true talents. ""When you see work being done around you but not for you, you tend to get discouraged,"" says Jacquees. At that time, Block's focus was only rap, not R&B. It wasn't until summer of 2009 when Block witnessed how talented Jacquees was and shifted his vision. Jacquees began to work closely with Block Entertainment recording and gaining more exposure with the release of his first single ""Krazy"" featuring Grand Hustle's own, T.I. 

Jacquees has recorded with label mates, Gorilla Zoe and Scotty, T.I.P, and an upcoming Atlanta rapper, J-Real. Jacquees dreams to work with established artist Lil Wayne, Drake, Justin Bieber, Bow Wow, Lil' Chuckee, Chris Brown, and many more. ""All of these artists started out at the age I am and are successful in the industry. I look up to them and dream that I will be just as successful as they are,"" Jacquees explains. ""Only better!"" 

""It's truly a blessing to have the opportunity to work with the artist and producers I have already worked with,"" says Jacquees. ""I pray to God every night that I continue on this journey and achieve what I've always dreamed of doing. With God on my side, I know this is only the beginning and there is more to come."" With that in mind, Jacquees will achieve any and everything he wants out of the music industry.

166,saint jhn,867786,19232361,"In the words of SAINt JHN:

""Nobody needs to write a bio for me. This is stupid. My name is SAINt JHN, that's my real name, it's spelled a little different tho. I'm from Brooklyn, I spent half of my childhood growing up in Georgetown, Guyana. I was dirt poor in Brooklyn and some version of rich in Guyana, because apparently 2 nickles can buy you a sports car in a 3rd world country. Who knew?! I'm from a SUPER Christian household where my mom forced us to go to every church imaginable, EVERY, SINGLE, WEEK! I hated it. I still won't go to church to this day. I'm a product of a father that was a hustler, preacher for a mother and a rapper for an older brother. Jay z and Beenie Man were my musical hero's growing up. I don't know how to describe the music I make, don't know what genre it belongs to and I don't exactly care. I make what I want to hear and paint the pictures that I want to see in the world. I got my start writing songs for other people, I got lucky I don't know how that happened but I did. I wrote some records for Usher, Kiesza, Gorgon City and a few other people. I was having success, but then I quit, cause who wants to live their dreams through someone else's eyes. So I put out my first project, Collection One. And here we are now, I hope you like whatever comes next cause I have no fvcking idea!""

A collision of feelings, ideas, and misty ambiance, SAINt JHN's music is a living mosaic. Pulling from his dual upbringing in Guyana and Brooklyn, he swirls themes of love, joy and sorrow with emotive R&B, Hip-Hop and Afrofusion into an inimitable kaleidoscope of sounds and sensations. You could call it genre-fluid but it's easier to say it's SAINt JHN, a singer-songwriter and model who has earned two Grammy Awards and a global fan base while becoming one of the most distinct voices in the world of music.

SAINt JHN has since released his fourth studio album ""Festival Season"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/SAINt+JHN"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

171,50 cent,4197808,87122709,"Curtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975 in South Jamaica, Queens, New York), better known by his stage name 50 Cent, is a Grammy award nominated rapper, actor, singer, entrepreneur, author and founder of the hip hop group and label G-Unit. 

Jackson was born and raised in South Jamaica, a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. His mother Sabrina, a drug dealer, died in a fire when he was 8. Since his father had already abandoned the family, young Curtis was sent to live with his grandparents. Growing up during the crack epidemic of the 80s and 90s, Jackson dealt drugs when he wasn't ""killing time"" at school or boxing at a local gym. His grandparents assumed he was at after-school programs when he was out selling crack. In tenth grade, Jackson was caught with guns and drug money passing through the metal detectors at Andrew Jackson High School in Queens. In 1994, Jackson was arrested again for selling vials of cocaine to an undercover officer, and three weeks later he was arrested yet-again after police found heroin, crack cocaine, and a starter pistol in his home. Jackson was sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison, but opted to join a 6 month boot camp program and get his GED. Around this time, Jackson began going by ""50 Cent,"" inspired by deceased Brooklyn stick-up man Kelvin ""50 Cent"" Martin. 

After leaving drug dealing to pursue a rap career, he released his debut album Guess Who's Back Again in 2002. He was discovered by Eminem and Dr. Dre and then signed to Interscope Records. He has since released Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2003), The Massacre (2006), Curtis (2007) and Before I Self Destruct (2009).

50 Cent has engaged in feuds with other rappers including Jay-Z, Ja Rule, The Game, Cam'ron, Fat Joe, and Rick Ross. He has also pursued an acting career, appearing in the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin' in 2005, the Iraq War film Home of the Brave in 2006, and Righteous Kill in 2008. 50 Cent is one of the richest hip-hop performers, having a net worth estimated at US $440 million in 2008.

Before 50 Cent ever inked a major deal, he built up a substantial fan base in New York through underground mixtapes. 50 Cent met up with Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC and was signed to his label to write all of Jay’s music. After he’d left JMJ, he signed to Columbia Records in 1996. On this label, he released Power of the Dollar, and the singles How to Rob and Ghetto Qua Ran. Columbia Records released him from the label after being shot on May 24th, 2000.

Around this time, Eminem had heard one of 50 Cent’s demo tapes and expressed a huge interest in him on MTV, as did Dr. Dre. Shortly after this, 50 Cent officially signed to Interscope Records. He was the first rapper to sign to the joint label owned by Dr. Dre and Eminem. The first song he released on this record was entitled Wanksta and was featured on the 8 Mile soundtrack.

In its first week of release, his debut ”Get Rich Or Die Tryin’” sold 872,000 units - easily reaching Gold status. Within the second week it went Platinum (1 mil) and on April 12th, 2004 the RIAA certified it six times Platinum.

In 2005 he followed the success of his album Get Rich or Die Tryin’ with a new release - The Massacre (originally called St. Valentines Day Massacre until the release date was pushed back). The first single released off this, Disco Inferno, was a huge hit - he followed this hit up by the release of Candy Shop and then again with Just a Lil Bit.

In 2003 Interscope Records allowed 50 Cent to have his own label - G-Unit Records. He first signed Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck as the established members of G-Unit Records. In 2004, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent had signed The Game under a joint venture. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/50+Cent"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Hailing from the infamous hardcore band Heibel, Cabrón combines a tight driven sound from the 3 Reynders brothers with the powerfull melodic vocals from ex-El Fuse frontman Alejandro Garrido.

Formed somewhere around February 2003 by former Triptych drummer Jo Reynders and ex-El Fuse singer Alejandro Garrido, they line up with Jo's brother Erwin on bass to record their first demo by the end of December 2003 at Patrick Delabie’s Studio 195.
The song “Your lessons learned” wins them national radio Studio Brussels’ demo poll and they start doing concerts with bands like Atomic Bitchwax (US), Mission of Burma (US), Biffy Clyro (UK), Dozer (DK), Los Natas (ARG)…

By the end of February 2005, Erwin and Jo’s younger brother Pé (with whom they had the three piece band Triptych a few years earlier) joins in just when Cabrón gets the attention of full venues at the Magdalenazaal in Brugge and the Muziekodroom in Hasselt where they support Therapy? twice on their European tour.

By the end of October 2005, Rock ‘n Roll Radio release their first 10” split EP on vinyl with Los Natas and Cabrón, on which you can hear remixes of their songs “Burden”, “Parascending” and “Backlash” and you can hear what they sound like as a four piece band.
Buzzville Records release their Buzzville sampler “Rock ‘n Roll Boulevard vol.1” by the end of 2005, which features Cabróns “Parascending” and bands like Gonzales(US), Generous Maria(SW), Honcho(N), Hulk(B), Monkey 3(CH) and many more…

During the winter of 2005-2006 Cabrón heads back to their musical companion Patrick Delabie and his Studio 195 to record their first full CD.
Mastered at the Mastering Room in Sweden by veteran Goran Finnberg (Spiritual Beggars, Blind Dog, Generous Maria, The Quill...), the CD is to be released on Buzzville Records by the end of 2006.

Meanwhile you can check out Cabrón live at a town near you and have a sonic experience that will shake your booty in a slightly different way then you might be used to. It’s that drive folks, that ever continuing drive…

""...driven by full-bodied bass/drums-arrangements..."" ""…it rocks, and it's already a blast when you see a band give their all and do it convincingly..."" ""…the band not only benefits from a fuller sound, but also boasts one hell of a solo player…"" (Guy's Music Review Site) (LIVE at MaZ/Bruges)

""A very tight, concrete, energetic and driven sound, which creates a cross mix between Queens of the Stone Age and AC/DC. Solid rock is what these guys have to offer.""

179,cordae,691154,19438801,"Cordae Amari Dunston (born August 26, 1997), known mononymously as Cordae (formerly known as YBN Cordae and Entendre is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. 

Dunston gained popularity by releasing remixes of popular songs, such as ""My Name Is"" by Eminem, and ""Old N***as"" which was a response to the song ""1985"" by J. Cole. Videos to both remixes were uploaded to the WorldStarHipHop's YouTube channel, which led to an immense and immediate positive response from both mainstream media and the online rap community. His debut studio album, The Lost Boy was released on July 26, 2019 and received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 62nd Grammy Awards. Cordae was a member of the YBN collective from 2018 until the group disbanded in 2020.

Dunston was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, but moved to Suitland, Maryland. As a young child, he'd taken an interest in music as his father would always play classic hip hop around him, from artists such as Rakim, Nas, Big L, and Talib Kweli. He began writing raps around the age of fifteen, but did not take it seriously, as it was only a hobby for him. Following the influence he gained from the music his father listened to, he would do research on certain artists through YouTube, attempting to find similar music and ""getting lost"" in the recommended videos section. Dunston began gaining more interest in pursuing a rap career as he aged, but focused on his education first, although writing lyrics often distracted him from his studies. He released three mixtapes as a teenager under the name ""Entendre"" – Anxiety (2014), I’m So Anxious (2016), and I’m So Anonymous (2017). He graduated from high school in 2015 and decided to go to college at Towson University, later dropping out in 2018, explaining that college was ""bigger than him"" as a first-generation student, and he was mainly doing it for his mother. He moved to Los Angeles shortly afterward.

Dunston began taking his rap career seriously in the beginning of 2018. Although he hadn't been releasing any music with them, he'd often hang around YBN Nahmir and Almighty Jay when visiting Los Angeles, whom he'd initially met through social media. Nahmir had taken interest in a song that Dunston had made with fellow rapper and brother Simba, and reached out to him. Dunston is the only member of YBN that hadn't been introduced to everyone as a gamer, as he doesn't take gaming too seriously. He already felt like he was a part of YBN, the only thing that hadn't solidified his presence being his social media handles, which he soon changed from Entendre to YBN Cordae. He also stated that Entendre had been a name that he'd wanted to change for while, stating ""I was just always around Nahmir and shit, those were just like my brothers... And, I was thinking, yo, I need to change my shit to like, Cordae, and shit, my actual first name. I was already ""YBN"" without the social tag, you know what I'm saying?"" He released his first single, which he called his ""introduction to the world"", in May 2018. It was a remix of the 1999 song ""My Name Is"" by Eminem, which he released along with a music video via WorldStarHipHop on YouTube. Subsequently, he released ""Old N***as"", as a response to ""1985"" by J. Cole, then released the tracks Fighting Temptations and Kung Fu, respectively.

His debut live performance was at the annual Rolling Loud music festival in May 2018, in which he performed with both YBN Nahmir and Almighty Jay. He performed with the duo again for the 2018 XXL Freshman Show in New York City, after Nahmir was announced to be an inductee of the yearly freshman class. Dunston was then announced to be joining Juice WRLD on his North American WRLD Domination tour from May to September 2018, along with Lil Mosey and  Blake, ended up reaching 28 cities. Soon after, it was announced that YBN would be going on a month-long tour in Europe as a collective. Dunston then said he would release multiple singles up until his debut project is complete. On August 2, 2018, both Nahmir and Cordae released a video for their single ""Pain Away"". On August 12, YBN Nahmir announced that an official YBN Mixtape, featuring the trio, would be released September 7, 2018. He released the music video for his single, ""Scotty Pippen"", on August 23, 2018.

On January 28, 2019, Cordae released a music video for a new song titled, ""Locationships"" on his YouTube channel before releasing another song titled, ""Have Mercy"" in March 2019, with the latter song becoming the lead single from his debut studio album, The Lost Boy. He was later named as one of the members of XXL's ""2019 Freshman Class"" on June 20, 2019.[26] Cordae later released ""Bad Idea"" and ""RNP"" as the second and third singles from the album respectively. The Lost Boy was released on July 26, 2019. The album landed YBN Cordae two nominations at the 62nd Grammy Awards; Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song for the single ""Bad Idea"". In November 2019, Cordae announced that he would be headlining ""The Lost Boy in America Tour"", which began in January 2020.

On August 6, 2020, YBN Nahmir took to Twitter to announce that the YBN collective officially disbanded. Cordae subsequently dropped the YBN from his stage name. On August 27, Cordae released a new single, ""Gifted"", featuring Roddy Ricch, marking Cordae's first release of 2020. Cordae has been currently working on his second album. During an interview with Apple Music, he stated, ""I'm like a hundred songs deep in. Like this next one, I'm really taking everything to a whole 'nother level.
